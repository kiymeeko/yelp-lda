0,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
3,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
4,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
5,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
6,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
7,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
8,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
9,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
10,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
11,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
12,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
13,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
14,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
15,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
16,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
17,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
18,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
19,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.

I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
40,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
41,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
42,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
43,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
44,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
45,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
46,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
47,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
48,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
49,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
50,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
51,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
52,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
53,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
54,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
55,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
56,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
57,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
58,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
59,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped.

79,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
80,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
81,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
82,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
83,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
84,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
85,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
86,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
87,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
88,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
89,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
90,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
91,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
92,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
93,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
94,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
95,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
96,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
97,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
98,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have.

118,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
119,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
120,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
121,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
122,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
123,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
124,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
125,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
126,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
127,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
128,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
129,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
130,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
131,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
132,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
133,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
134,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
135,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
136,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
137,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."

Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
158,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
159,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
160,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
161,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
162,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
163,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
164,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
165,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
166,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
167,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
168,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
169,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
170,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
171,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
172,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
173,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
174,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
175,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
176,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
177,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened.

Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
197,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
198,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
199,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
200,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
201,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
202,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
203,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
204,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
205,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
206,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
207,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
208,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
209,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
210,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
211,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
212,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
213,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
214,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
215,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
216,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan.

Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
237,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
238,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
239,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
240,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
241,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
242,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
243,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
244,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
245,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
246,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
247,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
248,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
249,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
250,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
251,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
252,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
253,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
254,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
255,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
256,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees.

276,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
277,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
278,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
279,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
280,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
281,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
282,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
283,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
284,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
285,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
286,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
287,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
288,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
289,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
290,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
291,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
292,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
293,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
294,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
295,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."

If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
315,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
316,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
317,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
318,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
319,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
320,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
321,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
322,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
323,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
324,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
325,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
326,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
327,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
328,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
329,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
330,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
331,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
332,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
333,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
334,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries).

For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
355,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
356,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
357,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
358,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
359,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
360,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
361,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
362,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
363,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
364,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
365,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
366,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
367,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
368,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
369,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
370,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
371,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
372,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
373,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
374,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll).

There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
395,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
396,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
397,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
398,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
399,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
400,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
401,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
402,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
403,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
404,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
405,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
406,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
407,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
408,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
409,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
410,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
411,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
412,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
413,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."

Mmmmm."
433,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
434,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
435,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
436,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
437,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
438,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
439,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
440,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
441,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
442,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
443,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
444,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
445,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
446,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
447,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
448,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
449,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
450,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
451,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
452,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3.

472,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
473,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
474,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
475,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
476,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
477,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
478,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
479,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
480,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
481,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
482,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
483,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
484,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
485,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
486,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
487,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
488,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
489,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
490,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
491,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."

511,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
512,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
513,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
514,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
515,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
516,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
517,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
518,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
519,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
520,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
521,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
522,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
523,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
524,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
525,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
526,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
527,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
528,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
529,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
530,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"

Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
551,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
552,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
553,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
554,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
555,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
556,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
557,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
558,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
559,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
560,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
561,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
562,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
563,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
564,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
565,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
566,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
567,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
568,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."

588,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
589,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
590,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
591,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
592,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
593,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
594,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
595,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
596,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
597,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
598,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
599,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
600,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
601,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
602,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
603,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
604,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
605,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
606,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
607,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."

626,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
627,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
628,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
629,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
630,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
631,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
632,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
633,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
634,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
635,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
636,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
637,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
638,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
639,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
640,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
641,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
642,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
643,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
644,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
645,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive.

We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
665,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
666,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
667,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
668,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
669,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
670,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
671,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
672,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
673,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
674,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
675,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
676,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
677,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
678,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
679,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
680,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
681,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
682,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
683,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"

The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
704,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
705,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
706,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
707,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
708,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
709,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
710,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
711,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
712,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
713,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
714,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
715,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
716,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
717,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
718,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
719,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
720,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
721,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
722,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."

And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
743,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
744,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
745,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
746,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
747,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
748,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
749,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
750,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
751,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
752,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
753,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
754,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
755,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
756,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
757,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
758,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
759,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
760,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
761,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
762,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype.

Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
782,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
783,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
784,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
785,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
786,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
787,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
788,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
789,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
790,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
791,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
792,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
793,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
794,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
795,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
796,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
797,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
798,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
799,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
800,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
801,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again.

I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
821,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
822,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
823,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
824,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
825,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
826,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
827,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
828,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
829,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
830,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
831,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
832,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
833,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
834,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
835,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
836,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
837,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
838,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
839,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
840,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time.

My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
861,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
862,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
863,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
864,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
865,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
866,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
867,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
868,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
869,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
870,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
871,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
872,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
873,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
874,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
875,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
876,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
877,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
878,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
879,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.

The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
900,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
901,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
902,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
903,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
904,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
905,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
906,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
907,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
908,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
909,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
910,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
911,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
912,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
913,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
914,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
915,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
916,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
917,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
918,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"

The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
939,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
940,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
941,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
942,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
943,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
944,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
945,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
946,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
947,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
948,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
949,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
950,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
951,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
952,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
953,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
954,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
955,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
956,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
957,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."

I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
978,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
979,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
980,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
981,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
982,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
983,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
984,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
985,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
986,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
987,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
988,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
989,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
990,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
991,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
992,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
993,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
994,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
995,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
996,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
997,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't.

Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1017,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1018,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1019,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1020,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1021,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1022,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1023,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1024,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1025,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1026,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1027,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1028,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1029,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1030,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1031,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1032,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1033,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1034,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1035,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1036,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan.

Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1057,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1058,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1059,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1060,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1061,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1062,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1063,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1064,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1065,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1066,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1067,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1068,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1069,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1070,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1071,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1072,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1073,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1074,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1075,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1076,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees.

I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1096,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1097,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1098,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1099,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1100,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1101,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1102,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1103,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1104,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1105,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1106,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1107,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1108,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1109,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1110,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1111,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1112,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1113,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1114,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1115,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes.

I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1135,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1136,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1137,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1138,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1139,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1140,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1141,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1142,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1143,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1144,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1145,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1146,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1147,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1148,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1149,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1150,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1151,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1152,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1153,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1154,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly.

I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1175,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1176,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1177,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1178,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1179,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1180,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1181,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1182,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1183,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1184,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1185,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1186,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1187,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1188,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1189,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1190,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1191,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1192,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1193,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1194,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity).

1213,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1214,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1215,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1216,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1217,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1218,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1219,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1220,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1221,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1222,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1223,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1224,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1225,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1226,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1227,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1228,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1229,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1230,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1231,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1232,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door.

Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1253,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1254,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1255,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1256,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1257,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1258,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1259,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1260,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1261,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1262,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1263,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1264,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1265,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1266,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1267,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1268,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1269,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1270,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1271,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."

1291,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1292,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1293,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1294,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1295,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1296,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1297,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1298,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1299,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1300,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1301,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1302,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1303,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1304,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1305,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1306,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1307,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1308,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1309,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1310,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"

1330,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1331,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1332,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1333,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1334,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1335,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1336,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1337,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1338,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1339,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1340,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1341,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1342,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1343,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1344,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1345,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1346,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1347,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1348,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."

Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1368,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1369,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1370,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1371,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1372,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1373,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1374,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1375,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1376,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1377,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1378,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1379,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1380,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1381,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1382,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1383,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1384,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1385,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."

A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1405,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1406,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1407,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1408,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1409,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1410,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1411,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1412,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1413,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1414,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1415,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1416,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1417,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1418,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1419,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1420,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1421,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1422,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1423,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1424,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones.

The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1444,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1445,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1446,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1447,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1448,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1449,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1450,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1451,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1452,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1453,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1454,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1455,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1456,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1457,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1458,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1459,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1460,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1461,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1462,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."

And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1483,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1484,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1485,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1486,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1487,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1488,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1489,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1490,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1491,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1492,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1493,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1494,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1495,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1496,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1497,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1498,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1499,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1500,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1501,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1502,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either.

""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1522,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1523,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1524,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1525,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1526,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1527,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1528,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1529,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1530,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1531,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1532,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1533,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1534,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1535,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1536,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1537,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1538,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1539,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1540,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1541,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small.

The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1561,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1562,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1563,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1564,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1565,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1566,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1567,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1568,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1569,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1570,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1571,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1572,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1573,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1574,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1575,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1576,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1577,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1578,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1579,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1580,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest.

1600,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1601,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1602,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1603,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1604,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1605,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1606,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1607,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1608,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1609,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1610,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1611,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1612,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1613,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1614,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1615,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1616,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1617,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1618,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1619,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.

Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1639,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1640,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1641,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1642,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1643,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1644,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1645,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1646,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1647,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1648,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1649,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1650,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1651,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1652,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1653,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1654,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1655,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1656,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1657,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1658,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty!

I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1678,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1679,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1680,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1681,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1682,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1683,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1684,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1685,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1686,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1687,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1688,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1689,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1690,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1691,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1692,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1693,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1694,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1695,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1696,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1697,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions.

1717,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1718,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1719,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1720,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1721,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1722,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1723,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1724,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1725,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1726,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1727,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1728,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1729,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1730,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1731,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1732,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1733,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1734,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1735,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1736,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan.

Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1757,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1758,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1759,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1760,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1761,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1762,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1763,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1764,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1765,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1766,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1767,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1768,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1769,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1770,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1771,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1772,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1773,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1774,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1775,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1776,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees.

I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1796,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1797,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1798,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1799,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1800,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1801,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1802,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1803,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1804,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1805,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1806,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1807,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1808,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1809,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1810,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1811,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1812,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1813,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1814,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1815,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes.

I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1835,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1836,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1837,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1838,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1839,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1840,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1841,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1842,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1843,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1844,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1845,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1846,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1847,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1848,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1849,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1850,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1851,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1852,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1853,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1854,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries).

I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1875,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1876,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1877,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1878,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1879,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1880,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1881,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1882,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1883,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1884,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1885,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1886,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1887,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1888,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1889,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1890,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1891,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1892,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1893,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1894,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity).

1913,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1914,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1915,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1916,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1917,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1918,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1919,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1920,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1921,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1922,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1923,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1924,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1925,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1926,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1927,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1928,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1929,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1930,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1931,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1932,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door.

Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1953,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1954,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1955,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1956,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1957,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1958,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1959,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
1960,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
1961,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
1962,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
1963,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
1964,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
1965,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
1966,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
1967,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
1968,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
1969,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
1970,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
1971,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."

1991,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1992,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
1993,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
1994,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
1995,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
1996,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
1997,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
1998,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
1999,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2000,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2001,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2002,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2003,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2004,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2005,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2006,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2007,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2008,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2009,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2010,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"

2030,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2031,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2032,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2033,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2034,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2035,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2036,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2037,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2038,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2039,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2040,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2041,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2042,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2043,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2044,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2045,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2046,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2047,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2048,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."

Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2068,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2069,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2070,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2071,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2072,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2073,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2074,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2075,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2076,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2077,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2078,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2079,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2080,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2081,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2082,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2083,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2084,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2085,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."

A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2105,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2106,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2107,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2108,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2109,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2110,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2111,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2112,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2113,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2114,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2115,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2116,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2117,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2118,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2119,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2120,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2121,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2122,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2123,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2124,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones.

The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2144,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2145,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2146,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2147,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2148,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2149,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2150,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2151,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2152,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2153,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2154,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2155,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2156,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2157,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2158,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2159,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2160,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2161,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2162,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."

And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2183,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2184,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2185,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2186,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2187,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2188,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2189,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2190,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2191,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2192,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2193,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2194,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2195,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2196,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2197,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2198,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2199,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2200,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2201,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2202,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either.

""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2222,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2223,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2224,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2225,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2226,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2227,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2228,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2229,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2230,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2231,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2232,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2233,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2234,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2235,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2236,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2237,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2238,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2239,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2240,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2241,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright.

The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2261,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2262,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2263,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2264,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2265,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2266,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2267,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2268,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2269,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2270,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2271,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2272,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2273,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2274,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2275,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2276,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2277,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2278,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2279,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2280,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest.

2300,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2301,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2302,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2303,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2304,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2305,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2306,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2307,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2308,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2309,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2310,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2311,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2312,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2313,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2314,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2315,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2316,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2317,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2318,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2319,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.

Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2339,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2340,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2341,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2342,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2343,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2344,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2345,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2346,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2347,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2348,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2349,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2350,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2351,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2352,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2353,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2354,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2355,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2356,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2357,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2358,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty!

I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2378,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2379,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2380,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2381,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2382,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2383,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2384,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2385,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2386,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2387,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2388,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2389,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2390,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2391,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2392,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2393,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2394,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2395,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2396,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2397,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions.

2417,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2418,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2419,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2420,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2421,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2422,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2423,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2424,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2425,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2426,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2427,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2428,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2429,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2430,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2431,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2432,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2433,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2434,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2435,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2436,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan.

Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2457,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2458,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2459,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2460,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2461,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2462,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2463,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2464,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2465,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2466,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2467,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2468,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2469,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2470,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2471,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2472,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2473,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2474,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2475,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2476,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees.

I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2496,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2497,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2498,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2499,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2500,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2501,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2502,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2503,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2504,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2505,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2506,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2507,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2508,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2509,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2510,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2511,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2512,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2513,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2514,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2515,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes.

I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2535,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2536,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2537,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2538,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2539,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2540,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2541,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2542,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2543,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2544,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2545,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2546,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2547,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2548,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2549,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2550,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2551,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2552,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2553,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2554,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries).

I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2575,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2576,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2577,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2578,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2579,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2580,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2581,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2582,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2583,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2584,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2585,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2586,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2587,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2588,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2589,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2590,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2591,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2592,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2593,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2594,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity).

2613,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2614,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2615,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2616,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2617,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2618,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2619,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2620,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2621,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2622,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2623,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2624,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2625,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2626,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2627,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2628,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2629,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2630,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2631,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2632,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door.

Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2653,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2654,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2655,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2656,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2657,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2658,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2659,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2660,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2661,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2662,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2663,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2664,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2665,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2666,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2667,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2668,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2669,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2670,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2671,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."

2691,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2692,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2693,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2694,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2695,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2696,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2697,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2698,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2699,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2700,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2701,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2702,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2703,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2704,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2705,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2706,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2707,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2708,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2709,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2710,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"

2730,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2731,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2732,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2733,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2734,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2735,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2736,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2737,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2738,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2739,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2740,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2741,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2742,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2743,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2744,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2745,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2746,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2747,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2748,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."

Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2768,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2769,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2770,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2771,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2772,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2773,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2774,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2775,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2776,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2777,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2778,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2779,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2780,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2781,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2782,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2783,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2784,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2785,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."

A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2805,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2806,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2807,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2808,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2809,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2810,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2811,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2812,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2813,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2814,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2815,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2816,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2817,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2818,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2819,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2820,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2821,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2822,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2823,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2824,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones.

The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2844,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2845,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2846,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2847,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2848,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2849,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2850,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2851,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2852,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2853,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2854,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2855,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2856,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2857,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2858,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2859,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2860,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2861,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2862,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."

And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2883,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2884,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2885,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2886,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2887,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2888,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2889,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2890,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2891,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2892,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2893,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2894,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2895,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2896,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2897,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2898,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2899,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
2900,"My brother recommended La Note, so I made a reservation for a 115pm lunch last Thursday. My friend and I were seated right on time at an umbrella-ed table in the corner of the lovely patio as requested.The ambiance at La Note, especially on the patio, was very much like restaurants in and around Nice and throughout Provence. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing, their service was excellent. We never felt rushed to leave, despite the restaurant being full. My friend ordered one of the specials, I had the Salade Nicoise, one of my favorite lunch dishes when in Nice. My friend loved her sandwich. My salad was very good, definitely a generous serving too, but I was a bit disappointed: this was more of a second cousin to a true Salade Nicoise; however, that did not stop me from eating most of it, and taking home the rest. The prices are very reasonable. I brought a bottle of wine, for which there was a corkage fee, as I'd expected, also reasonable. Our lunch was a complete success. We had a great time. I would love to go back for breakfast, which as described on the menu, looks very enticing.I highly recommend La Note. Even though it's 6000 miles from Provence, it's still very close."
2901,"Finally tried this place for brunch! I recommend making reservations through Yelp and going on a weekday to avoid long waits. The aesthetics are cute (including the bathrooms!). Honestly feel like this place is overhyped (and overpriced) though. Our window table was so small. Can't pronounce most things on the menu because it's in French, so I had to point and show the waiter hahahaha. And then when the food came, it was just alright. ""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2902,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either.

""Basic"" would be a good way to describe it tbh, in the most basic sense of the word. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but I don't think I would spend the time or money here again. Just had to check it off my Berkeley bucket list. Also I'm not sure what they mean by surcharge but that was added to our bill for two people, on top of tax. I didn't really read it but I assume it's gratuity/tip?"
2922,"La Note is incredible, and the consistent line out the door is proof of that. Breakfast and lunch here are both delicious, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. Even the basics, like a simple scramble with roasted tomatoes (seriously, order these) and toast, are worth the trip, and their extended list of pancakes and French toast lives up to the hype. You can't go wrong with a full meal or a small snack of a latte and pastry (croissant or coffee cake are my favorites), either. And if you're not much of a coffee fan, their juices are fresh-pressed and delicious!I'd give a 4.5 simply for the inconsistency in service, but with such a busy restaurant, it's easy to see why the staff might be stretched thin. For a delightful French flair to your breakfast or lunch, La Note is more than another nice neighborhood cafe - it's a true standout that is worth waiting in line for."
2923,"Cute brunch spot in Berkeley! My parents used to live in Berkeley, as they're both Cal alum, so they were looking for somewhere near campus that we could eat at while we were waiting for my parents' reunion activities to start. Man, there was already a line when we got there, and it hadn't even opened! Thankfully, we got there early enough to get a table b/c we were one of the first people in line. The inside of the restaurant is fairly spacious to accommodate a good number of patrons, but I can imagine that at later hours, this place would get packed given its proximity to a college campus. I got their lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears. Warm and a little spicy, but contrasted with the bright notes of the pears and lemon with the sweet berry compote. Highly recommend! Next time I'm in the Bay Area, i'll be coming back here for sure!"
2924,"Lovely and very popular breakfast spot, reminiscent of being in Southern France. The service is friendly and the food is quintessentially French country. We had the gruyere and jamon omelette with sourdough toast, and poached eggs with whole grain toast. Tip: go with the French specials! That's what makes this place. This includes the specialty coffees.Hard not to have an absolutely lovely morning here over brunch with your loved ones. A little on the pricey side, but by the size of the crowds - apparently it's worth."
2925,"Came here for brunch with a friend. We had to wait a bit for a table, but it was well worth the wait. The service was amazing - super friendly, funny and attentive. The food was just delicious - super good. We also had a really good mimosa. I would definitely come back here, would be interested in trying a meal other than breakfast. Love this place."
2926,"Wowsers!After years of having La Note bookmarked for forever & having walked away on more than 1 occasion because, I don't do lines.....the fates finally smiled upon us when I was able to score a weekday reservation for brunchSeated on the back patio in an awesome corner w/ lots of lovely trees & flowers surrounding us, the feast could beginWe indulged in the assorted breads w/ homemade jam - way too delish!The Cinnamon Brioche w/ lavender honey - eye rolls!Mr & I chose the cheese omelette w/ potatoes & whole cloves of garlic & again, eye rolls!  The omelettes were perfectly fluffy and there was a perfect ratio of bloopy-gloopy cheese.  Props!BFF got the goat cheese ravioli with walnuts & grapes in a gorgonzola sauce & inhaled his dish while all the while proclaiming how awesome it wasMom got the Salmon Sandwich & it was huge, fresh & she loved the side saladSis got the goat cheese scramble with roasted tomatoes & was blown away - tons of goat cheese to make for a very creamy-eggy dishAnd you might think we were too full for dessert but if you did, then you don't know us at all.....We got their daily specials of Vanilla-lavender Creme Brulee & it was light & creamy & had a ever-so-slight hint of lavenderAlso got their Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding - this was the only non-amazing dish.  The bread pudding was not nearly custardy enough to be considered a bread pudding.  it was more like a soft croissant served with sauce..... but it was flavorfulSo a huge 5-Stars for a well-warranted, well worth the wait adventure to La Note.  Salut!!"
2927,"My friend and I randomly came across this cute little place in downtown Berkeley while walking, so decided to give a try. We were led through a small walkway and entered the backyard. Nothing could be better than a cosy brunch under the sunshine!We both opted for the pancake and scrambled egg combo - the blueberry pancake was fluffy and huge in size, delicious! Love to come back and try more options."
2928,"Love brunch at La Note. Lots of of my friends love their pancakes, but my favorites are their latte and omelette with grilled tomatoes on the side. Simple but delicious. There is always a line during brunch time so if you don't wait for too long, I recommend you going right when they are open.I have also tried dinner there but I don't think it's as impressive as their brunch. There are much better French places for dinner in the city."
2929,"Awesome French restaurant! Had the best time w my friend Julia today for brunch. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but it was well worth it! I love this place and that it's a cute little spot in Berkeley. Definitely coming back w my boyfriend sooner than later! Love love love!"
2930,"Excellent brunch today! We got here around 12:30 pm and there was a huge line outside. Mostly large groups joining for Sunday brunch. Fortunately for us we were a party of two and were sat promptly. We also got to sit outside which was perfect because we wanted the sun to shine on our faces as we nibble away. We ordered the Lucas eggs with salad instead of toast, albacore and Tuna steak salad, double stack pumpkin and ginger pancakes topped with blueberries and fresh pears. To drink we also had their French mojito and Bloody Mary. Before we waited for our breakfast to arrive we nibbled on their almond croissant. Everything was really good. From start to finish in every bite. We felt full afterwards without having the food coma. Can't wait to come back and try more of their delicious food!"
2931,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
2932,"I used to love coming to La Note while I was at Berkeley, but even then I have to admit it was mostly because there was always a line out the door when I tried to get in for brunch and so I always felt like I was missing something if I didn't come to try their brunch menu. Over and over again I've had their food, and everytime I always feel like I still don't get the hype.Things that are objectively good:1. The cote nord. It is delicious and decadent. I definitely prefer to cream cheese over the goat cheese, but that's me.2. The sourdough toast. Order buckets of this.3. The poached pears on the gingerbread pancakes, but give the pancakes a miss. They're dense and mediocre.4. OEUF A LA COQUE - but that's because very few restaurants do them here.Things that are objectively meh1. The breakfast potatoes2. Their scrambles3. Their pancakes.Going to La Note is always a fun little experience because of how cute and quaint everything is, but if you're looking for something that's going to wow you, blow you away and actually be worth the 1h wait, I would actually recommend the warm poached egg salad and Venus next door. Mmmmm."
2933,"Great tiny little restaurant, reminded me of France. Tiny table, tiny water jugs and water cups.Menu is in French w/ english translation. Food was great, very French like, but what do you expect from a French restaurant. Overall 5 star."
2934,"If there's one place I miss the most in Berkeley (since graduating and moving back down to South Bay), it's La Note. I can't tell you how many Sunday brunches I have been to or how many of my friends/family members I have introduced to this wonderful restaurant. :')I am a BIG fan of their Weekend All Day Brunch menu (Saturday and Sunday 8 AM - 3 PM). There are no reservations for brunch so either 1) GO SUPER EARLY, 2) call ahead to ask for the wait time and decide if you still want to go, or 3) GO ANYWAYS and put down your name on the list and walk around for 30-45 minutes while you wait (Pegasus Books, Crossroad Trading Company, UCha, etc. are all within the 5 minute vicinity). Their assorted pastry basket ($10.50) is delicious; it comes with a plain croissant, almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning bun (kinda like a cinnamon roll). I only order this if there are 3-4 people at the table. I love dipping everything in La Note's butter + jam. You can upgrade to the Lavender honey for $1.75! For my main course, I usually switch between the Omelette Au Fromage (cheese and ham omelette with sourdough and homefries) ($13.95) and the Cote Est (two scrambled eggs, one pancake, and homefries) ($14.50). I like the Cote Est because you get to pick any pancake of your choice. My favorite is definitely the Creme Fraiche Pancake. It's not too sweet,and really compliments the salty side of your meal. YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEFRIES WHEN YOU ARE HERE. They are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with garlic and herbs (Rosemary). 10/10 The bill easily racks up, especially since they now add 20% automatically so that all the workers (in the front, in the kitchen) can be paid fairly. I haven't found a brunch place I love more than La Note. *I have also tried their dinner entrees and really enjoyed their Steak Frites Persillade (organic flat iron steak w/ parsley butter and french fries). If you wanted to host special events (like a Student-Professor Dinner), La Note also provides a specialty menu. :)"
2935,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2936,"With my parents last night in town, we had to get French and this was the best rated in the area. Though I saw most of the reviews were for the brunch, the French also know how to make a dinner. So on a warm, early night we hit this up as a party of 5. As we had already consumed A LOT of seafood this week, and a big lunch, we decided to skip the appetizer, go straight for the bottle of wine, and take into consideration the entrees. Now normally my father and I would have gone to town on BOUILLABAISSE MARSEILLAISE (I apologize for the caps, I copied from the menu as I know I'll spell it wrong) but someone in the restaurant did order it, and it looked and smelled great. Around the table my father got a salad, my mother the POULET AU PRUNEAUX, my sister the STEAK FRITES PERSILLADE, my sister's boyfriend the LASAGNE DU JOUR and I went with...FEUILLETE ST JAQUES - So on a menu with bouillabaisse, open-faced sandwiches, a lot of pasta dishes, this was the one item that stood out and so glad I got it. You ready for this? So a puff pastry filled with seafood. Yeah, that's a thing. I love flaky pastries and pies of all kind, and I love shrimp, scallops, and salmon so how could I not order this. And it was delicious. Actually I kind of want it right now...So great food, great service. The place was a bit warm inside and I want to wait for brunch before giving it a full 5 stars, but I'm a fan. Note: One of the best features was the accordion player, playing a mix of 70s, 80s, and even modern hits. I heard Never Gonna Give You Up on accordion. My life in complete."
2937,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
2938,"Quaint little French eatery with rustic vibes. Came for brunch around 1:30, wait time about 30min. Seated and started eating about 30min later. The place seems pretty popular, always a wait time from what a friend told me, but you can call ahead to reserve a table to avoid it. The staff was friendly and pretty efficient. Food was tasty! They nail the authentic French-style cooked eggs. Not a lot of variety of French-style dishes, but decent selection within the ones they have. Only downside is the place is pretty cramped, but its to be expected bc of its location. Would totally recommend it to a friend!"
2939,Parking sucks so go first thing in the morning and you'll be ok. This place is pretty popular so there's a  line before they open. This place is really small and a little cramped. The tables are a little small so it's hard to eat because you don't want anything to spill. The good was pretty good but my eggs were a runny. I think this is how french eggs are made but I prefer mine well done. The service was a little slow pace. I gave it a 4 star because the french toast was good minus the eggs. I would return because it's one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.i would definitely recommend everyone try because food is based on opinion.
