0,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
1,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
2,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
3,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
4,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
5,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
6,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
7,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
8,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
9,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
10,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
11,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
12,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
13,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
14,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
15,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
16,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
17,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
18,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
19,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."

84,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
85,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
86,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
87,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
88,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
89,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
90,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
91,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
92,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
93,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
94,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
95,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
96,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
97,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
98,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
99,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
100,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
101,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
102,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
103,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful.

I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
167,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
168,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
169,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
170,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
171,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
172,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
173,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
174,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
175,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
176,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
177,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
178,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
179,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
180,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
181,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
182,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
183,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
184,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
185,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about.

250,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
251,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
252,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
253,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
254,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
255,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
256,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
257,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
258,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
259,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
260,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
261,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
262,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
263,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
264,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
265,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
266,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
267,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
268,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
269,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to.

332,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
333,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
334,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
335,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
336,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
337,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
338,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
339,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
340,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
341,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
342,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
343,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
344,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
345,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
346,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
347,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
348,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
349,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
350,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.

I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
415,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
416,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
417,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
418,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
419,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
420,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
421,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
422,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
423,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
424,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
425,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
426,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
427,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
428,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
429,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
430,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
431,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
432,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."

497,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
498,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
499,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
500,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
501,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
502,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
503,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
504,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
505,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
506,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
507,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
508,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
509,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
510,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
511,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
512,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
513,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
514,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
515,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!

579,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
580,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
581,"There are many things to love about this place! We had burritos and plantains. Summary: - The pico de gallo (mild salsa) was too spicy for me- CILANTRO ALERT: They put cilantro in all the salsas and in the guacamole. If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
582,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
583,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
584,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
585,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
586,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
587,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
588,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
589,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
590,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
591,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
592,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
593,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
594,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
595,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
596,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
597,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!

If you hate it, no salsa or guac for you.- The plantains were dry and not tasty- The ladies bathroom is faaabulous :) and the atmosphere / interior overall is great"
662,"Excellent Excellent Excellent... From The Carne Azada Plate, Enchiladas Verdes, tacos de Chorizo, Burrito de Mole and OMG Pupusas... wow..  This is my second time here and will be back soon.  Everything is fresh and great services.. I will now get back to eating .. Enjoy folks!!"
663,"2nd time here and I know this is a favorite!This place is consistently good. I cannot emphasise enough on the good quality meat and amazing food options here.This time, between the four of us we shared:- pollo asado burrito- carne asada burrito with spicy sauce and everything on it- chicken poblano mole- 2 tamales (chicken and veg)- flan dessertCarne asada burrito remains a favorite mainly due to the great quality meat. Beautifully smoked flavor without being tough or chewy and great sized chunks.Tamales are really big and flavorful. Their veg is our favorite from chicken (a little too dry) and pork.Chicken Poblano was amazing with a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy and rich.We ended it strong by sharing flan which was great.Can't recommend this place enough. Oh, and they serve organic eggs for their breakfast items :)"
664,"I cannot get enough of Casa Latina!!! Their nachos aren't just my favorite nachos in the east bay, they're probably my favorite nachos of all time. The chips are homemade, they're so flavorful. They're topped with melted cheese, fresca cheese, whole beans, jalapeños, sour cream, omg. Their carnitas are juicy and perfectly spiced. Adding guac is well worth it. I'm totally in love with the nachos. The ambiance in here is totally beautiful and calm. They have a full bakery and everything looks delicious."
665,"You seriously have to try their papusas!! I've been coming to this restaurant for over a year and it's always an amazing experience.   Everything on the menu is authentic and delicious, but the papusas are a definite highlight for me.   This restaurant is also pretty quirky with their obsession with Frida Kahlo, but that just adds to its charm and gives people something to talk about. Be sure to grab some sweet treats from their panaderia on your way out!!"
666,"Went to this restaurant today with my husband because we we're craving Mexican food and we really enjoyed it! Customer service was great. The food was delicious! I think what made it even better was the quality of the meat, we ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada nachos. Not only was the meat tasty and tender but everything else tasted so fresh. We also really enjoyed the salsas they gave us, the green one was our fav. We hope to visit this spot again and try their pastries next time."
667,This is just for the panaderia...came with my folks to get some sweet treats xx We were greeted as soon as we walked in and there were two cases of beautiful looking pastries x We bought a dozen pastries for $16:-)) Next time I'm coming for the tacos and mole.
668,The mole and fish tacos were amazing. This is my new fav Mexican spot in the east bay. Also I love the Frida decor and service. Will be back!!!
669,"The portions were sizable and the quality of the food was excellent across the board. I got the fajitas. Tortillas were definitely made in house, the beef was full on strips of steak cooked to medium well, the avocado was ripe, the salsa was very fresh, etc. I'd say it's one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I can't eat pastries, but they also offer fresh pastries from a bakery that shares the space. Check it out!"
670,This place is on a busy street but we're lucky to find parking. This place is super cute. They sell fresh Mexican bread if you just want some to go. A lot of options. They also have a lot of aguas frescas. They even had sangria with fresh fruit. My favorite thing there was Fresh carrot juice and fresh orange juice. I love anything that is healthy but by far it's my favorite thing. It was a little on the expensive side but it is high quality so it definitely is worth it. Very nicely decorated inside. The other half is a restaurant with a lot of art. Really well thought out restaurant we'll definitely be returning.
671,So happy we came to this place after our run club. The place not only has a cool vibe and TONS of Frida Kahlo... but the food is sooo good!I had a Barbacoa burrito and we also ordered a pupusa platter.Did not disappoint.Not to mention the bakery!!!!!!!! Looks so good
672,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
673,"Always fresh, tasty, and well-balanced!  And great value."
674,"Delicious tacos and really great, service. I had no idea this restaurant/ Frida Kahlo art gallery (for real, check it out--painting of Frida) existed until a few months ago. I've been back twice since. The vibe is very family friendly and with a bakery on the premises you can have your cake (and fresh Mexican breads) and eat your tacos too. There's plenty of seating and self-serve utensils and napkins. It's just a low-key eatery with authentic Mexican cuisine, including aguas frescas and beer. I can see it getting really busy during the summer due to its airiness and beer. Yes, cervezas for all!"
675,Absolutely loved this cute little joint. Love the set-up of the place with Frida Kahlo's art everywhere. Makes it feel very homey and welcoming. We had brunch and also tried their breads. The food was very delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again when I'm in the Berkeley area. You have to go check it out too!
676,"The best Mexican bakery in Berkeley. Get their conchas.. you won't regret it.I got two pastries and a small coffee, total cost was ~$6.Super friendly staff, amazing pastries, and coffee is comparable to Starbucks/Peets."
677,This place has amazing burritos!!! Huge and packed full of great tasting ingredients. And as a bonus they have a awesome bakery there too!! Grab a slab of chocolate cake for dessert!!
678,"Omg..!!  I love the atmosphere here.   Exactly what I wanted to walk into.  A Latin music playing cafe.   Almost felt at home if they had a couch and tv.. lol.  Red chilaquiles were as the nice lady said SPICY..  the cookie was just as I remember in Texas but not so much the barbacoa taco...  now the reason for my lack of 5 stars was the price and the taco..  price was a little high $21 and the taco wasn't what I was looking for, TEXAS BARBACOA where are you..!???   If I'm in Berkeley again I will come by...  thank you. You just dropped to 3 stars...  who doesn't give free refills on coffee?  And to charge $1.99 for another cup?!?!?   How am I supposed to enjoy my cookie now? I'm very sad now.."
679,"Had the chicken Verde enchiladas and they were the best I've had on years. Moderately spicy Verde sauce, white meat tender chicken and great tortillas. Highly recommend and I rarely write reviews."
680,Holy wow. This place is amazing. Pupsa - A+ / Al Pastor Burrito- A+ / kids been & cheese burrito- A+   Extremely reasonable
