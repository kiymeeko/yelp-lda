1,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
2,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
3,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
4,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
5,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
6,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
7,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
8,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
9,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
10,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
11,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
12,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"
13,"Favorite menu items...Lunch/Dinner: hummus, chicken/meat kabobs, and wash down with mint tea.Dessert: baklava (a MUST)! Brunch/Breakfast: Armenian oatmeal (just ask), spinach/feta roll, Mezza brunch ($15 per person it's a lot of food), mushroom quiche (yum)! It's a nice restaurant overall. Outdoor and indoor seating available. Outdoor seating is partially covered. Light music player indoors. Friendly staff. Average $30-40 tab for two. Metered street parking available. You can park for free after 6pm, including the yellow zone curb. Cheers!"
14,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
15,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
16,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."
17,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
18,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
19,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."

For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

54,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
55,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
56,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."
57,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food.

Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"

59,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad.

61,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
62,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
63,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
64,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out.

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
65,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
66,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
67,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
68,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
69,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
70,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
71,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"

Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
107,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
108,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
109,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
110,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
111,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
112,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine.

All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich.

114,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.

117,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs.

Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
118,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
119,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."
120,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
121,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
122,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
123,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
124,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
125,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."

The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
158,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
159,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."

161,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
162,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
163,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
164,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
165,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
166,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
167,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."

Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
169,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
170,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
171,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
172,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"
173,"Favorite menu items...Lunch/Dinner: hummus, chicken/meat kabobs, and wash down with mint tea.Dessert: baklava (a MUST)! Brunch/Breakfast: Armenian oatmeal (just ask), spinach/feta roll, Mezza brunch ($15 per person it's a lot of food), mushroom quiche (yum)! It's a nice restaurant overall. Outdoor and indoor seating available. Outdoor seating is partially covered. Light music player indoors. Friendly staff. Average $30-40 tab for two. Metered street parking available. You can park for free after 6pm, including the yellow zone curb. Cheers!"
174,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
175,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
176,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."

211,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
212,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

214,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
215,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
216,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town.

217,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
218,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
219,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."

221,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
222,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
223,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
224,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
225,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
226,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
227,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
228,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
229,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."

I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
265,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
266,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
267,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
268,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
269,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
270,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
271,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"

All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor.

275,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
276,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."
277,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
278,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
279,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."
280,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
281,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
282,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"

315,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
316,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town.

317,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
318,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
319,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."
320,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
321,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
322,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
323,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
324,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
325,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
326,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
327,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
328,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
329,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
330,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
331,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
332,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

368,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
369,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
370,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
371,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
372,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely.

All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich.

374,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.

379,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad.

380,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
381,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
382,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
383,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
384,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
385,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
386,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
387,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time.

421,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
422,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
423,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
424,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
425,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
426,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
427,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
428,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
429,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
430,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
431,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
432,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

You can park for free after 6pm, including the yellow zone curb. Cheers!"
434,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
435,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
436,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."
437,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"

All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

474,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
475,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
476,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."

The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes.

479,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad.

It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead.

I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
485,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
486,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
487,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
488,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
489,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
490,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
491,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"

525,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
526,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
527,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
528,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
529,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
530,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
531,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"

All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor.

537,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
538,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
539,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."
540,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
541,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
542,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
543,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
544,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out.

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry.

578,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
579,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad.

581,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead.

As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."

586,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips..

587,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays.

I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time.

The food is alright, but I like the variety."
589,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
590,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
591,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
592,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

594,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.

596,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here.

629,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
630,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
631,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
632,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich.

Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
642,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
643,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
644,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
645,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
646,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
647,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."

I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
682,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
683,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
684,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
685,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
686,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
687,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
688,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
689,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
690,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
691,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
692,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine.

All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"
693,"Favorite menu items...Lunch/Dinner: hummus, chicken/meat kabobs, and wash down with mint tea.Dessert: baklava (a MUST)!

Outdoor and indoor seating available. Outdoor seating is partially covered. Light music player indoors. Friendly staff. Average $30-40 tab for two. Metered street parking available. You can park for free after 6pm, including the yellow zone curb. Cheers!"
694,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
695,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
696,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."
697,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
698,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
699,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."

734,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.

736,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town.

It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
738,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
739,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad.

741,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
742,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
745,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
746,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
747,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
748,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
749,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
750,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
751,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"

The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor.

787,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
788,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
789,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
790,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
791,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
792,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine.

All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich.

798,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
799,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."
800,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
801,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
802,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
803,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
804,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
805,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
806,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread.

Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
838,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
839,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."
840,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
841,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
842,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
843,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
844,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
845,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
846,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
847,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
848,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
849,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
850,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
851,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
852,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

You can park for free after 6pm, including the yellow zone curb. Cheers!"
854,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.
855,"Ordered 2 beef kabobs, received one. Not sure how fresh the beef was.My coworker ordered soup, there was a hair in it..."
856,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."
857,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs.

I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes.

I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
892,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

894,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.

896,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency.

I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes.

It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"

901,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
902,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
903,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
904,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
905,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
906,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
907,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
908,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
909,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
910,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be.

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
945,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
946,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
947,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
948,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
949,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
950,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
951,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"

The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate.

956,"For decades, the hallmark of this place was its consistency. The menu never ever changed, but you could absolutely count on the meal being cooked consistently well--the meats well-spiced and perfectly cooked. But for the first time ever, tonight, the pomegranate chicken was overcooked, the lentil soup was short on lentils, and the whole wheat pita was inedibly stale. I'm stunned that this happened here. I can only hope that they had some emergency requiring a substitute chef for the evening. Even the service was unusually inattentive. Did this place change owners, or is it just the B Team since the students are on summer break?  I'm very much hoping that tonight was a fluke and that everything will be back to normal the next time we're in town. This place is too venerable an icon, has been too delicious too long, to slip like this."
957,"SERVICE: Family-owned, I think? Our server was super nice and patient and was very attentive to our needs. I think my friend had her water refilled around 4 times throughout dinner...FOOD: Definitely recommend the Pomegranate Chicken. The chicken was moist and well marinated. I couldn't quite taste pomegranate, so the best way to describe the flavor would be initially a bit sweet and sour (maybe that's the pomegranate?) but aftertaste was definitely savory. The rice they serve has raisins in it, so if you're not into that, BE WARNED. I just picked mine out haha. My friend had the Vegetarian Middle Eastern Plate, which is good if you want to sample their dishes. Servings for both were more than generous; my friend and I both were struggling to finish our food. The dishes offered here are a bit more... flavor heavy than other places that just serve kebabs or falafel. ATMOSPHERE: It's a seat yourself restaurant, so don't stand at the host stand awkwardly for five minutes like I did. You can choose to sit inside or outside, and both options are nice. Inside is more of an intimate setting and has cute decorations, but outside has better ventilation. It's situated in Elmwood, so it's a nice place to get away from the hubbub of Berkeley.Pretty safe Mediterranean restaurant to bring friends with conservative palates. Also a great place to bring your vegetarian friends because they have a pretty comprehensive vegetarian menu. A little pricy, but I would definitely come back again!"
958,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
959,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."

961,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
962,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"

1001,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
1002,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"

1004,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
1005,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
1006,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
1007,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad. It also included pita bread and hummus! What a treat-- all under $15!!!! So glad that I have this place to go to when I'm feeling in the mood for some tasty Mediterranean goodness."
1008,"We kept passing by this place as we walked through Berkeley and I kept saying how cute it was. We ended up staying around for dinner and decided to check this place out. We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
1009,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
1010,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
1011,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
1012,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

We got the Middle Eastern plate which I love because I love sampling different things and this dish allows you to do that. It came with chicken cilica, Grecian spinach & feta sandwich, lamb lule, lemon chicken soup. The lemon chicken soup is delicious. I'm glad I chose that over the potato options. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing really stood out as a favorite. We also got the pomegranate chicken and that was really good with moist and tender pieces of chicken and good flavor.Overall, it was a cute place and we were lucky to have a nice day so we could sit on the patio. The food is alright, but I like the variety."
1049,"My boyfriend and I love this place.The restaurant itself has a lot of charm and makes me feel like I am dining at a local spot in Greece.My favorites from the place is actually the fillo combo, the middle eastern plate, and the lamb kabob! The fillos are all wonderful, my favorite is the Griecan spinach and feta fillo, its crunchy/nutty/sweet/savory/everything you want. Lamb kabob is seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the pomegranate chicken that everyone else loves so much. The seasoning is too sour for my taste.They also have a selection of Greek wine and beer. Great place for groups and families.Would definitely recommend you give this place a visit if you are in Berkeley/Oakland."
1050,"It's been a couple years since my wife and visited one of our favorite go to places when we lived in Temescal. Pomegranate Chicken and Lemon Chicken soup were our favorites but this time everything was bland, over cooked and not full of flavor as it use to be. It was disappointing to see the quality decline and the prices go up. We hope this will change but for now no plans to return. I guess times are changing."
1051,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. They have great authentic Mediterranean food. I love their humus as it's very smooth and flavorful, and their dishes are great. I got some type of chicken skewer and will go back every time I'm in the area. Pretty reasonable prices as well for the amount of food that you get! I always walk out very full. The meal comes with hummus and a salad which is nice so you don't have to order it on the side. They have a gluten free menu, and I have yet to get sick eating here. They are very willing to accommodate as well - I asked for extra vegetables with my hummus appetizer instead of pita bread and they were happy to do so. They provided quite a bit too!"
1052,"Food: 3/5      Price:5/5      Service:4/5      Ambience:5/5Beautiful lunch spot at Elmwood serving authentic Mediterranean cuisine. There is an outdoor seating area which is relaxing, beautiful, and lovely. Indoor is also well decorated and looks comfortable too.  Lunch specials are a great deal, around $11-13 you get a plate with lots of variations of food. All lunch are served with choice of soup or salad. Lunch plates also includes hummus and some fruit slices. There are complimentary flatbread for the table, great for dipping the hummus! The bread was pretty dry though, not like pita.  After much yelping, I went with the most popular Chicken Pomegranate and Middle Eastern plate. Chicken Pomegranate was a few tender drumsticks with yellow rice. I thought the chicken was quite acidic and I didn't particularly liked the flavor. For the side I chose lemon chicken soup, it was kind of weird and I didn't like it either. Small Middle Eastern Plate was much better, although the portion was significantly smaller. It includes 3 small samplers - chicken cilicia (fillo with cinnamon sweet chicken shred), Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich (feta pin wheel). They were all pretty great, I liked Levant sandwich the most. Favorites:* Small Middle Eastern Plate ($10.99) - chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta fillo, Levant sandwich. Others:* Chicken Pomegranate ($10.99) - 3 drumsticks marinated in pomegranate sauce and baked with wild herbs, served over rice.  * sides - lemon chicken soup"

1054,Good quality greek Mediterranean dishes with nice staff. They can get busy but all in all worth the trip. Good quality food and worth the price in my opinion. Nicely packed and great environment.

1058,This place is so cute and the food is amazing. The chicken kebab plate is my go to. I love their hummus and soup. It's a little pricey though
1059,"I've been here 5 years ago, but don't remember much about that experience. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. I ordered the cold cucumber and yogurt soup with a simple salad. My friend ordered the filet mignon with a tangy chicken soup. I enjoyed my refreshing soup and my friend's tangy soup. I thought the filet mignon could've been more tender. The customer service was average."
1060,The food was diverse and very good on the pallet. Tried a bit of everything. Hung out on the front porch and ateEnjoyed the coffee especially!
1061,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with 4 other friends. We wanted to try new and more diverse foods, and we definitely got that from La Mediterranee. Unfortunately, it wasn't as enjoyable an experience as we had expected.I got the vegetarian middle eastern plate (around $15). It wasn't anything too special. It included fruits, a grain dish, and several pastry foods. Definitely not enough to fill me, and definitely not worth the money. The food itself was somewhat tasty, but you're pretty much guaranteed to not like at least 1 out of the 4 pastries. No food really stood out on the veggie plate as I was unsure which food was supposed to be the 'main' dish and which were supposed to be the 'supporting' side foods. The tastes ended up blending together.It was a cool experience overall, but not likely one I'll repeat. I'll be looking for better Mediterranean restaurants around Berkeley instead. I always recommend going places and trying out the food, and La Med is no different -- I think my non-veg friends liked their plates more than I liked mine (and their plates had more food too)."
1062,"Don't order delivery.  They screwed up and gave us a meat combination plate instead of vegetarian. No way to tell from the outside.  We found out only after eating beef in the filo rolls.You had one job to do, La Med - don't make vegetarians eat meat!  Get it right!"
1063,"Came here for brunch recently with a friend, my first time and we sat out in the front patio and it was very relaxing and pleasant, perfect weather that day.  We ordered the steamed eggs with bacon and Mamounia comes with it.  Delicious!"
1064,"We were wandering the street of Berkeley for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. This quirky and cute spot caught my eye and we decided to try it out. I ordered the Soup de Jour in a bowl and Salad ($10.75) while he ordered the Egg Fillo ($10.75). To say the least, we were both disappointed. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but we struggled to even eat our food. My soup was this sour chicken noodle base, which I was only able to drink a couple spoonful before giving up. As for the salad, it was very colorful and the cheese and dressing helped me finish half my plate at least. As a warning if you've never had egg fillo before, it's very dry. I don't know if that's how it's meant to be, but it was not good and food was barely touched.At least to end, we had a free, small piece of baklava, which was pretty good. Otherwise, I'm definitely passing on Mediterranean food next time."
1065,"I have known about this restaurant for years and have wanted to try it.  I went the other night with my friend who also loves middle eastern food.  We both got the chicken kabob and shared the appetizer with humus, babaganush and tubule.  The food was good, not as good as I was expecting however.  The pita bread was hard and stale, like they had reheated old bread in the microwave.  It was fairly noisy and the service was OK.That said, if I was in the Berkeley area and wanted to have middle eastern food again, I probably would return, but would not take a trip from far away to go to this restaurant."
1066,"Bomb Mediterranean food. I got the 1. Chicken kebab plate ($15.50): two skewers of marinated chicken served or rice pilaf and comes with hummus and pita bread. Also comes with fruits (orange slice, pineapple slice, and banana slice). This was so good, I basically finished the whole plate. 2. Middle eastern plate ($15.50): combination of chicken cilicia, Grecian spinach and feta, levant sandwich, and lamb lule or chicken pomegranate. My friend got this and he didn't like it as much as my plate.The levant sandwich was funky/unique, tasted a bit cinnamon-y. It was like a pastry with thin chicken strips.. Overall I had a great experience :)"
1067,"Lunch specials are M-F 11-4pm. If you're off on a weekday, this is a whole lot of food for a small price. It's the cost of a movie ticket nowadays. I thought that it was great that I was immediately seated upon arrival. Of course, the torrential rain was working in my favor but there's no raining on this parade! I was determined to have my chicken breast kebab rain or shine. And that I did. It was delicious. With soaked jacket in tow, I was happy to have this alone time. The waitress was prompt in taking my order. And my meal was pretty awesome. I even had some left to go. The lunch special comes with soup, potato salad or salad.
