0,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
1,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
2,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
3,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
4,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
5,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
6,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
7,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
8,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
9,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
10,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
11,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
12,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
13,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
14,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
15,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
16,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
17,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
18,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
19,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"

39,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
40,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
41,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
42,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
43,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
44,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
45,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
46,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
47,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
48,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
49,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
50,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
51,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
52,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
53,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
54,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
55,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
56,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
57,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
58,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."

They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
78,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
79,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
80,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
81,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
82,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
83,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
84,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
85,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
86,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
87,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
88,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
89,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
90,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
91,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
92,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
93,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
94,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
95,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
96,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."

I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
117,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
118,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
119,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
120,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
121,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
122,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
123,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
124,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
125,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
126,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
127,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
128,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
129,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
130,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
131,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
132,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
133,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
134,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
135,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."

155,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
156,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
157,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
158,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
159,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
160,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
161,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
162,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
163,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
164,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
165,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
166,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
167,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
168,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
169,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
170,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
171,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
172,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
173,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
174,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious.

BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
193,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
194,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
195,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
196,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
197,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
198,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
199,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
200,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
201,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
202,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
203,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
204,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
205,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
206,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
207,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
208,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
209,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
210,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
211,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
212,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102.

The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
232,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
233,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
234,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
235,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
236,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
237,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
238,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
239,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
240,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
241,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
242,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
243,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
244,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
245,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
246,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
247,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
248,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
249,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!

We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
269,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
270,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
271,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
272,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
273,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
274,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
275,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
276,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
277,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
278,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
279,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
280,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
281,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
282,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
283,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
284,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
285,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
286,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
287,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
288,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy!

Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
307,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
308,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
309,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
310,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
311,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
312,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
313,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
314,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
315,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
316,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
317,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
318,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
319,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
320,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
321,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
322,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
323,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
324,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
325,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
326,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go.

I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
346,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
347,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
348,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
349,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
350,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
351,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
352,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
353,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
354,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
355,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
356,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
357,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
358,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
359,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
360,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
361,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
362,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
363,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
364,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
365,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know.

It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
385,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
386,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
387,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
388,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
389,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
390,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
391,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
392,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
393,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
394,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
395,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
396,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
397,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
398,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
399,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
400,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
401,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
402,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
403,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
404,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes.

We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
424,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
425,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
426,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
427,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
428,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
429,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
430,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
431,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
432,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
433,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
434,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
435,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
436,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
437,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
438,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
439,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
440,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
441,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
442,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
443,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat!

462,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
463,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
464,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
465,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
466,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
467,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
468,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
469,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
470,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
471,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
472,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
473,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
474,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
475,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
476,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
477,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
478,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
479,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
480,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
481,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu.

From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
501,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
502,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
503,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
504,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
505,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
506,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
507,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
508,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
509,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
510,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
511,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
512,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
513,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
514,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
515,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
516,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
517,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
518,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
519,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"

Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
539,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
540,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
541,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
542,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
543,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
544,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
545,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
546,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
547,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
548,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
549,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
550,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
551,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
552,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
553,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
554,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
555,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
556,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
557,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."

The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
577,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
578,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
579,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
580,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
581,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
582,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
583,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
584,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
585,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
586,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
587,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
588,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
589,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
590,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
591,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
592,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
593,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
594,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
595,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
596,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."

Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
616,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
617,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
618,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
619,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
620,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
621,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
622,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
623,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
624,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
625,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
626,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
627,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
628,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
629,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
630,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
631,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
632,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
633,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
634,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
635,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long.

The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
655,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
656,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
657,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
658,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
659,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
660,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
661,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
662,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
663,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
664,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
665,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
666,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
667,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
668,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
669,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
670,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
671,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
672,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
673,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."

LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
693,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
694,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
695,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
696,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
697,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
698,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
699,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
700,"Finally - authentic Indonesian food! My absolute favorite place to take and recommend to friends when they ask me what Indonesian cuisine is like. From appetizers to entrees to desserts and drinks, the flavors are deep and bright. This is one of those places that you crave at least once a month.My usual order includes: gado-gado (warm vegetable salad with shrimp crackers and peanut sauce), mie goreng (fried noodles - my ABSOLUTE favorite), Teh Botol (boxed tea drink), Rendang (well seasoned and spiced beef dish), Soto Ayam (Indonesian chicken noodle soup), and Nasi Lemak (combo rice plate - order this if you're not super hungry but want variety).The above is good for at least 4-5 people - portions are generous! Friendly customer service as well, but can take a little while to flag a waiter down. Overall, this is a place that I keep coming back to. Terima kasih!"
701,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
702,"Jayakarta is a hopping place, they've been around a while and they stay pretty busy.  The menu is voluminous, and clearly someone had help with it because it is peppered with yelp reviews and punchy little comments about the various dishes.  They feature all the standard items, like Gado Gado and various Nasi Gorengs, plus a few more exotic items (e.g. the grilled bananas with shredded cheddar cheese and chocolate sauce).  They also make a point of differentiating ""American"" spicy from ""Indonesian"" spicy on a 5 point scale...the relegate American tastes to grades 1 and 2 and state that levels 3-5 are only by actual request.  There are little descirptors detailing how ""American"" versus ""Indonesian"" people will respond to the different levels, with the ""Americans"" of course having weaker resistance.   Probably mostly true but not universal, America is a pretty big space and we have a range of spice tolerances.Anyway, enough about that.  My friends had plates featuring a variety of items, vegetables and chicken.  They came out suspiciously fast; like they had just been waiting.  I like fast service but this bordered on too fast.  Despite the suspicion they were pretty good.  I had the oreng oreng, a plate of bean cake, tofu, and string beans in a spicy sauce.  To be cautious I ordered it with spice level 3, and it was definitely spicy.  Not unpleasantly so, but I like super spicy (by I guess my American standards) so your results may vary.  My wife ordered a curry noodle dish that was supposed to have potatoes and other veggies but wound up not having any of the above.  It was still okay but not quite what she had in mind.We finished with the two different banana dessert options.  One was the chocolate cheese and banana concoction and the other was the friend banana with ice cream and sweet gelatin.  Both were okay, not superlative.So what is the verdict?  It's okay.  Not exceptional, but satisfactory.  If you are in the mood for Indonesian it is a fine place to visit."
703,"One of the times Stephanie S. and I dropped off Clay S. and Neil S. in Berkeley, we ended up trying Jayakarta Restaurant. Although you can choose your own spice level, this Indonesian restaurant is well known for their spiciest dishes. I like to enjoy my food, so I just went with the regular spice. Their highest level of spice is the spiciest level you could get in any restaurant in the bay area. Pretty nifty if you're into spicy foods!The Beef Rendang was one of the most popular dishes on Yelp. The sauce is semi-flavorful, but it is definitely pricey at $15 for 4 pieces of meat! We also tried the chow mein, dried yellow noodles (with a small bowl of soup), and fried rice. Everything was just okay, but I did like the spice kick."
704,"This place is great when they aren't overwhelmed with large parties and a full restaurant. When it gets super busy however, the experience is pretty terrible with forgotten orders and terrible service. Overall however, this is a great place to try Indonesian food! They have so many dishes and desserts to choose from it can get pretty overwhelming, but if you like spices and spicy food you are in for a treat! I really appreciate that they have truly spicy food here, it's spicy, but in my opinion it could be spicier. I always get the spiciest food they have and get a mild forehead sweat at the best. Love their noodle with runny egg dish as well as their fried rice with salted fish. Their roti prata was disappointing, pretty sure it was frozen - the curry sauce was also super watery. Desserts are delicious, I'd recommend trying a few of them, lots of different options. The food overall is kind of what you would expect to find from a street vendor in SE Asia, pretty greasy. Their restaurant décor is super unique and their menu is... surprisingly helpful since they include lots of descriptions and feedback about what others have said. It's honestly a really good family run joint that serves up some good food. It's not the best quality or anything like that, but you get good flavors and diversity of dishes. They have some really unique sounding dishes that I'll be sure to come back to try another time. It's a fast paced restaurant, good for takeout, not the nicest place to have a quiet meal or anything like that - this is for sure not fine dining by any means!"
705,"Super excited to try something else besides the usual Thai and Chinese around my workplace. I've heard good things about Indonesian cuisine and spice, so I came right along!Around Tuesday night the restaurant was around half empty - filled by a large party and mostly tables of 1 and 2. Even tagged with a Yelp sticker, I ordered the ayam goren bumbu bali (#66) with rice, plus some lime juice (#99) if I needed the assistance. Two chili peppers, above American spicy level, I figured was a good benchmark before subsequent visits.I will say I like how the dish was cooked. The chicken with the breading was fried perfectly like some of my favorite Asian places - and the sauce didn't compromise that crisp at all. Plus those flavors stuck on really well to the chicken. However, the spice level didn't really meet my expectations. Maybe they're used to dumbing it down for customers who aren't regulars, I don't know. I could get a hint of spicy because I could taste pepper, but it really just felt like sweet and sour chicken to me. Ah well, at least I had lime juice for casual sipping.I'm still curious but I'm not sure if I wan't to risk it again. How far do I go before I actually taste spicy delicious food - and will that next level just overshoot my taste buds? I'm probably tentative until I can come with reinforcements."
706,"I went last Friday with a new friend and it was a very nice intimate, mom and pop type restaurant. It was a bit hard to get the server's attention to order and I had to go up to the cashier to let them know we were ready to order. However, once we ordered the food came out in about 10 minutes. We both ordered the Mie Tek-Tek; I had mine at a level 2 spice and my friend got it at a level 3 spice. Mine was seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of kick, however, I think the level 3 spice was a bit much for my friend as she got most of her dish to go. The service was better after we got our dishes as the servers came by a few things to refill our water. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant and my dish, overlooking the slow service at the beginning of our visit."
707,"There isn't a lot of Indo/Singaporean food in the east bay and I think this one is really down home cooking. If you ever go when they are opened LOL, because they seem to always be on vacation.... must be that cash only business. If you go I would recommend the Ayam Goreng, which is the fried chicken in a sweet and sour sauce, also how can you go wrong with fried chicken?? I would also recommend the roti with curry sauce and the beef redang, which is a curry with beef in it. The food is solid, but it will give you a taste of what those regions have to offer. Don't expect the cleanest place because this is a small whole in the wall. Very affordable and will fill you up."
708,"We came here on a Friday around 6 pm and it was pretty busy! We got seated right away and ordered a yellow chicken curry, rendang, and some spicy soy sauce shrimp dish (don't remember the name but it was the first dish in the seafood section). The shrimp was really dry, I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry was decent, but the rendang was definitely the best out of the 3. We ordered sides of rice to go with the saucier dishes but it was dry. I'd expect this from a restaurant with lower traffic but like I said, this place was busy.It came out to be $52 for 3 pretty small dishes. (For context, the two of us ordered 2 dishes to share but we had to order a 3rd because we were still hungry after 2.) Wouldn't come here again by choice but I'd come along if a friend wanted to try it."
709,Best indonesian food in the bay area! I spent a month last year in Indonesia and my close friends live there and I love indonesian food! Everything here is great for the popular nasi goreng and mie tek tek as well as the beef rendeng and today I tried the laksi rice noodle.with shrimp & it was Excellent! Definitely stop by if youre in the berkeley area!
710,"Best food ever , and Highly recommend for everyone ! Food recommend 1.For healthy choice should order gado gado which is Indonesian salad serve with vegetable , boiled eggs tofu and peanut sauce .2.Goat fried rice"
711,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
712,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102.

731,"We ordered an Ayam goreng, a banana leaf shrimp, and a mi tek tek to go. They estimated 15 minutes for pick up and when we arrived our food was all bagged and ready. The mi tektek is a noodle dish heavily recommended by my friends. It's spicy, and the noodles were a bit crispy, but that's what I loved about it. The banana leaf shrimp tasted different than I had expected. It was a tad too mushy. I personally wasn't a fan, but my friend's enjoyed it. The ayam goreng is A+. It's a crispy sweet flavored meat (pork I believe?) with a hint of spice."
732,"So. Freakin'. Delicious.We had:3. MARTABAK TELOR [BEEF CREPE] - very interesting; delightfully crispy. Definitely tasted like it had some special spices that differentiated it from plain old ground beef filling. Not sure I'd order it again, but it was yum!51. KANGKUNG - with shrimp paste = A++. A huge plate that will enable appropriately large veggie intake during your meal. The fried tofu within with also a nice treat!70. RENDANG - good, but the portion was relatively small (4 pieces), given that this was one of the pricier items.87. LONTONG - thought this might be like Chinese-ish sticky rice, but was more of a rice loaf cut into pieces. Kind of interesting, but I'd skip it next time.102. BUBUR KETAN HITAM - one of my favorite desserts. Just a tad too sweet, but satisfying all the same. Curious to try the grilled banana but also scared of the cheese.Will definitely return!!"
733,"My wife, daughter, granddaughter and I went to this restaurant on Sunday (06/11/17) we ordered Roti Parata and Martabak telor (beef crepes) as appetizers. Both dishes came out nice and hot!! The dipping sauce for the roti was kind of bland. I could taste the seasoning was there just not enough. The crepe was fantastic, very crunchy and flavorful. We the ordered our main courses. Ayam Goreng saus Mantega, Mie tek-tek, and Nasi Goreng Ayam Jayakarta. All these dishes were outstanding, flavorful and seasoned just right (for me). All dishes came oue steaming hot!!!I though the guy who waited on us was fine. He was attentive and ensured we had everything we needed to enjoy our meal.I HIGHLY recommend this little hole in the wall restaurant.Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
734,"The mie tek2 and the noodle chicken were too salty, mie goreng was decent. Tempeh goreng was good with average sambal belacan. Love the pempek. Fried rice with chicken was delicious. The soto was really good, although needed emping cracker. Rest room was clean, thank God... The place was so busy but the waiter and waitress were friendly. Will come back"
735,"The first page of the menu features a full half-sheet of Yelpers squealing about how good the food is here, which sets the tone for how much reading you're going to do to make it through the enormous menu.We started with roti prata, which wasn't quite as flaky as I've had it, but it was greasy enough for dunking in the yellow curry sauce.We've been here twice and settled on the same main dishes. First up is the nasi bungkus, which is a banana-leafed combo packet that's only available on weekends. Big side of rice is teamed with beef rendang (beef coconut curry), gudeg (a stew of jackfruit and egg), and ayam goreng (fried chicken that has light curry flavors). The other dish is mie tek tek, which has consistently had great wok char. Sizzling egg noodles with runny egg, chicken, and veggies. Awesome selection of sweet icy drinks, and I'd recommend the es cendol (coconut milk, green jelly, palm sugar). Great place for a rainy day and the wait is never long. Service can be a bit slow, but it's a leisurely brunch kind of place anyway."
736,"Jayakarta is, I think, the most Berkeley restaurant: it's a family-owned hole-in-the-wall, it serves a kind of food that you've never heard of before, and it's awesome.The thing is, not everything is good here. There's a huge range of quality, to the point where I wonder how it's even possible that the good dishes, which are exquisitely good, could come from the same kitchen as the bad ones. I've tried most of the things on the menu and here are the three combinations that I like:- Beef rendang (beef in a curry sauce made extra rich with ground peanuts) and cah kangkung (sauteed water spinach; they will try to give you the regular kangkung with shrimp paste, but the cah kangkung with beef and egg is more flavorful). The mild kangkung brings out the flavors of the rendang.- Empek-Empek palembang (fried fish cake) and nasi bungkus. Nasi Bungkus is a packet of several different curries wrapped up in a banana leaf. You open the leaf and are enveloped in a fragrant cloud of steam. The flavors of the different curries are supposed to blend together.- Ayam panggang bumbu rujak (chicken with a peanuty curry sauce, kind of a chicken alternative to the beef rendang); terung belado (fried eggplant in chili sauce).I can finish any one of these combos off by myself and follow it with the superb black sticky rice dessert, but I'm a pretty big eater."
737,"I never tried Indonesian food before but Jayakarta is definitely a great start for this cuisine. Its popularity can be easily seen as there is always a long queue out there. First of all, the menu looks (well, I will leave this to Indonesian people to judge) very authentic: There are probably over 50 choices for entrees and several appetizers. They also offer some special drinks made from shaved ice which are very delicious. With so many choices, the reasonable prices made them even better. I enjoyed their special fried noodle. I dont remember the name but I noticed that almost every table ordered it.They also offer five levels of spicyness, and they claimed that their food is the spiciest in the Bay Area. Well, it did burn my tongue. Looking forward to my next visit."
738,"First time having Indonesian cuisine! Came here with my family and since we weren't too familiar with the menu, we asked the waitress for suggestions. Ended up ordering mie goreng, beef rendang, and a curry. I LOVE the instant mie goreng noodles you get at Ranch 99. You know, the one that's in the white packet and looks like it's ramen but it's not. So I was excited to try the real deal. Definitely did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and the flavor were exciting! Solid place for lunch/dinner."
739,"My friend was raving about this place and she wanted to take me here to try the food and I was open to it as long as it wasn't too spicy.  My friend, however, likes her food spicy.  Funny thing though she ordered the curry chicken and she asked for it to be medium spicy.  We also ordered the fish cake appetizer and it wasn't what I expected but it was tasty.I ordered #32, the Nasi Lemak, coconut rice surrounded by BBQ coconut chicken and a skewer of BBQ chicken. Served along side one perkedel (deep-fried ground potatoes), fresh cucumbers, and teri kacanag (fried anchovies mixed with peanuts ).  Unfortunately, my friend thought her curry chicken was a bit dry, not tender and all dark meat.  I guess she should have asked if it was white or dark meat chicken.  Mine was okay, alittle on the dry side took but we both enjoyed the fried anchovies!"
