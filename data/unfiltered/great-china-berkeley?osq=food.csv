0,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
2,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
3,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
4,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
5,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
6,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
7,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
8,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
9,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
10,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
11,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
12,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
13,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
14,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
15,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
16,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
17,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
18,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
19,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."

28,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
29,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

31,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

33,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
34,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
35,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
36,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
37,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
38,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
39,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
40,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
41,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
42,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
43,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
44,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
45,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
46,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
47,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."

Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
55,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
56,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
57,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
58,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
59,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
60,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
61,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
62,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
63,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
64,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
65,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
66,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
67,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
68,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
69,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
70,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
71,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
72,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
73,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
74,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville.

But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
85,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
86,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
87,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
88,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
89,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
90,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
91,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
92,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
93,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
94,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
95,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
96,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
97,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
98,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
99,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
100,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
101,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
102,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
103,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
104,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots.

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

113,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
114,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
115,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
116,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
117,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
118,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
119,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
120,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
121,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
122,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
123,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
124,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
125,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
126,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
127,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
128,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
129,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
130,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure

Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true.

When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
140,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
141,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
142,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
143,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
144,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
145,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
146,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
147,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
148,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
149,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
150,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
151,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
152,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
153,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
154,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
155,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
156,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
157,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
158,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
159,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order.

We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
168,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
169,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

171,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

173,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
174,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
175,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
176,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
177,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
178,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
179,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
180,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
181,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
182,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
183,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
184,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
185,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
186,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."

I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
195,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
196,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
197,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
198,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
199,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
200,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
201,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
202,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
203,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
204,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
205,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
206,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
207,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
208,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
209,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
210,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
211,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
212,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
213,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
214,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville.

224,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
225,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
226,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
227,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
228,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
229,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
230,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
231,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
232,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
233,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
234,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
235,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
236,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
237,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
238,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
239,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
240,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
241,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
242,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
243,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."

Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

251,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

253,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
254,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
255,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
256,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
257,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
258,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
259,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
260,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
261,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
262,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
263,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
264,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
265,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
266,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
267,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
268,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
269,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
278,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
279,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
280,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
281,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
282,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
283,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
284,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
285,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
286,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
287,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
288,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
289,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
290,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
291,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
292,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
293,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
294,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
295,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
296,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
297,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same.

When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
306,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
307,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
308,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
309,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

311,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

313,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
314,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
315,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
316,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
317,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
318,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
319,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
320,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
321,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
322,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
323,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
324,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
325,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use.

But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
335,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
336,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
337,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
338,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
339,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
340,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
341,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
342,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
343,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
344,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
345,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
346,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
347,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
348,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
349,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
350,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
351,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
352,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
353,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
354,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns.

363,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
364,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
365,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
366,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
367,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
368,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
369,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
370,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
371,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
372,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
373,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
374,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
375,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
376,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
377,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
378,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
379,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
380,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
381,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
382,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet.

389,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true.

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

393,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
394,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
395,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
396,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
397,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
398,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
399,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
400,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
401,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
402,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
403,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
404,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
405,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
406,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
407,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."

415,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
416,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
417,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
418,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
419,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
420,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
421,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
422,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
423,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
424,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
425,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
426,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
427,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
428,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
429,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
430,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
431,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
432,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
433,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
434,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."

But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
445,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
446,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
447,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
448,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
449,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
450,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
451,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
452,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
453,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
454,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
455,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
456,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
457,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
458,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
459,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
460,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
461,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
462,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
463,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
464,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish.

And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy!

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

473,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
474,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
475,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
476,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
477,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
478,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
479,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
480,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
481,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
482,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
483,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
484,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
485,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
486,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
487,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
488,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
489,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
490,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure

When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
500,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
501,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
502,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
503,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
504,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
505,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
506,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
507,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
508,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
509,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
510,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
511,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
512,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
513,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
514,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
515,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
516,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
517,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
518,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
519,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order.

We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
528,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
529,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

531,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

533,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
534,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
535,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
536,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
537,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
538,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
539,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
540,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
541,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
542,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
543,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
544,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
545,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
546,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."

I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
555,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
556,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
557,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
558,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
559,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
560,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
561,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
562,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
563,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
564,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
565,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
566,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
567,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
568,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
569,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
570,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
571,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
572,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
573,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
574,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville.

584,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
585,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
586,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
587,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
588,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
589,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
590,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
591,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
592,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
593,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
594,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
595,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
596,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
597,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
598,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
599,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
600,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
601,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
602,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
603,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."

Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

611,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

613,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
614,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
615,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
616,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
617,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
618,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
619,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
620,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
621,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
622,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
623,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
624,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
625,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
626,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
627,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
628,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
629,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
638,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
639,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
640,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
641,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
642,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
643,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
644,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
645,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
646,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
647,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
648,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
649,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
650,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
651,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
652,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
653,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
654,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
655,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
656,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
657,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same.

When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
666,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
667,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
668,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
669,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

671,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

673,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
674,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
675,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
676,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
677,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
678,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
679,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
680,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
681,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
682,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
683,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
684,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
685,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use.

But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
695,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
696,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
697,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
698,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
699,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
700,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
701,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
702,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
703,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
704,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
705,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
706,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
707,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
708,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
709,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
710,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
711,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
712,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
713,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
714,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns.

723,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
724,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
725,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
726,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
727,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
728,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
729,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
730,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
731,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
732,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
733,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
734,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
735,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
736,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
737,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
738,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
739,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
740,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
741,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
742,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet.

749,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow.

753,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
754,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
755,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
756,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
757,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
758,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
759,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
760,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
761,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
762,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
763,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
764,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
765,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
766,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
767,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."

775,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
776,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
777,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
778,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
779,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
780,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
781,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
782,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
783,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
784,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
785,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
786,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
787,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
788,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
789,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
790,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
791,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
792,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
793,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
794,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."

But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
805,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
806,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
807,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
808,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
809,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
810,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
811,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
812,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
813,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
814,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
815,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
816,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
817,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
818,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
819,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
820,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
821,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
822,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
823,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
824,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots.

And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy!

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

833,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
834,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
835,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
836,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
837,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
838,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
839,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
840,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
841,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
842,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
843,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
844,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
845,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
846,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
847,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
848,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
849,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
850,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure

When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
860,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
861,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
862,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
863,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
864,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
865,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
866,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
867,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
868,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
869,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
870,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
871,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
872,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
873,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
874,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
875,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
876,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
877,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
878,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
879,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order.

We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
888,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
889,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

891,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

893,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
894,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
895,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
896,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
897,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
898,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
899,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
900,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
901,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
902,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
903,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
904,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
905,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
906,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."

I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
915,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
916,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
917,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
918,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
919,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
920,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
921,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
922,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
923,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
924,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
925,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
926,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
927,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
928,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
929,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
930,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
931,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
932,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
933,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
934,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville.

944,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
945,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
946,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
947,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
948,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
949,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
950,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
951,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
952,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
953,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
954,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
955,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
956,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
957,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
958,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
959,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
960,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
961,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
962,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
963,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."

Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

971,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

973,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
974,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
975,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
976,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
977,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
978,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
979,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
980,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
981,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
982,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
983,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
984,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
985,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
986,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
987,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
988,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
989,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
998,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
999,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1000,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1001,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1002,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1003,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1004,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1005,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1006,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1007,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1008,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1009,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1010,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1011,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1012,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1013,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1014,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1015,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1016,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1017,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange.

When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1026,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1027,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1028,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1029,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow.

1033,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1034,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1035,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1036,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1037,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1038,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1039,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1040,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1041,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1042,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1043,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1044,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1045,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use.

But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1055,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1056,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1057,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1058,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1059,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1060,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1061,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1062,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1063,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1064,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1065,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1066,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1067,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1068,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1069,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1070,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1071,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1072,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1073,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1074,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns.

1083,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1084,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1085,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1086,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1087,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1088,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1089,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1090,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1091,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1092,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1093,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1094,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1095,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1096,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1097,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1098,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1099,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1100,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1101,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"

1108,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1109,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

1113,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1114,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1115,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1116,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1117,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1118,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1119,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1120,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1121,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1122,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1123,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1124,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1125,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1126,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1127,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."

I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1135,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1136,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1137,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1138,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1139,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1140,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1141,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1142,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1143,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1144,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1145,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1146,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1147,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1148,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1149,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1150,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1151,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1152,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1153,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1154,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners.

Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots.

And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1165,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1166,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1167,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1168,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1169,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1170,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1171,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1172,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1173,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1174,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1175,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1176,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1177,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1178,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1179,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1180,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1181,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1182,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1183,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."

Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow.

1193,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1194,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1195,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1196,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1197,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1198,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1199,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1200,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1201,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1202,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1203,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1204,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1205,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1206,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1207,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1208,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1209,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1218,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1219,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1220,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1221,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1222,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1223,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1224,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1225,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1226,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1227,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1228,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1229,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1230,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1231,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1232,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1233,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1234,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1235,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1236,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1237,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange.

When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1246,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1247,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1248,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1249,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

1253,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1254,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1255,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1256,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1257,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1258,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1259,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1260,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1261,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1262,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1263,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1264,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1265,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use.

But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1275,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1276,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1277,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1278,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1279,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1280,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1281,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1282,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1283,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1284,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1285,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1286,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1287,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1288,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1289,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1290,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1291,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1292,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1293,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1294,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long.

1303,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1304,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1305,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1306,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1307,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1308,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1309,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1310,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1311,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1312,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1313,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1314,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1315,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1316,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1317,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1318,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1319,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1320,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1321,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"

1328,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1329,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

1333,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1334,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1335,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1336,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1337,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1338,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1339,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1340,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1341,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1342,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1343,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1344,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1345,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1346,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1347,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."

I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1355,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1356,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1357,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1358,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1359,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1360,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1361,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1362,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1363,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1364,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1365,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1366,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1367,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1368,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1369,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1370,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1371,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1372,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1373,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1374,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners.

Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish.

I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1385,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1386,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1387,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1388,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1389,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1390,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1391,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1392,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1393,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1394,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1395,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1396,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1397,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1398,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1399,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1400,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1401,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1402,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1403,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."

Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true.

The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."

1413,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1414,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1415,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1416,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1417,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1418,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1419,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1420,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1421,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1422,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1423,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1424,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1425,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1426,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1427,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1428,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1429,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1438,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1439,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1440,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1441,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1442,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1443,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1444,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1445,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1446,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1447,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1448,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1449,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1450,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1451,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1452,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1453,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1454,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1455,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1456,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1457,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange.

When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1466,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1467,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1468,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1469,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

1473,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1474,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1475,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1476,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1477,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1478,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1479,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1480,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1481,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1482,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1483,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1484,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1485,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use.

But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1495,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1496,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1497,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1498,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1499,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1500,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1501,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1502,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1503,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1504,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1505,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1506,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1507,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1508,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1509,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1510,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1511,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1512,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1513,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1514,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns.

1523,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1524,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1525,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1526,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1527,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1528,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1529,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1530,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1531,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1532,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1533,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1534,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1535,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1536,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1537,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1538,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1539,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1540,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1541,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"

1548,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1549,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."

1553,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1554,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1555,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1556,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1557,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1558,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1559,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1560,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1561,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1562,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1563,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1564,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1565,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1566,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1567,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."

I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1575,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1576,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1577,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1578,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1579,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1580,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1581,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1582,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1583,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."
1584,"We got in line right at 5:30, when they opened for dinner. There was already a line forming at 4:30! I love the modem minimalist Cold War era decor warmed with eclectic modern art warm woods and hipster fixtures. In 20 minutes the place was packed full. The black bean noodles came first. Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1585,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1586,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1587,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1588,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1589,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1590,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1591,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1592,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1593,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1594,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners.

Huge freaked enough for a family of 5. But it lacked flavor. Chili oil and sauce added heat but my palette was like ""????"" Summer allergies often play tricks on me, rendering my ability to taste ineffective. However one glance at my better half across from me with pursed lipped smirk told me it wasn't my allergies. We rarely add table salt or pepper to anything but even after soy and chili oil we had to. Then I asked for chili sauce. I say we tried to coax what ever we could out that dish. The noodles were fat juicy and perfection in texture. The black bean sauce look luxurious like Mexican mole' and three ginormous shrimp topped the bowl with julienned cucumber. But it tasted like... well I don't know! It had no taste! The next we're Kung pao shrimp  which also sported ginormous shrimp with lots of peanuts, zucchini and peppers. Again slightly more flavor but not that omg moment.The generals chicken was perfectly sauces crunchy and sweet but a 2 on the flavor scale.The best dish was the pea shoot and garlic dish. However I did touch it up with black pepper and soy. Presentation was great and portions humongous! We took 3 of dishes to go (mostly the noods) the only thing we finished was the pea shoots. Wait staff plenty attentive enough but after a bus boy filled my water glass my non lipstick wearing wife notices lipstick on my glass. And no peeps plush pink is not my style if I'm wearing any at all (just kidding no way Jose)!Walking down shattack back to the car carrying the left overs, it felt like I was carrying luggage it was so heavy! I could not believe how something so dense and hefty lacked so much in flavor. Maybe it was us, maybe we ordered the wrong things. I don't know. I really wanted to love it, it was all there but the flavor."
1605,"Unsurprisingly, Great China was a hit for me. Right by the UC Berkeley campus, I came by here with some high school friends who are living and interning in the area on the recommendation of some co-workers. We rolled in around 8:45, just 45 minutes before they closed.One of my friends had previously been here. He's got his roots in Szechuan food, and made several recommendations including the twice-cooked pork and eggplant with hot garlic sauce. We tacked on a black bean fish filet dish since a friend of mine is pescatarian. I made a case for the Ants Climbing Up Tree, which was glass noodles cooked with shrimp and veggies. It indeed looks like a mottled cluster of small things mixed with glass noodles, but damn if it isn't delicious.None of the dishes were particularly spicy, although they appeared red and flush with dried chilies. I'd recommend all of the things we purchased without hesitation, especially the twice-cooked pork. The pork is made with both pork shoulder slabs of fatty pork belly, complete with rind. Bean curd and cabbage are perfect complements to the sauce. The eggplant was also surprisingly soft and delicious. I think Great China has prepared the only eggplant dish in the world that I've enjoyed.The food here is delicious, although there's something about it that makes me think it's a little less authentic than the Chinese food I'm used to. I'll echo other Yelpers' sentiments that it's definitely got its roots in traditional Chinese food, but without the intensity of flavor that I tend to find in other grittier Chinatown joints. Perhaps it's the lack of nose-blowing spice, or the lack of grease. It's also set in a trendy space, with dim lighting, dark wood accents, and a very well-stocked bar. But hey, maybe I'm just not used to paying $20 a person for Chinese food in a trendy setting, minus ""Asian fusion.""Servers here are efficient and no-nonsense. Someone came by to take our order within a minute of us sitting down, and we had to pass because we had barely cracked the spine of one of the leather-bound menus. We were unsure if our waitress even got down our order because she was looking away while writing it down, and didn't bother to repeat it. When we also tacked on rice for 4 to the order (seriously, charging for rice *and* tea?), she cut us off and said that last call would be at 9:30 p.m. Yeah, we weren't planning to stay that long past the closing time.There are four single-gender bathrooms in total, which are always in use. Plenty of space and accessible tables, as all chairs can be pulled out to make room for wheelchairs and high chairs."
1606,"Very basic. I'm from toronto so Asian food is pretty damn good there. Unfortunately Great China doesnt measure up as well. Food is good and the place itself is really nice. Clean, friendly service and food comes out really quick. I wasn't the biggest fan of Peking duck here (maybe it's the way they do it in America). If you've tried Toronto Peking duck, you'll never go back. But I'm glad I tried it so see how they do it here."
1607,"Great China came highly recommended by locals so decided to try it. Came around noon on a Wednesday and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. They are known to have line wrapped around the block on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations. Food wise, i highly recommend it. We ordered the Peking duck and I have to say, I prefer their Peking duck over anywhere else because they remove all visible fat for you before serving. Some people like the fat but I am usually one picking it out as I eat.The On Choy vegetable was really fresh and had awesome garlic flavor. We had few other dishes and they were all delicious.The service was impeccable; the hostess even served me hot tea as we were waiting for a table. The only negative aspect about eating here is the noise level. Very noisy and hard to hear across the table. I will be back though for the Peking duck."
1608,"I should tell you this place is horrible so you stay away cuz the lines are too long as it is.  Ha ha, but I must be true to my fellow Yelpers...I love this place!  The Peking duck is done nicely.  I don't think it can surpass the taste of the Peking Duck I've eaten in DaDong or QuanJude in Beijing but it is good.  They serve their duck with crepe-like wraps and they are similar to the ones in Beijing.  The main difference is Great China's duck is a little drier and the skin is not as crispy.  But so far, I think it is the best one I've had in the Bay Area.I heard so much about the double skin (sounds yucky to me) so I had to try it.  It goes so nicely with the duck because the duck is fatty but the double skin is refreshing.  The flavor is like a tangy hot mustard dressing with a mix of room temp ingredients.  Sort of a cross between a salad and a stir fry.  It is served in 3 sizes: S, M, L.  A small was enough for 2-3 people if you are also getting the duck and other dishes.  I never saw this dish anywhere else so be adventurous and try this dish; you won't be disappointed.The walnut prawn was good but I can't say it was exceptional.  I think it is on par with many other places so if you need to save stomach space for more duck, I'd say skip this.  But if your table has many mouths to feed, this one won't disappoint either.  It is tasty.The last dish I tried on my first adventure to Great China is the snow pea sprouts.  I was a bit let down on this dish.  It tasted like it was blanched so the flavor was a bit lacking.  Other places I've tried cook it with some broth or maybe some fats that give it a silky texture.  So this dish I don't recommend.The service was very good ""for a Chinese restaurant"" (they didn't yell at me or slam anything down).  They are polite but because the restaurant is packed, they aren't attentive either.  They did forget to pack an item I explicitly asked for so that was a bummer.Yeah, this place is packed so get a group of 6+ people and make reservations.  I'm definitely going back so see ya there!!!!"
1609,"Food 5/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Look no further for Peking duck. Great china is probably the best place to get it. There's a ton of Chinese restaurants around the east bay, but Great China is more upscale than most. The price reflects that but the food quality and service is far superior. The restaurant itself has a ton of space and a good amount of tables. However, if you can get a reservation do so. At peak hours for dinner, the wait can be up to 45 minutes. Let me rave a little about their lunch specials. If you are ever in area at lunch come here. For around $12 dollars, you get to pick a main entree like kung pao chicken or walnut shrimp, fried rice, egg roll, and a salad. The quality is far superior than a regular Chinese shop, and less oily than most Chinese food. If I ever go for dinner I have to get the Peking duck. The duck skin is crispy, flavorful, and stripped of fat. The duck meat itself is tender and piled on the plate under the duck skin. Unlike other places, the Peking duck comes with thin pancakes instead of steamed buns. These pancakes allow you to taste the duck better, and serves as a better wrapping tool. This dish can easily be shared with four people. The other dishes I would get is the double skin, hot and sour soup, Mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, and kung pao anything. Overall, it's a great Chinese restaurant with great service and ambiance. Tips - For the lunch special come before 11:30 to get in line! Also don't make the mistake of coming on Tuesday, it's closed! Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1610,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1611,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1612,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1613,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1614,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1615,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1616,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1617,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1618,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1619,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
1620,"4 stars for Peking Duck and Salt and Pepper Squid. Salt and pepper squid was delicately fried and light,-tasting with crispy bits of fried garlic, jalapeños and scallions. I love salt and pepper squid/calamari and must order it at every restaurant but this one was especially good.Peking duck was soft and tender and the skin was perfectly crispy and salty without being too fatty. I don't have any comparison for Peking duck in the Bay Area but I would highly recommend!2 stars for string beans and Zha jang Myun, noodles tasted fresh but could have used more flavor or seasoning. Service was prompt and while the servers weren't particularly chatty, it was polite enough. Nice ambience. Will probably bring the parents next time. Lastly, no wait at Saturday 11:30 am!"
1621,"I remember the good old days when Great China was a hole in the wall on Kittredge.  Fond memories of enjoying a large delicious lunch plate of lemon chicken over rice, where the wait was short - and the prices were quite low...Well fast forward 20 years later.  Now the lines are long and the prices are astronomical.  I've come by several times only to be scared away by the lines and high prices each and every time.  Tonight I decided to bite the bullet and wait the 20-30 minutes for a table.  Was this restaurant really worth the hype?  The answer is...YES!  They've elevated...  Chinese food to something different, something delicately amazing, and absolutely delicious.  Nicely sized portions, although expensive - made up the price differential in elevated, magnificent taste!  OK the atmosphere was a lot more upscale compared to the Great China of old,  but I must admit the RZA-Inspired dinner soundtrack was *off the hook*!To date this was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants i've ever been to - hands down awwwwesome!"
1622,"I honestly do not know how this is not a 5.0 reviewNo you can't make reservations. Yes you have to wait in a long line especially on the weekendsBUTIt's all because the food is tremendous. Been here a handful of times and it's never disappointed. Most recently we came on a Thursday night and got the spring rolls, cumin braised lamb, and ginger fish fillet. Previous visits included their famous Peking duck and hot sour soupYou're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here"
1623,"I live in San Jose, and will always make s trip to eat here. The Peking duck is absolutely amazing. The service is mediocre, similar to any Chinese restaurant you go to. I don't expect the servers to go above and beyond. You have to flag them down to order anything.As mentioned, the Peking duck is a must order anytime I come here. This is the only restaurant that scrapes off the fat from the duck skin and the skin remains crispy to the bite. They also cut the duck meat into bite size pieces without the fat. My next must order item is the fish dumplings. They are made in small bite size pieces. The skin is thin enough so it doesn't take away from the fish texture inside. We also tried the pork dumplings, and again the skin of the dumpling was done very well. I personally prefer the fish dumplings. We ordered a bunch of veggie dishes: eggplant, snow pea leaves, green beans, and tofu. All of these dishes were done very well. For each dish, the veggies were never over or undercooked. This is difficult for eggplant, as it often turns out into a mush. The eggplant was not only cooked to perfection, but it was tangy and flavourful. We also ordered a garlic fried rice and seafood noodle. Although they look like any other rice or noodle dish from other restaurants, both dishes were cooked perfect and tasted great. I can confidently say that you could order any dish and not be disappointed. The only complaint I have is that the dishes are not large enough to share between 10 adults."

Pros - Great quality Chinese food, less oily than most. Generous portions. Cons - Can get crowded and busy without a dinner reservations."
1630,1 star because came here from San Jose on one of my few days off only to see a printed sign they were closed for a week without warning or notification on yelp.Don't plan on ever making it back to Berk for this joint ... my loss I'm sure
1631,"Gua ta tofu - Savory, hearty, and filling despite being all vegetables and tofu. Must share among three people. Flavors were not memorable. Double skin - Mix of different of flavors for a delightful salad. It was light and refreshing. Portion sizes run true. Two people will feed two hungry people.Peking Duck - According to my SO, best duck in a Chinese restaurant in the Bay area by far. The pancakes are an interesting spin from the traditional bao.Domaine Sigalas white wine - Good. Interior - Most beautiful and modern interior for a Chinese restaurant I've ever seen. Service - Slow. Too many tables per one waiter. It was hard to get their attention. Wait time - Expected but about 15 minutes for a table for 4 on Friday night 8pm."
1632,"Tied with chef chu's in South Bay for best traditional Chinese American dining experience in the country, not just Bay Area. I would actually say that this modern, artistic space puts it above by a notch. Get the following (for 4) and enjoy:General chicken Walnut prawnsFried rice with just eggString beansEggplantMao po tofu Hot and sour soup with egg - the best Chinese soup I have ever had in my life"
1633,"Great flavors and portions! My friend from UCB decided to take me here since I wanted good Asian food. We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, Peking duck, and minced pork string beans. The flavors were really authentic. The crisp of the calamari appetizer was the perfect crispness and the garlic chips were a good compliment to it. The string beans were also very tasty so I kept wanting to eat it. The pancakes of the duck was really good cause it was the thin one like the ones they use for mu shu pork. The duck meat was a bit dry but overall the duck was really fresh and the portion size for it was really good. The interior is really nice and the servers are nice as well. Definitely recommend for you to check out this place if you want nice authentic food!"
1634,"Great China has been on my radar for what seems like an entire generation now as my parents had been to their original location by the California Theatre, which unfortunately burned in a fire, but now they are thriving on the corner of Bancroft and Fulton Streets, catacorner to the Cal Campus in what was formerly a barbecue joint and Thai restaurant. I must say they did a great job expanding and remodeling the interior. Cement is everywhere from the floors to the walls to the ceilings, it's sleek and sexy without being overly dark and dank. I give them credit for keeping the sun room that used to be a feature of the previous tenants but still expanding their dining room to make it more diner friendly for big parties. And what a party that was going on at Great China. After hearing all the buzz and reading all of the reviews from my fellow Yelpers. I knew there were no reservations for parties of six or less and since it is a first come first serve waiting room only type of deal I knew we had to get there by their opening by 5:30pm to avoid waiting too long. Once we got there and stood around for a while, the crowd certainly thickened as it gathered before the doors were unlocked, but thankfully it never got too insane, as the Cal campus was no longer filled with students and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly who knows?In looking at my fellow Yelpers reviews, there were four things that were must gets the Double Skin, Peking Roast Duck, Mei Cai Ko Ro (pork belly), and the Sauteed Crab Meat with Steamed Buns. All of those dishes were described with aplomb and sounded absolutely delicious. But obviously the reason we were here on this day is the fact we came for their signature dish, their Peking Roast Duck and at $38.95 is quite pricey but in my opinion worth it because it comes with the full roasted duck de-boned and laid out in a beautiful presentation with the cut and pulled duck meat on the bottom and the roasted skin on the top of the plate with the green onion scallions and plum sauce served on the side with the very unique twenty-four pancakes, which really weren't pancakes at all but rather thick pancake like skins that you see as wraps for say Vietnamese Spring Rolls, but this time they were folded in half you the diner has to unfold them like a tortilla skin and of course fill it with your requisite pulled duck pieces, crispy duck skin along with plum sauce and scallions. I really liked this unique texture of what are basically Peking Duck mini wraps with a decent amount of oil mixed in with the duck and the skin. It was nice and crunchy which only added to the overall bites. As we all continuously slathered on the plum sauce and scallions for each ""sandwich"" we each made, as soon as we ran out, our server/ table buser made sure we had more sides of plum sauce and scallions and we didn't need to ask him to refill us, so that was a nice touch service-wise.To accompany our meal, we knew we had to go for another starch and protein so we went with the Seafood Fried Rice with scallops, calamari, shrimp and egg whites along with the Chinese String Beans with Beef. I found the fried rice tasted very light which is just the way I like it, not too heavy or syrupy as it impressively was filled with a bevy of seafood, including plenty of scallops and calamari, but the beef was a little too greasy for me, but the overall dish was still filled with plenty of roughage including lots of string beans. We decided to only go with three dishes because a) the prices are rather exorbitant even for gourmet Chinese Food in Berkeley and b) we really came for the Peking Duck which was so uniquely presented that if we only ate that, we'd be happy diners. I really like Great China and I am glad they are here in downtown Berkeley in a hip and lively location for people to enjoy for those who don't want to go to Oakland Chinatown or Emeryville. Good service and well presented dishes offer a nice option for those who need to get their Chinese Food fix on in the local area."
1635,"After trying to food at Great China, I can see why there are so many positive reviews for Great China. I came here with my sister after she recommended the place for dinner. We came here around 6:30 and the restaurant was packed. We were told that there was an hour 15min to an hour 30min wait before we would be seated. If you want to avoid waiting for this place, I recommend coming before they open so you can make sure to be the first wave of people who get seated or after 8:30pm. The crowd seemed to die down around 8:30-9pm. We were eventually seated around 7:40pm. We ordered Fish Dumplings, Peking Duck, Guo Ta Tofu, and Snow Pea Leaves. The fish dumplings were better than I expected, the texture was very soft and the dipping sauce went really well with the dumpling. The dumplings were actually kind of cute because they looked like bite-sized dumplings, which I've never seen. The Peking Duck came with thin wraps and was as amazing as people said they were. There were a lot of meat under the layers of skins. The meat was really tender while the skins were nice and crisp. Unlike a lot of places that serve Pekin Duck, this place cuts off all the fat from the skins which is very impressive. The Guo Ta tofu was good and felt pretty light. I was a bit surprised that the tofu seemed more like a firm tofu rather than a soft/silky one but the dish was still very good. I liked the Snow Pea Leaves too but I'm not sure if I would order it again because I don't think it's worth it. For whatever reason, all the vegetable dishes at Great China were around the $15-18 range and I don't understand why these dishes are so expensive. Overall I had a really good dining experience and would love to come back to try other dishes. Pros:-Amazing food with lots of variety-Nice, modern atmosphere -Decent service (for a Chinese restaurant)-Parking was surprisingly not difficultCons:-Long wait (expect at least an hour if you don't go before they open)-Food was a bit salty, I found myself going through 5+ cups of water -Relatively expensive for Chinese food (especially for the vegetables)"
1636,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Berkeley, their Peking duck is the most authentic one in Bay Area, very well roasted; also their fish, everything is flavorful.Service too, polite; the cashier girls are pretty, and even remember my name too, haha, I like that; better to reserve table if u have big group, so popular.If you have small group like 2, even they tell you it's 10-15 mins wait, but usually it takes less than 10 mins.Good price value; worth a try."
1637,"Great China is fine if you want a more upscale dining experience, but I've had so many experiences with much more authentic Chinese food at a much lower price. Their dishes are pretty hit or miss for me - the Peking duck, while a bit pricey, is quite good and reminds me of the duck I've had in Beijing. Some other dishes like their chicken lettuce wraps and green beans are also pretty good. However, I went here for lunch once and their lunch specials are quite gross - the specials come standard with a protein or veggie entree, rice, salad, egg roll, and a slice of orange. The amount of food you get is fine for the price, but every single entree is covered in the same savory, gooey sauce - I went for lunch with a large group of friends once and we tried to order a variety of specials, but everything pretty much was the same. Whether you order black pepper beef or kung pao chicken or just vegetables. They somehow ALL have this same sauce. For how much that cost, it was really disappointing to get every dish with this vague sauce."
1638,"Hands down, Great China is the best Chinese restaurant in Berkeley. Food overall is clean as you don't feel greasy afterwards! Try their walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork, kungpao beef, and mapo tofu. I gotta say those were my favorites. They also have some Korean dishes such as black bean paste noodles (jajjangmyeon) and Korean version of sweet and sour pork.And I really love the vibe that it has. It is super clean and very trendy even though lot of Chinese restaurants tend to go very traditional style with its interior design."
1639,"Horrible service.TL;DR1. Took the wrong order.2. Did not apologize.3. Instead, argued that we placed the wrong order.4. Offered no remedies.Ordered a take out and got the wrong order. When we called again, the restaurant started arguing with us and claimed that we placed the wrong order when the fact was that the person who took our order ""ASSUMED"" we had ordered something else. An apology here would have solved most of the problems but no, we got an excuse.We had to drive all the way back to pay an EXTRA amount of money for our ""correct"" order and the restaurant offered no remedy of any kind.Would give 0 stars if possible."
