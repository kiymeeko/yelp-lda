0,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
1,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
2,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
3,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
4,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
5,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
6,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
7,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
8,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
9,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
10,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
11,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
12,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
13,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
14,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
15,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
16,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
17,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
18,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
19,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"

45,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
46,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
47,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
48,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
49,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
50,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
51,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
52,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
53,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
54,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
55,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
56,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
57,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
58,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
59,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
60,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
61,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
62,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
63,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
64,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."

Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
95,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
96,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
97,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
98,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
99,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
100,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
101,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
102,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
103,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
104,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
105,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
106,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
107,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
108,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
109,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
110,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
111,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
112,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
113,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."

FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
143,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
144,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
145,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
146,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
147,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
148,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
149,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
150,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
151,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
152,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
153,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
154,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
155,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
156,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
157,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
158,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
159,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
160,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
161,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."

188,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
189,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
190,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
191,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
192,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
193,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
194,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
195,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
196,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
197,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
198,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
199,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
200,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
201,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
202,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
203,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
204,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
205,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
206,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
207,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant.

237,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
238,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
239,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
240,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
241,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
242,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
243,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
244,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
245,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
246,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
247,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
248,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
249,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
250,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
251,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
252,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
253,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
254,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.

It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
283,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
284,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
285,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
286,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
287,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
288,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
289,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
290,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
291,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
292,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
293,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
294,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
295,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
296,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
297,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
298,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
299,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
300,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
301,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
302,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!).

Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
330,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
331,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
332,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
333,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
334,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
335,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
336,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
337,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
338,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
339,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
340,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
341,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
342,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
343,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
344,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
345,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
346,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
347,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
348,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."

379,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
380,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
381,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
382,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
383,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
384,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
385,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
386,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
387,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
388,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
389,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
390,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
391,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
392,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
393,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
394,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
395,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
396,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
397,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."

They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
425,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
426,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
427,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
428,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
429,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
430,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
431,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
432,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
433,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
434,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
435,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
436,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
437,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
438,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
439,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
440,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
441,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
442,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
443,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
444,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed.

There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
473,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
474,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
475,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
476,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
477,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
478,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
479,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
480,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
481,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
482,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
483,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
484,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
485,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
486,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
487,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
488,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
489,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
490,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
491,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
492,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan.

We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
521,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
522,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
523,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
524,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
525,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
526,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
527,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
528,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
529,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
530,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
531,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
532,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
533,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
534,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
535,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
536,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
537,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
538,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
539,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
540,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date.

We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
566,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
567,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
568,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
569,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
570,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
571,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
572,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
573,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
574,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
575,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
576,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
577,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
578,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
579,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
580,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
581,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
582,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
583,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
584,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
585,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much.

615,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
616,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
617,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
618,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
619,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
620,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
621,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
622,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
623,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
624,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
625,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
626,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
627,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
628,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
629,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
630,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
631,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
632,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
633,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
634,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.

It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
663,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
664,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
665,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
666,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
667,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
668,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
669,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
670,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
671,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
672,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
673,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
674,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
675,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
676,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
677,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
678,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
679,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
680,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
681,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
682,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK.

Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
710,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
711,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
712,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
713,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
714,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
715,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
716,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
717,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
718,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
719,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
720,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
721,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
722,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
723,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
724,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
725,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
726,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
727,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
728,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."

759,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
760,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
761,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
762,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
763,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
764,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
765,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
766,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
767,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
768,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
769,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
770,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
771,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
772,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
773,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
774,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
775,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
776,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
777,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."

They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
805,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
806,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
807,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
808,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
809,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
810,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
811,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
812,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
813,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
814,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
815,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
816,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
817,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
818,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
819,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
820,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
821,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
822,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
823,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
824,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed.

There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
853,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
854,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
855,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
856,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
857,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
858,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
859,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
860,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
861,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
862,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
863,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
864,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
865,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
866,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
867,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
868,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
869,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
870,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
871,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
872,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan.

We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
901,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
902,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
903,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
904,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
905,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
906,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
907,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
908,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
909,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
910,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
911,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
912,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
913,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
914,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
915,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
916,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
917,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
918,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
919,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
920,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date.

We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
946,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
947,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
948,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
949,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
950,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
951,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
952,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
953,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
954,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
955,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
956,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
957,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
958,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
959,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
960,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
961,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
962,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
963,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
964,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
965,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much.

995,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
996,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
997,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
998,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
999,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
1000,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
1001,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
1002,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
1003,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
1004,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
1005,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
1006,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
1007,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
1008,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
1009,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
1010,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
1011,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
1012,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
1013,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
1014,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.

It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
1043,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
1044,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
1045,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
1046,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
1047,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
1048,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
1049,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
1050,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
1051,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
1052,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
1053,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
1054,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
1055,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
1056,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
1057,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
1058,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
1059,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
1060,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
1061,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
1062,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK.

1089,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
1090,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
1091,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
1092,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
1093,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
1094,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
1095,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
1096,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
1097,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
1098,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
1099,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
1100,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
1101,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
1102,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
1103,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
1104,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
1105,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
1106,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
1107,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
1108,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."

We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
1138,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
1139,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
1140,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
1141,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
1142,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom. It is a single-stall bathroom and was sooo gross. The floor was completely disgusting leaving my shoes sooooo sticky!! I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
1143,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
1144,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
1145,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
1146,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
1147,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
1148,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
1149,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
1150,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
1151,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
1152,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
1153,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
1154,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
1155,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
1156,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"

I'll spare you the details, but this was nasty.  OVERALL: I would recommend taking the sushi to-go. Not a bad place, but not a replacement for Joshu-ya's :("
1183,"I think the sushi here is very average... the rolls are TINY and filled with wayyyyy too much rice. You have to pay and order before getting to sit down and that really annoys me as I'm standing in line frantically flipping through the menu pages to decide what I want. Also, the waitress forgot about my order and it took them 20+ minutes to bring it out. On the bright side, the nigiri isn't that bad. I got the combination tray with nigiri and different sushi rolls, the rolls weren't tasty and just weren't great. This restaurant isn't terrible but if you want really good sushi, spend your money elsewhere."
1184,"Don't expect amazing quality from this local neighborhood sushi restaurant. The food here is okay, and the main draw to this restaurant is the price and speed. When walking up to the restaurant, notice that there is two sides. One side is a sit down restaurant while the other one is order before you sit, so pick accordingly (both sides have the same menu). On the order before you sit side, there is a fridge area with pre-made sushi. As well, there is a hot bar side usually filled with spam musubi or chicken teriyaki bowls. They aren't the best quality, but serve as quick grab-to-go foods. After 9pm, these pre-made foods are half off, as Manpuku tries to sell off their food. The maki and rolls are the best part of this restaurant. They also serve items such udon, soba, ramen, sushi, donburi, bento boxes and other Japanese items but are mediocre at best . The maki are affordable, and each come with 6 pieces each. The rolls are a little more elaborate but have the same concepts of maki, with a few extra ingredients and pieces.  The maki here are different than other places, with maki with ingredients such as mango and eel or fried asparagus and mango, but they also provide traditional ones as well. For a Japanese restaurant, the portions are generous for such a cheap price for Japanese. However, the overall food lacks in quality and presentation. Thus, the overall environment is very casual with bar seats and tables. Don't expect to come here with a big group since tables seat 2 or 4 people, and there isn't much space to combine tables."
1185,"The short: delicious ramenAfter a long hike over in Marin, the friends and I wanted something filling. We arrived around 7:30.  There was no wait! On the menu were a variety of items that I don't see often like curry, soba, yakisoba, etc. I ordered the Champon ramen, which was surprisingly delicious. The broth had a light and impactful essence and it wasn't salty either. The ramen was on the firm side, which I like. Even the toppings were plentiful and delicious.Noise level was on the loud side, though that didn't bother us much. Service was friendly and though they seem short-staffed, they were able to take care of every one in a timely manner.After we left, we noticed that there was a second side next door. We had wondered why the kitchen on our side looked dead and realized all the cooking was happening on the other side.Verdict: wouldn't mind coming back for the ramen and to try out other things on the menu"
1186,"Acceptable sushi at an affordable price. My dh and I had a salmon teriyaki bento box, assorted tuna sashimi, a sashimi bent box and 2 CA roll appetizer portions and 2 green teas for lunch (we did not have breakfast). The tab came to around $40-$50.Would I go there again? Only for sushi and sashimi--the salmon was dry and meh, and if I was hoping to refuel on Japanese food."
1187,"Yelp reviews weren't bad so thought I try it but when I saw the place, I was unsure but still went through with it. It's a order and pay first then sit down kind of restaurant. Not much tables so come during a less busy time, I came during the lunch rush so it wasn't too bad. Very small place, gets pretty crowded. Sushi was affordable and was pretty cheap, and sushi was pretty good. They did all salmon nigiri for me also!"
1188,"Came here for lunch craving some ramen. Ordered the Miso Ramen which is my usual go to at all ramen restaurants. The broth was bland and tasted like watered down miso. The egg was just a hard boiled egg and not the proper marinated egg. Also I have never seen fresh tofu pieces in ramen (it's not miso soup!) One of the worst ramen I've ever had. An extra star off as it took a long time, and customers who ordered the same ramen after me, got theirs first."
1189,"Bottom Line: Decent sushi and ramen that matches expectations for the price.We needed a quick bite before catching a movie across the street and decided to give Manpuku a shot. I appreciated that vegetarian items were clearly marked on the menu in green font. I ordered two rolls: avocado maki and the Futo Maki (""Big Vegetarian Roll""). Girlfriend took a shot with the Shoyu ramen. It comes with pork but she asked to substitute chicken and they obliged even though they ""don't normally do substitutions"". She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
1190,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
1191,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
1192,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
1193,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
1194,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
1195,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
1196,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
1197,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
1198,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
1199,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
1200,"When you consider the pricing, wait time, and taste, Manpuku is a good deal.It is surprisingly cheap for being located in Elmwood. I got their miso ramen with a side of california rolls and my boyfriend got their spicy ramen with avocado maki. Each were less than $10, which is a steal for ramen. You could also pair it with up to two sides, each side being $2.95. The wait time was not long at all. Probably around 5-8 minutes for both of our ramen, during which I was happily snacking on the California rolls. The taste was maybe a little subpar, but I thought it was still worth it. My base tasted like light miso, but as the broth cooled down and I zoned out a bit, it also tasted like nothing in moments. Maybe they could've used more flavor enhancement to enrich the base and keep my senses engaged. My boyfriend's ramen was so spicy I coughed; it tasted like they like dumped a bunch of red pepper in, whereas I would've preferred a spiciness that was more flavorful. The California rolls were obviously not high quality but they were yummy. The avocado maki I had a slight issue with since they were so sloppily done--an avocado chunk was sticking out of the top of one roll. Overall, it was a cute, cheap date. We got what we wanted and would probably go back when craving quick, cheap ramen."
1201,"The food was so bad I wasn't able to finish my ramen -- and that almost never happens. I ordered their signature ramen ""Manpuku"". On the menu it was described as having a spicy soy sauce base with veggies and fish cakes.When it came out, it was veggies with tasteless noodles in a tepid soup. Definitely not spicy. I dug around and was unable to locate any fish cakes. When I flagged down the server, she was ""Oh yes"" -- this is a common complaint. She brought a tiny bowl of cold fish cakes and left it on the table. Eating them gave me no joy and didn't improve the tasteless bowl of soup.There was a very real sense that the staff here just do not care about food or their customers. On a positive note, as we were walking out in disgust we were able to save another party from dining here -- hopefully they found joy during lunch, elsewhere."
1202,"Came here with friends after discovering that Joshu-ya Brasserie has CLOSED! What :(?! Was hoping to discover my next go-to sushi restaurant in Berkeley, but sadly, I don't think Manpuku is it. Tip: If you are with a party of more than 2 people, go next door! It has the same menu & food but is more of a sit-down restaurant rather than an order/quick bite place. FOOD (3.5/5) Not bad, but not super memorable. I had the rainbow roll, which was pretty good. Other people ordered the swamp roll, spicy crunch roll, and a couple of other things that have escaped my mind. We all had the miso soup (not complimentary) which was OK. SERVICE (2.5/5) Service was friendly, but soooo slow! It took them 20+ minutes to collect our check when we put the credit card down, and I had to get up and physically hand it to someone to process it (probably would've taken way longer if we just waited for them to come back!). It wasn't very crowded at the time either so kind of strange. AMBIANCE (2.5/5)The whole restaurant was nice, but not super fancy - which is completely ok! The problem I had was with the bathroom.

She thought the fish in the sushi case didn't look particularly fresh, so decided against a fishy roll. I wanted beer but we discovered that beer is only served next door at the sit-down part. You order at a counter and then the food comes out by number. Ours arrived quickly and was nicely presented. Sushi was tasty enough and girlfriend was pleased with the ramen after she doctored it with shichimi togarashi and chile oil. They were very generous with the chicken! Overall, it was pretty good, especially for the price. Ambiance leaves something to be desired but fits the bill for a quick bite."
1230,"Love their Poki Maki! :) I don't have to look at their menu haha, I would always order their Poki Maki and avocado maki!"
1231,"This place is great! So cheap and good! We bought a bento box $9, combo of ramen, Gyoza and cha-han (shrimp rice) for $15. Amazing!"
1232,"This place is what I would call ""if you want Japanese food just for a fix"" place. Manpuku has a variety of items that could also be found in the cafeterias in Japan. Thus, you can find udon, soba, ramen, sushi, bento boxes, donburi, amongst other typical Japanese food items here. The portions are good, and although the food is lacking in the higher quality and presentation typically found and expected from fancier Japanese restaurants, it is in exchange for single digit meals, most under $10-12.The environment is casual to fit with the vibe of quickly served Japanese food. There are plenty of seats in the restaurants, with bar seating and tables of 2 or 4. Large groups may have difficulty sitting together here.In addition to dine-in and to-go options for orders, there is also a deli fridge next to the cashier if you're really on the go and simply need sushi or a bento box (or some dessert).Lastly, a tip that there is a $0.50 charge for orders under $10. That means that if you order one item from the menu, it is to your benefit to bring cash."
1233,"Since I first tried Manpuku a couple years back, the price of the food has gone up, but I think the corresponding quality of food and service has as well, which is probably for the best. Still ""good and affordable Japanese food"" but no longer ""not bad and cheap but you get what you pay for."" I'm a fan of the sashimi that comes with the bentos. 3 pieces of each of some great fish selections. The fish is always fresh and comes with relatively nice cuts (none of that gristle or other weird chewy stuff). The tonkatsu is pretty bomb too usually, although sometimes it's a bit inconsistent."
1234,This place has the best tempura (for this price range). Miso soup and side salad are very good. Love that the salad has a good mix of different herbs and vegetables in a delicious miso sauce!This is the go to place for good quality and descent priced sushi. The fish is fresh and the food is very tasty. The salmon teriyaki was pretty standard and not too impressive; the fish was too overcooked though. We also tried the crunch tempura roll and umami (mango plus eel) which were both very good. Ika (squid) nigiri was fresh and good too. Service was really slow and we kept having to flag them down. They messed up our order as well.
1235,"Wanted to try Ramen for the first time.Service was ok.Ordered the Veggie ramen, not bad. Had a nice light flavor. Almost all ramen are made with pork so, that was a bummer. Items on menu are super cheap."
1236,"I have come to Manpuku off and on for the last 5 years.  When I first came here I was amazed by the low prices.  While the portion might be a little smaller, it seemed like we could feed 5 for $55.  Times have changed a little and my tastes and benchmarks have evolved.  After my visit today, I was reminded about the small portion.  While the prices have increased, the portion seems to be getting smaller.  6 small pieces in a roll.  The fish in the chirachi was cut small as well.  Let's talk ramen.  I also got the  Hokkaido ramen.  I would say this was not good.  No because I have become a ramen snob, but it was lacking on flavor.  There were a lot of noodles + Broth was lacking creamy porkiness -Tofu in the bowl -Egg over cooked  --Chashu + one piece -What did I learn today?  Manpuku's low prices, quality, and portion cater to the college crow"
1237,"I stopped by Manpuku with a few friends today. The staff was really friendly & the space was clean. We ordered our food & sat at a 4 top. Our food was on our table in ten minutes. We all had sushi. It was fresh & fast. They offer free hot tea & have a cooler full of sushi to go. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
1238,"Being from Vancouver, I usually don't eat sushi in the Bay Area, but this place was pretty decent. I ordered 2 rolls. The Poki Maki roll and also the crunch tempura roll. The Poki Maki was good, but I would say it's definitely too spicy for your average person. So if you do not love spicy food, this might not be the roll for you."
1239,"I've been slowly easing myself into eating raw fish, so I got their salmon & avocado maki. It was super delicious and fresh. I also got a large miso soup, which was indeed large (and good), so next time I will try to remember that I can't eat that much. :)"
