0,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
2,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
3,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
4,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
5,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
6,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
7,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
8,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
9,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
10,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
11,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
12,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
13,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
14,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
15,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
16,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
17,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
18,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
19,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
20,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake.

My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
35,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
36,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
37,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
38,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
39,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
40,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
41,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
42,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
43,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
44,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
45,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
46,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
47,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
48,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
49,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
50,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
51,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
52,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
53,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
54,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake.

71,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
72,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
73,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
74,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
75,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
76,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
77,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
78,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
79,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
80,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
81,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
82,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
83,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
84,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
85,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
86,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
87,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
88,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
89,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
90,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"

It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
106,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
107,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
108,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
109,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
110,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
111,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
112,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
113,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
114,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
115,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
116,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
117,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
118,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
119,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
120,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
121,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
122,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
123,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
124,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
125,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast.

While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
141,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
142,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
143,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
144,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
145,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
146,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
147,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
148,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
149,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
150,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
151,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
152,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
153,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
154,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
155,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
156,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
157,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
158,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
159,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
160,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake.

My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
175,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
176,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
177,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
178,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
179,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
180,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
181,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
182,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
183,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
184,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
185,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
186,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
187,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
188,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
189,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
190,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
191,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
192,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
193,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
194,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake.

I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
211,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
212,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
213,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
214,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
215,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
216,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
217,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
218,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
219,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
220,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
221,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
222,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
223,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
224,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
225,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
226,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
227,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
228,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
229,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
230,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway.

To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
246,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
247,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
248,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
249,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
250,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
251,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
252,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
253,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
254,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
255,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
256,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
257,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
258,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
259,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
260,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
261,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
262,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
263,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
264,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
265,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup.

280,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
281,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
282,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
283,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
284,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
285,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
286,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
287,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
288,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
289,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
290,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
291,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
292,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
293,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
294,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
295,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
296,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
297,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
298,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
299,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"

So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
315,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
316,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
317,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
318,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
319,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
320,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
321,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
322,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
323,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
324,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
325,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
326,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
327,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
328,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
329,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
330,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
331,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
332,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
333,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."

Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
351,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
352,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
353,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
354,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
355,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
356,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
357,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
358,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
359,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
360,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
361,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
362,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
363,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
364,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
365,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
366,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
367,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
368,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
369,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"

The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
386,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
387,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
388,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
389,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
390,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
391,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
392,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
393,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
394,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
395,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
396,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
397,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
398,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
399,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
400,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
401,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
402,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
403,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
404,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
405,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more.

Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
420,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
421,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
422,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
423,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
424,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
425,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
426,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
427,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
428,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
429,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
430,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
431,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
432,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
433,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
434,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
435,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
436,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
437,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
438,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
439,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me).

454,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
455,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
456,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
457,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
458,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
459,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
460,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
461,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
462,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
463,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
464,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
465,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
466,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
467,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
468,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
469,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
470,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
471,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
472,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
473,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time.

The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
490,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
491,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
492,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
493,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
494,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
495,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
496,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
497,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
498,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
499,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
500,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
501,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
502,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
503,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
504,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
505,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
506,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
507,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
508,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
509,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette.

From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
526,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
527,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
528,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
529,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
530,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
531,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
532,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
533,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
534,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
535,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
536,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
537,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
538,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
539,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
540,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
541,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
542,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
543,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
544,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."

The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
560,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
561,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
562,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
563,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
564,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
565,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
566,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
567,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
568,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
569,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
570,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
571,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
572,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
573,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
574,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
575,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
576,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
577,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
578,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
579,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection!

Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
594,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
595,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
596,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
597,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
598,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
599,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
600,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
601,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
602,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
603,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
604,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
605,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
606,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
607,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
608,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
609,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
610,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
611,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
612,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
613,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy.

I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
630,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
631,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
632,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
633,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
634,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
635,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
636,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
637,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
638,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
639,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
640,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
641,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
642,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
643,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
644,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
645,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
646,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
647,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
648,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"

There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
665,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
666,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
667,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
668,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
669,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
670,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
671,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
672,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
673,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
674,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
675,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
676,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
677,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
678,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
679,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
680,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
681,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
682,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
683,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
684,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food.

I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
700,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
701,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
702,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
703,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
704,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
705,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
706,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
707,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
708,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
709,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
710,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
711,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
712,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
713,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
714,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
715,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
716,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
717,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
718,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
719,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line.

I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
734,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
735,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
736,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
737,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
738,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
739,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
740,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
741,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
742,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
743,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
744,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
745,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
746,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
747,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
748,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
749,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
750,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
751,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
752,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."

769,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
770,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
771,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
772,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
773,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
774,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
775,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
776,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
777,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
778,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
779,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
780,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
781,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
782,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
783,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
784,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
785,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
786,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
787,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
788,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her!

I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
805,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
806,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
807,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
808,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
809,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
810,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
811,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
812,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
813,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
814,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
815,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
816,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
817,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
818,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
819,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
820,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
821,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
822,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"

I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
839,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
840,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
841,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
842,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
843,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
844,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
845,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
846,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
847,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
848,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
849,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
850,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
851,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
852,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
853,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
854,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
855,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
856,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
857,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
858,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg!

Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
873,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
874,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
875,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
876,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
877,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
878,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
879,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
880,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
881,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
882,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
883,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
884,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
885,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
886,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
887,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
888,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
889,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
890,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
891,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
892,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28.

Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
909,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
910,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
911,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
912,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
913,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
914,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
915,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
916,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
917,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
918,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
919,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
920,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
921,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
922,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
923,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
924,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
925,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
926,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
927,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."

Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
943,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
944,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
945,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
946,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
947,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
948,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
949,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
950,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
951,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
952,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
953,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
954,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
955,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
956,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
957,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
958,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
959,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
960,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
961,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
962,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line.

The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
978,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
979,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
980,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
981,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
982,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
983,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
984,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
985,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
986,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
987,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
988,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
989,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
990,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
991,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
992,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
993,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
994,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
995,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
996,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
997,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get.

After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1013,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1014,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1015,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1016,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1017,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1018,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1019,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1020,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1021,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1022,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1023,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1024,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1025,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1026,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1027,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1028,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1029,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1030,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1031,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1032,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome.

Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1048,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1049,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1050,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1051,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1052,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1053,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1054,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1055,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1056,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1057,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1058,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1059,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1060,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1061,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1062,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1063,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1064,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1065,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1066,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1067,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste.

Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1083,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1084,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1085,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1086,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1087,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1088,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1089,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1090,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1091,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1092,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1093,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1094,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1095,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1096,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1097,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1098,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1099,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1100,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1101,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."

These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1116,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1117,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1118,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1119,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1120,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1121,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1122,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1123,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1124,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1125,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1126,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1127,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1128,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1129,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1130,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1131,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1132,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1133,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1134,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1135,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food.

So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1152,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1153,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1154,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1155,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1156,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1157,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1158,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1159,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1160,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1161,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1162,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1163,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1164,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1165,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1166,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1167,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1168,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1169,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1170,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1171,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early.

1186,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1187,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1188,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1189,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1190,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1191,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1192,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1193,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1194,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1195,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1196,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1197,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1198,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1199,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1200,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1201,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1202,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1203,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1204,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1205,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."

It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1221,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1222,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1223,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1224,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1225,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1226,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1227,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1228,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1229,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1230,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1231,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1232,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1233,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1234,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1235,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1236,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1237,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1238,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1239,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1240,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy!

My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1255,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1256,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1257,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1258,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1259,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1260,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1261,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1262,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1263,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1264,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1265,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1266,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1267,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1268,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1269,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1270,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1271,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1272,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1273,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1274,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake.

The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1291,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1292,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1293,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1294,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1295,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1296,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1297,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1298,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1299,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1300,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1301,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1302,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1303,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1304,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1305,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1306,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1307,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1308,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1309,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1310,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush.

The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1326,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1327,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1328,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1329,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1330,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1331,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1332,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1333,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1334,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1335,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1336,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1337,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1338,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1339,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1340,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1341,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1342,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1343,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1344,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1345,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more.

Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1360,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1361,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1362,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1363,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1364,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1365,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1366,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1367,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1368,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1369,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1370,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1371,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1372,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1373,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1374,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1375,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1376,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1377,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1378,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1379,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me).

Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1394,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1395,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1396,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1397,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1398,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1399,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1400,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1401,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1402,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1403,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1404,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1405,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1406,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1407,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1408,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1409,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1410,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1411,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1412,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1413,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy.

I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1430,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1431,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1432,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1433,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1434,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1435,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1436,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1437,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1438,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1439,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1440,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1441,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1442,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1443,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1444,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1445,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1446,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1447,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1448,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"

They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1465,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1466,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1467,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1468,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1469,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1470,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1471,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1472,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1473,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1474,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1475,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1476,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1477,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1478,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1479,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1480,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1481,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1482,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1483,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."

1499,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1500,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1501,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1502,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1503,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1504,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1505,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1506,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1507,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1508,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1509,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1510,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1511,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1512,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1513,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1514,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1515,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1516,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1517,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1518,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."

Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1533,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1534,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1535,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1536,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1537,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1538,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1539,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1540,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1541,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1542,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1543,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1544,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1545,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1546,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1547,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1548,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1549,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1550,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1551,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1552,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise.

The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1569,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1570,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1571,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1572,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1573,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1574,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1575,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1576,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1577,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1578,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1579,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1580,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1581,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1582,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1583,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1584,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1585,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1586,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1587,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."

Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1603,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1604,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1605,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1606,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1607,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1608,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1609,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1610,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1611,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1612,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1613,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1614,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1615,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1616,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1617,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1618,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1619,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1620,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1621,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1622,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line.

Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1638,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1639,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1640,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1641,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1642,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1643,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1644,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1645,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1646,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1647,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1648,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1649,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1650,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1651,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
1652,"Came to Bette's with my friend around 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We got lucky and found metered parking right across the street! According to other reviews, parking was a pain. Anyway, we entered Bette's and the place was packed and lively.The guy at the front register seemed a little irritated at how busy it was. Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1653,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1654,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1655,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"

Also seemed annoyed at the fact that we asked to sit outside and he had to explain to us that if we wanted to sit there, we'd have to order from the to-go side. No eye contact, no smile, no welcome. Whatever, not a big deal I guess, ended up getting seated at the bar.We were asked immediately if we wanted any drinks and we started off with water. After looking over their menu, I ordered a small orange juice and the Banana Rum Soufflé pancake, and my friend ordered a coffee and the Apple Brandy Soufflé pancake.My orange juice was great, my pancake looked impressive and was delightfully fluffy, but there honestly wasn't a wow-factor for me. I wish I had ordered a side of bacon and eggs and fruit or something. My friend had had better coffee but it didn't seem to bother her much. She enjoyed her pancake and was just as impressed by the production of it as I was. Our pancakes were $15 each and our coffee and OJ were $2.75 each. Plus tax, our bill ended up at about $40.28. Reasonable, no complaints. I'd like to come back and try some different items on their menu because they looked great. Overall, service was alright (we did love one lady wearing pink who just came by to pick up our dishes when we were finished), and the food was good and filling but I've had a more satisfying meal taste wise. Hopefully next time I'll feel more welcomed haha."
1673,"I guess I expected more based on the rave reviews and big lines. I came around 2 pm after a bridal appointment with my sister. We were seated immediately. Our server was very quick, perhaps a little pushy (barely got any time to read the menu) but it was close to closing time so I understand. I ordered the Maryland breakfast and my sister got the Reuben sandwich with coleslaw. I wanted a cream scone as my side but they were out so I settled for toast :( Our food came out pretty quickly. My hash was pretty tasteless and mushy, it needed more seasoning and longer cooking. The toast also came pre-buttered and was pretty soggy. Not particularly impressed with my meal.My sister's Reuben was pretty good. She liked the coleslaw and the sandwich was not bad.I'll probably revisit again and give them another try next time. I feel like my mediocre experience is not reflective of what they're capable of."
1674,"Apparently, my mom said Guy Fieri visited this place and raved about their soufflé pancakes - sooo of course we had to give this place a try before dropping my brother off at school.We were prepared to wait a while, since everyone complained about their hour long lines. So we showed up at 8:15 and surprisingly got seated 15 minutes later! Inside it is very small and packed. It kind of reminds me of Johnny Rockets with the juke box and old fashioned seats! The breakfast menu is served all day and doesn't have many options. We ordered their banana rum soufflé pancake, two orders of eggs with ham or chicken apple sausage, and their special of the day; veggie hash. It took such a loooong time for our food to get to us. When  the food finally came I was surprised at how small the portion size was. The pancake I feel is over hyped. Yes, it's soft and the texture is different, but it tastes like any other pancake. My veggie hash was pretty good. It had celery root, shiitake mushrooms, and squash mixed in with the potatoes and topped with two poached eggs. I finished it..but I left the place still feeling a little hungry. Overall: I definitely won't wait an hour to eat here...and probably won't come back because I feel there's better breakfast places in Berkeley...that are also cheaper with bigger portions haha."
1675,"Expect long waits that make you think twice, but you'll regret walking away from Bette's. The massive slice of pie looming over your head and a white and black tile floor lets you know you're in for some good eating, with a fun twist and good vibes- as would be expected from anything in Berkeley. There's a blending of elements happening here- a little retro, a little Californian, and a little international, that translate into totally yummy comfort food. I was there for a late Brunch on a Sunday, which seemed to cut down on the wait time.Our food was delivered quickly by our friendly server. Blood Orange MimosaGerman Pancakes w Sour Cream and Applesauce (like a better version of hash browns) Goat cheese & Red Bell Pepper on a baguetteBrunch was so good, I already picked out my next meal! These are only available during the week:FAMOUS MEATLOAF AND GRAVYServed with vegetables & mashed potatoes or home fries and mixed green salad (weekdays only)PASILLA CHICKEN SANDWICHSautéed chicken breast w/pasilla chiles & melted jack cheese on a baguette (weekdays only)"
1676,"Visiting from So Cal. My daughters boy friend recommended Bette's. I enjoyed my sever, the atmosphere and food. I'll return next time I'm in town. Reasonable prices too. I'm"
1677,"Bette's Oceanview is a fantastic little diner. There is street parking but it may take a little search and walking. At 10am on a Saturday the wait for a 2-person table is about 40 minutes so arrive early! I recommend one waits for the table while the other looks for parking. Also a lot of people waiting end up not showing so whatever time is quoted it usually ends up being less!I ordered the special: fried polenta with scrambled eggs and home fries. What came out was really surprising. This is real diner food except as sophisticated as it can get. The scrambled eggs had herbs, the polenta was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the home fries were just perfect and not too greasy. This is definitely the best breakfast I've had on the East Bay and I can't wait to come back.Next on my list is the soufflé pancakes!"
1678,"California - poached eggs, substituted bacon instead of ham, grilled tomatoes, home fries with onions and toast. The eggs were drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Omg! I am picky about hollandaise sauce and it's a hard sauce to get right. But this sauce was absolutely delish!Hubby had the herb omelette. He enjoyed it, but mentioned it could have been better if cooked with less oil/butter. Our glasses were never empty and the service was very friendly and prompt.Definitely a ""will do again"" meal and establishment."
1679,"For being an East Bay native, I can't believe this was my first time to Bette's. Well actually, I can because there is ALWAYS a line. This Berkeley classic boasts classic diner fare, has that old timey flare, and is fairly small inside! We got there around 12:30pm on a rainy weekday and were seated within about 20 minutes (we got lucky with the party in front of us leaving due to the wait). The menu is extensive. I ordered the California breakfast--two poached eggs over ham and toast topped with a lemon herb butter, served with grilled tomatoes, and home fries. Dang, it was delicious! The eggs were cooked perfectly and were sinful over the lemon butter soaked toast. The homefries are some of the best I have had--a blend of potatoes and onions, browned to perfection! The grilled tomatoes were good but the eggs took the show. A friend ordered the potato pancakes and they were very tasty. The short stack of pancakes did really live up to the hype (for me). Super fluffy and light and after having some I didn't feel weighed down. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the bacon was overly crisped for my liking, but if you are into that, it's great. Service was pretty solid. DIdn't feel super rushed at any point. And food came quickly. If you are craving dinner food and do not mind waiting, then Bette's is the place for you!"
1680,"We got here right when it opened at 6:30 AM on a Saturday! Totally worth it!My sister and I shared the Maryland breakfast platter and the banana rum soufflé pancake. The Maryland breakfast is absolutely delicious. It's a corned beef hash that comes with two perfectly poached eggs and toast. The corned beef is savory and flavorful without being too salty. The potatoes are cooked perfectly and I love the runny poached egg! Perfect to eat with the buttery toast. It's really really tasty. While we ate our breakfast plate, we waited for our banana rum soufflé, which takes a while longer (it says it takes longer on the menu). It took maybe about 20 min to cook which wasn't a long wait at all since we were busy devouring our corned beef! The soufflé pancake was light, airy, and surprisingly very rummy! The bananas are sweet while the actually pancake is not too sweet, which I really like. I was so stuffed, but it felt like I was eating delicious clouds, so I kept eating it! I would definitely recommend trying this at least once, it's one of their signature items on the menu!I would love to come back here and try other dishes. It's a cool diner which gets packed later in the day. If you really want to, it's nice going here right when it opens, to avoid a long wait time. It's worth waking up early for!"
1681,"Cranky waitresses & runny eggs. Not the best breakfast experience. A better customer-first attitude would definitely help bring this one-star rating higher. Once they got the order right, things went a little better."
1682,"I finally made it to Bette's after almost 8 months of being a Berkeley resident and 2.5 years living in the East Bay. Between the fear of long lines and never heading to 4th St. for brunch or lunch, I'm glad I checked it off the list.With that, I was expecting much more, but satisfied with what I got. Would I wait 2 hours? Hell no.It's a diner. Im a jersey girl, I know diners! I loved the fast paced atmosphere and it's loud and busy. Awesome. The menu consists of all the breakfast staples and lunch, and although Bette's is known for some certain items, I opted for a grilled chicken and pepper sandwich that's only served weekdays. And, it was solid, but not mind blowing.  The chicken didn't taste high quality, and it was on a big ole roll and nothing really stood out. I opted for potato salad as my side and again, nothing mind blowing. A nice amount of food and rings in at $12ish. Overall, a solid spot if you're looking for some regular eats in a fun and busy atmosphere. Id suggest coming at an off time to forgo the line. Next time I'll for sure check out their breakfast items and see if it's a bit more special, but until then, I'll consider Bette's as a hyped up diner!"
1683,"Came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and ran into Draymond Green!  That was dope.Food:  Not my favorite breakfast fare, but good nonetheless.  The corned beef hash is very tasty.  However, the souffle pancakes are a fun idea, but for me don't live up to expectations.Service:  A little harried, but friendly and helpful.Ambience/Decor:  Classic diner decor, located in a hip Berkeley neighborhood.  Make no mistake, it is BUSY, so there will be a wait."
1684,"This place is small and packed. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table. I have to say, they have the best pancakes in California. I forgot to take a picture of it but it was so buttery and fluffy. There's a big parking lot across the street so it's very convenient to get to. They also own the coffee shop next door so it was great getting coffee and sitting in the patio waiting for our table inside. If you purchase coffee in the coffee shop, they will give you refills in the restaurant while you eat your breakfast. They also have open kitchen so you can watch them make your food. There's even a  jukebox to choose songs while you wait for your food. I think it was $0.10 for one song and $0.25 for three songs. It was so fun eating here."
1685,"Food 3/5. Service 3/5. Ambiance 4/5.I was just expecting more. From the two times I have went here, the food is good for what breakfast food is, but it isn't worth while enough to warrant the long waits to get a table. There is seating inside and out but the seating is rather limited. If you have a big group of people, good luck waiting for two tables open up so they can combine them. The ambiance is like a old diner, with all the aspects that brings back nostalgia and memories. Their main sweet breakfast item is the soufflé that takes longer to cook than most items here. I wasn't too sure of what I was expecting but I was excited to dive into mine when I saw how fluffy the soufflé was, topped with bananas. It also comes with a side of maple syrup. To me, the soufflé was bland and didn't taste like much. The maple syrup helped the soufflé but the overall texture just made it hard to finish the whole soufflé. The soufflé comes with seasonal fruit, as well. On the other hand, I thought the eggs benefit was delicious. On the menu it was called the California breakfast and it had poached eggs on ham & toast with a lemon-herb butter sauce, served with home fries & grilled tomatoes. It was the perfect amount for breakfast and everything went together well together.Overall, I would probably go to Bette's Oceanview if I was in the area for breakfast. Tips - Don't fall into the trap of getting a soufflé they are not good.Pros - excellent ambiance Cons - Host at the door can be rude and mean when asking for an ETA."
1686,"My parents discovered this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dines so since we were in Berkeley we had to check it out.  The guy calling everyone's party was so funny!  The line was crazy so we ended up waiting an hour.  I ordered the seasonal fruit souffle (peaches and blueberries).  It took awhile but it was worth it!  It was soft & fluffy & very filling.  If you're in Berkeley I highly recommend trying this restaurant for brunch despite the long wait."
1687,"I came her on Father's day breakfast and they were packed! Our host said a 25-60 minute wait for a party of 5 but we literally only waited 10 minutes.The waitress was quick with our drink order. The coffee was limitless, Everytime I thought I was going to finish it, it was repoured. My company and I all got breakfast options which came out at the same time. Service was just absolutely love absolutely great. (They had almond milk for a side!)I got the banana rum pancake souffle, and the Lox omelette. My company got the French toast with a side of fruit and avocado omelette. The food wasn't super amazing, it was average Diner breakfast food period but the banana rum souffle was delicious, it was Fluffy, made by egg whites, had real bananas inside of it and a sweet taste. Paired with maple syrup and butter it was delightful. The food to take a while but it was busy, and they brought it out for 5 people altogether. I'm on the fence about four or five stars to give this place so I'm just going to give for because my breakfast wasn't as amazing as I thought it was going to be.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1688,"Holy...... don't know where to even start....This is one of those restaurants that don't just offer great food. They got the whole experience goin! Came in during a birthday breakfast for the sister and they treated her like royyyyaaaaalllllttttyyyyyyy.We ended up with the BERRY SOUFFLÉ PANCAKE, SCRAPPLE (a delectable pork meatloaf thing), THE MARYLAND, and THE CALIFORNIA breakfasts. The food came out timely with the berry soufflé coming out at the very end. Usually speaking there's always something you order in a restaurant (even great ones) that's just kinda ehhh.....ok. You know a place is good BECAUSE IT HAS NO EHHHHHH. Both our breakfast plates were amazing with the eggs being poached perfectly on the top. The scrapple's appearance made it look like that ehhh kinda dish, but the flavor was surprisingly good.And the server surprised my sister with a cupcake and candle at the end!!!! So sweet of her! My sister and me were stuffed, but delighted. Don't let the wait time stop you from having the best breakfast experience in the Bay!!!!"
1689,"I been here 3 times already and there is always about an hour wait, so if you want to beat the rush, you would have to come early in the morning. I usually walk about the area, grab coffee at Artis, and be back just in time to be seated. This diner is famous for its soufflé pancakes. I've gotten one every time I've come and I usually order the seasonal fruit pancake. The last time I went I got the strawberry and blueberry soufflé pancake. I really enjoyed it, but it is definitely a dish I would have to share because it is a bit heavy. I also ordered a ham and cheese omelette, which was a French style omelette. The omelette's are light and airy and the potatoes it comes with are pretty good too.Friendly service too!"
1690,"Bettes was an awesome place to have breakfast. My girlfriend and I came here super early and managed to beat the rush. Shoutout to the person who posted a video of their Maryland breakfast, cutting through the egg with their butter knife and showing us the yolk flow beautifully down the potatoes. I tried to imitate it but my yolk wasn't as sexy lol. Anyway, I did go with the Maryland breakfast and it was delicious. The yolk could have been a little less cooked, but it was still acceptable and yummy.Service here is awesome because I love that diner experience. We sat at the bar but still have a server anyway. I forget his name but he helped us out in a prompt fashion and was knowledgeable it other dishes.One big plus that I always give to breakfast spots is coming for my coffee refill. If you bring me coffee, you get 5 stars. Lol"
1691,"We try to get to Bette's two or three times a year. It's always good and, at 7:30 AM, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table, so if you come much later (especially on a weekend) be prepared to wait. Good, solid food. All the basics. My wife had some sourdough pancakes, eggs and sausage; they were good, different, and very sour. In retrospect she would probably have preferred the traditional buttermilk ones, but this was a special and these are usually winners. I had the California breakfast which is some ham on some toast with two lovely poached eggs and a lemon-butter sauce, along with good potatoes and onions. Bette's coffee is excellent -- strong, tasty. The tab is reasonable. We were coming back from a SFO Airport run with our son and some of his friends and had been up super early. I have re-discovered the value of getting a FastTrak -- on the to do list! So by the time we were finished, we were too pooped to wait 90 minutes for the stores to open, though we had hoped to spend a good half of the day shopping in the cool air of the Bay. Parking on the street (meters) or behind Sur la Table or just down the street in a large lot across from Spengers Fresh Fish Grotto. Bette's is always worth a stop!"
