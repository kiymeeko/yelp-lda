0,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
1,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
2,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
3,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
4,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
5,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
6,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
7,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
8,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
9,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
10,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
11,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
12,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
13,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
14,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
15,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
16,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
17,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
18,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
19,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
20,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic.

48,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
49,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
50,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
51,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
52,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
53,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
54,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
55,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
56,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
57,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
58,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
59,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
60,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
61,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
62,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
63,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
64,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
65,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
66,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"

It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
99,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
100,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
101,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
102,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
103,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
104,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
105,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
106,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
107,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
108,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
109,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
110,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
111,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
112,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
113,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
114,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
115,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
116,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
117,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!

I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
147,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
148,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
149,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
150,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
151,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
152,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
153,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
154,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
155,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
156,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
157,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
158,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
159,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
160,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
161,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
162,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
163,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
164,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
165,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"

However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
196,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
197,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
198,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
199,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
200,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
201,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
202,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
203,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
204,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
205,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
206,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
207,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
208,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
209,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
210,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
211,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
212,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
213,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
214,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
215,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party.

245,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
246,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
247,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
248,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
249,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
250,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
251,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
252,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
253,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
254,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
255,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
256,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
257,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
258,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
259,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
260,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
261,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
262,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
263,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
264,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."

I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
295,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
296,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
297,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
298,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
299,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
300,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
301,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
302,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
303,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
304,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
305,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
306,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
307,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
308,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
309,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
310,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
311,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
312,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
313,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
314,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down.

344,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
345,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
346,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
347,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
348,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
349,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
350,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
351,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
352,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
353,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
354,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
355,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
356,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
357,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
358,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
359,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
360,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
361,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
362,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
363,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"

After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
393,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
394,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
395,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
396,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
397,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
398,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
399,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
400,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
401,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
402,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
403,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
404,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
405,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
406,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
407,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
408,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
409,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
410,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
411,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
412,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight!

Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
444,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
445,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
446,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
447,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
448,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
449,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
450,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
451,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
452,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
453,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
454,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
455,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
456,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
457,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
458,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
459,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
460,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
461,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
462,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
463,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish).

491,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
492,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
493,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
494,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
495,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
496,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
497,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
498,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
499,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
500,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
501,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
502,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
503,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
504,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
505,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
506,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
507,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
508,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
509,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."

It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
542,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
543,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
544,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
545,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
546,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
547,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
548,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
549,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
550,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
551,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
552,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
553,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
554,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
555,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
556,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
557,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
558,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
559,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
560,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"

This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
590,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
591,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
592,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
593,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
594,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
595,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
596,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
597,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
598,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
599,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
600,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
601,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
602,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
603,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
604,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
605,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
606,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
607,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
608,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
609,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate.

For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
641,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
642,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
643,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
644,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
645,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
646,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
647,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
648,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
649,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
650,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
651,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
652,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
653,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
654,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
655,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
656,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
657,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
658,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
659,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."

688,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
689,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
690,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
691,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
692,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
693,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
694,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
695,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
696,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
697,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
698,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
699,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
700,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
701,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
702,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
703,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
704,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
705,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
706,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"

738,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
739,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
740,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
741,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
742,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
743,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
744,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
745,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
746,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
747,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
748,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
749,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
750,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
751,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
752,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
753,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
754,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
755,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
756,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
757,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!

786,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
787,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
788,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
789,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
790,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
791,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
792,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
793,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
794,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
795,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
796,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
797,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
798,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
799,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
800,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
801,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
802,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
803,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
804,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
805,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza.

We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
836,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
837,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
838,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
839,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
840,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
841,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
842,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
843,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
844,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
845,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
846,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
847,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
848,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
849,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
850,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
851,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
852,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
853,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
854,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."

They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
885,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
886,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
887,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
888,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
889,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
890,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
891,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
892,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
893,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
894,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
895,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
896,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
897,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
898,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
899,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
900,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
901,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
902,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
903,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
904,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood?

934,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
935,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
936,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
937,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
938,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
939,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
940,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
941,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
942,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
943,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
944,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
945,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
946,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
947,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
948,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
949,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
950,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
951,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
952,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."

I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
984,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
985,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
986,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
987,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
988,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
989,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
990,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
991,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
992,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
993,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
994,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
995,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
996,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
997,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
998,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
999,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
1000,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
1001,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
1002,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
1003,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby!

1032,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
1033,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
1034,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
1035,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
1036,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
1037,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
1038,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
1039,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
1040,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
1041,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
1042,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
1043,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
1044,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
1045,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
1046,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
1047,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
1048,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
1049,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."

1081,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
1082,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
1083,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
1084,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
1085,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
1086,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
1087,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
1088,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
1089,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
1090,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
1091,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
1092,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
1093,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
1094,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
1095,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
1096,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
1097,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
1098,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
1099,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
1100,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken.

My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
1130,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
1131,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
1132,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
1133,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
1134,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
1135,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
1136,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
1137,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
1138,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
1139,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
1140,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
1141,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
1142,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
1143,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
1144,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
1145,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
1146,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
1147,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."

It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
1180,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
1181,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
1182,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
1183,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
1184,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
1185,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
1186,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
1187,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
1188,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
1189,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
1190,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
1191,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
1192,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
1193,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
1194,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
1195,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
1196,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
1197,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
1198,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
1199,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off.

1227,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
1228,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
1229,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
1230,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
1231,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
1232,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
1233,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
1234,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
1235,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
1236,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
1237,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
1238,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
1239,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
1240,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
1241,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
1242,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
1243,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
1244,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
1245,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
1246,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes.

1278,"The go-to place if:- you're starving- you want Italian food - you're studying and need sustenance- you're drunk AF - you have the munchies- you want to share your food- you want to carbo load- you like pasta- you don't want to walk more than 2 blocks from campus to drive your late night studying- you want to spend under $10 on a meal - you want your food steaming hot  - you like roasted garlic + bread- you like getting discounts when paying with cash- you like eating leftovers - you want some quick food to go- you need to eat something before heavily drinking Get the shrimp alfredo if you like shrimp! It's sooo goood. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, enough for each bite :) Godfather's favorite is also good. Calzones are HUGE. It ain't gourmet, but you will be satisfied if you eat here."
1279,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while and tonight, I've finally checked it off. Hubby and I decided to keep our early V-day celebration, simple and casual so off we went and the place was busy and we were surrounded by college kids. The line was consistently long but it moved quickly. It was crowded but we were able to snag a table. How it works:- Wait in line (if there's one) - Order your food (dine-in or take out) - Seat yourself at any table or counter seats available (there are also plenty of tables outside) - Wait for your number to be called and pick up at the front next to the register- EnjoyWe ordered Gypsy Chicken and Godfather's Favorite (plus I added shrimp). It is very affordable and they have a price difference if paying with cash or credit ($1 less with cash). The food was delicious and they're generous with their portions. Everything on the menu looks good so I'm looking to try other dishes when I come back."
1280,"Italian food quick, cheap, delicious. Alright first things first I feel like Italian food gets the most criticism for not being the most authentic. So I will say this is based on the understanding that this is an American Italian restaurant! Located in what is known by some locals as the ""Asian Ghetto"" Gypsys is a no non sense, hearty Italian style food. For around $10 you can get any of their pasta dishes with an included slice of bread. They also offer ginormous calzones for $8. My sister and I were pretty hungry so made the mistake of ordering our own dish. I would probably recommend sharing their pastas but at such a great deal you can't go wrong with having left overs. I went for the God Father and my sister recommended going with Linguine pasta. They don't skimp at all on the pancetta and amount of chicken. The alfredo sauce is pretty rich so I'd consider one of the tomato based sauces if you aren't interested in a more heavy sauce. If you're student in the area in need of a quick meal (or two) this is the best place to stretch your dollar!"
1281,"I used to always come to Gypsy's for huge portions of comfort food.Their pastas are solid, but my go to was the calzones. They're really big and have a good amount of toppings. It's great that they're open late, and I can't believe they've remained open after all these years (like most of the places in the Asian ghetto). I'm glad they're still around.  They take credit cards now, but it's cheaper with cash."
1282,"Gypsy's ALWAYS  hits the spot! I always leave here satisfied! I ordered the crazy alfredo. It comes with chicken, bell peppers, and sausage. I love how they give you a  generous amount of chicken and sausage and  the pasta is cooked perfectly. To top it off, the creamy tomato sauce has great flavor. The portions are also HUGE, definitely worth $10.  I recommend bringing cash since they charge you more for card.Pro tip #1: Try the Godfather with linguini instead of penne! You can switch out any dish with a different pasta."
1283,"Gypsy's is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!!! You get such great pasta for a really reasonable price (~$10 per dish). Lines can get pretty long during peak hours (lunch/dinner/late night hours), but that just shows that this place is bomb. My favorites are:Pollo con pesto: Linguine with chicken and pestoGodfather's favorite: Penne pasta with a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, and other goodiesShrimp alfredo: Linguine with alfredo sauce and mushrooms and shrimpPortions are really generous and come with garlic bread. I usually can't finish an entire plate of their pasta so I get it to go and eat the other half another day. I also got the calzone once and it was HUGE. It was the size of a baby! Honestly I'd say this is the best Italian restaurant in Berkeley based on its affordability and taste. I really don't have much to say about this place because it's just so good and everyone needs to try it out!!Also, some dishes are cheaper with cash, so if you can, pay in cash!!!"
1284,"I have been here twice and I have loved each visit! The first time I got the chicken piccata, so tasty and such a good portion for the price! This last time I went with the chicken Marsala, it did not disappoint! Both the sauces tasted great, I wish they were a little thicker but now I'm being picky because I know the food is good. This place is has two prices for everything, one is the cash price and the other is a card charge. Do yourself a favor and bring cash, it will save you a couple of cents. There is always a line, gotta respect their hustle, they are flying back there making food as quickly as possible. What I love most is how much variety they have in the menus. Want seafood? They got it! Vegetarian? Check! Salad? Also check. You can't go wrong with tasty affordable food."
1285,"This restaurant is A W E S O M E!!! There's always a long line out the door and the place is packed full of people at every moment of the day. Despite the long wait, the cheap pasta here is amazingly delicious and will surely fill you up! Each pasta dish is around $8-$10 whereas the seafood dishes could range from $12-$13. The pizzas here are also very very fulfilling!!! My boyfriend and I always get The Godfather's Favorite, the Crazy Alfredo, the Frutti Del Mar, and the pepperoni/sausage pizza. Just writing this review makes me excited to go back!! I definitely come here wayyyy too often. I highly recommend this place if you're searching for cheap pasta and a place that opens until 2am!!"
1286,"Dang. I didn't know cheap pasta could be so GOOD. I've never seen the concept of Italian fast food but Gypsy's pulls it off strikingly well.You basically wait in a line that goes out the door, then when you reach the counter, you order your food and wait. Keep in mind that if you use card you have to pay 50 cents more. They have an ATM machine inside, but paying with card at the counter might be more worth it than having to pay a bigger fee to use the ATM. Prices for pasta range from $8-$11.My boyfriend and I got the seafood scampi and the pollo Gorgonzola. The type of pasta is already set it the menu item; I'm not sure you can ask for substitutes. Both were mind-blowing delicious!! One plate is a good amount for one person. The pasta also comes with a slice of bread, so prepare to carb up.I wish a place like this existed in San Diego. If I lived in Berkeley, I would come here ALL the time to try everything on the menu!"
1287,"I went to Gypsy's after the engineering commencement with one of the graduates, her family, and her friends.  There was 8 of us total and I worried there would be an issue finding a table but we were able to pull two tables together to seat us all.  After our orders were put in, it didn't take long for our meal to come out.I ordered my go-to which is the Bronx Tale (meatball, sausage, and pasta) which comes with a piece a bread with a smushed roasted piece of garlic.  Add on some cheese and pepper and this dish is ready to go for me.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes.  My friend's brother noted how big the meatballs were and how it actually had flavor.  I had to agree that Gypsy's meatballs are about half the size of my fist and definitely have flavor and moistness despite the size.  Often times meatballs of this size are dry or tasteless so definitely a winner.While we were wrapping up the dinner, one of the employees came to see if we needed any to go boxes or bags which I thought was really nice.  All in all, a nice way to end such a momentous day.Downsides: No public restroom (though I don't think any of the restaurants in the Asian Ghetto have one) and street parking is terrible since it's off of Telegraph."
1288,Definitely a HOT SPOT!! Line always out the door but worth the wait! Stays open pretty late if you want something good late night! I LOVE pasta so this will always be my #1 recommendation to some one looking for good pasta & salad!
1289,"The Food: This place is hands down one of my fave in the area. I got the pancetta pasta and the pollo con pesto (chicken and pesto) and boy did I enjoy eating this. I made love to the plate. My eyes dialated at the sight of the pesto slathered on that dirty dirty chicken... oh my my breath sputtered and my tongue slicked... oh and the whole experience only cost about 10.60, sooooo worth it. The location: The restaurant is in the middle of the main Berkeley campus area... it's full of college students and people visiting the season all the time. This place always has a line and is semi full... parking can suck but it's a risk worth taking. Seats can be cumbersome to find but you'll find one... you need to sit while you eat this magical food full of wonder and joyness.The service: expect no less from the customer as the expect no less from their food. Read the menu order what you want and don't make it complicated. If you ordered extra shit in your calzone... it's gonna take longer to cook sooooo chill. They call your number and you get your food. They don't wait here,  but they are willing to help you with any request. No waiting just pick up your food, eat and get out."
1290,"Pollo con pesto is my favorite. They have generous servings, and the orders usually come up pretty fast. But sometimes it can get crowded with a lot of college students. Their seafood is pretty fresh also. Very high quality ingredients."
1291,Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall: was pretty average and not sure I'd be back.The extended details...Food:The Bronx tale - I got this and the portion was sort of small in my mind.  Sauce was ok but didn't really taste fresh to me.  There were bits of sausage and maybe a couple of full meatballs.Service: a pretty long line and it goes fairly quickly but it's more a take out place.Ambiance: it's kind of like cafeteria style but makes sense since it's in the heart of telegraph
1292,"The best pasta for the best price.  You probably can't beat the price of this pasta that taste so good anywhere else.  I wish it wasn't so far from me, but it's probably a good thing because I would gain so much weight! You have to order first and then sit down. After you order they will call out your number and you can choose to sit inside or outside - just bring back your tray/dirty dishes afterwards. :) Both times I came here I got the chicken pesto pasta. I love everything about the pasta - they give you a lot of the pasta and the sauce. So delicious!  They also give you garlic bread to go with the pasta and I love to dip the bread in the sauce. Definitely recommend coming here for pasta."
1293,The Godfather's Favorite is hands down my favorite Pasta. Calzones  are a really good size too!Usually get both and split it with a friend! Yummy and quick pasta! Try it if you're in town promise it's good!
1294,"This is one of my favorite Italian places in the Berkeley area! I would rate 5 stars, but the line to order is always super long and there's never really enough space to sit down. If you come here, make sure to not come during prime dinner time because the line will wrap all around the front of the restaurant! I've so far ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capricciosa, and Pollo Con Pesto. Every time I come here and try a different dish, I love it. The pasta is always rich with flavor (I'm a huge fan of a lot of sauce and they always put a lot!), and the portion size is huge. I always have enough left over to satisfy me for the next meal. All the menu items look so good, and I'm so excited to try all of them! Overall, food is great but the line to order and wait for the food is atrocious so 4/5 stars."
1295,"We ordered take out from this place for our daughter graduation party. We were very satisfied with the tasty foods and the foods were ready at the time they told us to pick up.  They didn't miss any of the 15 items that were ordered. However, it's hard to find parking and this tiny little place is so uncomfortable to stand in line just to pay and pick up foods."
1296,"Nothing to complain about here, real Italian food being served. Came on a Sunday nice and got our meal pretty quick, after we ordered around 6:30 the line started to get pretty heavy. The Godfather and the pesto fettuccini were excellent. The pasta was soft and the sauces were great. The garlic bread that came with it had whole roasted garlic on top, definitely a treat"
1297,First time today and ordered the chicken and broccoli! Super creamy and delicious. Definitely am going to come back!
