0,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
2,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
3,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
4,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
5,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
6,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
7,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
8,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
9,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
10,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
11,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
12,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
13,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
14,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
15,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
16,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
17,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
18,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
19,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
44,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
45,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
46,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
47,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
48,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
49,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
50,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
51,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
52,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
53,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
54,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
55,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
56,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
57,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
58,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
59,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

61,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
62,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total.

As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
86,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
87,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
88,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
89,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
90,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
91,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
92,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
93,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
94,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
95,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
96,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
97,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
98,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
99,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

101,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
102,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
103,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
104,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style.

Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
128,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
129,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
130,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
131,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
132,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
133,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
134,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
135,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
136,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
137,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
138,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
139,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

141,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
142,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
143,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
144,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
145,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"

172,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
173,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
174,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
175,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
176,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
177,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
178,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
179,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

181,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
182,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
183,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
184,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
185,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
186,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
187,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
188,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$.

214,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
215,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
216,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
217,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
218,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
219,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

221,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
222,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
223,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
224,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
225,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
226,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
227,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
228,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
229,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
230,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
231,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
232,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
233,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system.

In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get.

Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
256,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
257,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
258,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
259,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
260,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
261,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
262,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
263,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
264,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
265,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
266,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
267,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
268,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
269,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
270,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
271,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
272,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
273,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush.

Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
274,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
275,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited.

297,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
298,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
299,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
300,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
301,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
302,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
303,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
304,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
305,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
306,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
307,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
308,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
309,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
310,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
311,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
312,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
313,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
314,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
315,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
316,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes.

341,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
342,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
343,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
344,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
345,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
346,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
347,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
348,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
349,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
350,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
351,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
352,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
353,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
354,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
355,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
356,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
357,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
358,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
359,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
384,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
385,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
386,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
387,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
388,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
389,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
390,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
391,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
392,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
393,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
394,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
395,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
396,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
397,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
398,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
399,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

401,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
402,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total.

So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa.

426,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
427,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
428,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
429,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
430,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
431,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
432,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
433,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
434,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
435,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
436,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
437,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
438,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
439,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

441,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
442,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
443,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
444,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura.

Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
467,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
468,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
469,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
470,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
471,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
472,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
473,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
474,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
475,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
476,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
477,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
478,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
479,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

481,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
482,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
483,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
484,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."

The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa.

510,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
511,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
512,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
513,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
514,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
515,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
516,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
517,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
518,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
519,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

521,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
522,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
523,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
524,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
525,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
526,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
527,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
528,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$.

554,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
555,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
556,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
557,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
558,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
559,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

561,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
562,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
563,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
564,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
565,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
566,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
567,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
568,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
569,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
570,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
571,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
572,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."

While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
596,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
597,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
598,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
599,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
600,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
601,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
602,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
603,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
604,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
605,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
606,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
607,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
608,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
609,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
610,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
611,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
612,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
613,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele.

614,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."

Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
637,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
638,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
639,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
640,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
641,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
642,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
643,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
644,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
645,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
646,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
647,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
648,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
649,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
650,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
651,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
652,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
653,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
654,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
655,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"

680,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
681,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
682,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
683,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
684,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
685,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
686,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
687,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
688,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
689,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
690,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
691,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
692,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
693,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
694,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
695,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
696,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
697,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N.

698,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy.

It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
723,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
724,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
725,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
726,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
727,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
728,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
729,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
730,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
731,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
732,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
733,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
734,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
735,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
736,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
737,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
738,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
739,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

741,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."

I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
765,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
766,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
767,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
768,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
769,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
770,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
771,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
772,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
773,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
774,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
775,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
776,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
777,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
778,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
779,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

781,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
782,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
783,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"

806,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
807,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
808,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
809,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
810,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
811,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
812,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
813,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
814,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
815,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
816,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
817,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
818,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
819,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

821,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
822,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
823,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
824,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."

849,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
850,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
851,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
852,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
853,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
854,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
855,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
856,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
857,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
858,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
859,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

861,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
862,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
863,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
864,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
865,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
866,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
867,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
868,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant.

The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
894,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
895,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
896,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
897,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
898,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
899,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

901,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
902,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
903,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
904,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
905,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
906,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
907,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
908,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
909,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
910,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
911,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
912,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday.

935,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
936,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
937,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
938,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
939,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
940,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
941,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
942,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
943,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
944,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
945,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
946,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
947,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
948,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
949,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
950,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
951,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
952,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
953,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system.

In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections.

954,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice.

And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
977,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
978,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
979,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
980,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
981,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
982,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
983,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
984,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
985,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
986,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
987,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
988,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
989,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
990,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
991,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
992,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
993,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
994,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
995,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"

Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1019,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
1020,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1021,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1022,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1023,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1024,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1025,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1026,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1027,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1028,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1029,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1030,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1031,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1032,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1033,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1034,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1035,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1036,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."

All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1063,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1064,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1065,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1066,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1067,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1068,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1069,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1070,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1071,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1072,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1073,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1074,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1075,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1076,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."

1078,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1079,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1104,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1105,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1106,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1107,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1108,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1109,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1110,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1111,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1112,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1113,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1114,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1115,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1116,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1117,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N.

1118,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1119,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1121,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."

All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total.

Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa.

1146,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1147,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1148,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1149,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1150,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1151,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1152,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1153,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1154,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1155,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1156,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1157,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N.

1158,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1159,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1161,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."

All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1163,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1164,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt.

1187,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1188,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1189,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1190,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1191,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1192,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1193,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1194,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1195,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1196,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1197,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1198,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1199,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1201,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1202,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1203,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1204,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B.

1231,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1232,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1233,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1234,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1235,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1236,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1237,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N.

1238,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1239,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1241,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1242,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1243,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1244,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B.

The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa.

1247,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures).

The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1274,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1275,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1276,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1277,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1278,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1279,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1281,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1282,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1283,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1284,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1285,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry.

1286,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1287,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1288,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1289,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1290,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."

1315,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1316,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1317,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1318,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1319,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
1320,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1321,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1322,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1323,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1324,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1325,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry.

1326,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1327,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1328,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."

1330,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1331,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1332,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."

And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1357,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1358,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1359,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
1360,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1361,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1362,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1363,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1364,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1365,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1366,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1367,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1368,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1369,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1370,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1371,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1372,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1373,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)?

1374,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1375,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"

1399,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
1400,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush.

Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1401,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1402,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1403,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1404,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1405,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1406,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1407,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1408,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1409,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1410,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1411,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1412,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1413,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1414,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1415,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1416,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."

1442,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1443,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1444,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1445,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1446,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1447,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1448,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1449,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1450,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1451,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1452,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1453,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1454,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1455,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1456,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."

After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1484,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1485,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1486,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1487,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1488,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1489,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1490,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1491,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1492,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1493,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1494,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1495,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1496,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."

1498,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"

1501,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."

Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say.

Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa.

1526,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1527,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1528,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1529,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1530,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1531,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1532,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1533,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1534,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1535,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1536,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1537,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N.

1538,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1539,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1541,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."

All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1543,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1544,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt.

Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1567,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1568,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1569,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1570,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1571,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1572,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1573,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1574,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1575,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1576,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1577,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N.

1578,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1579,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1581,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."

All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1583,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1584,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B.

1609,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1610,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1611,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1612,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1613,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1614,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1615,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1616,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1617,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1618,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1619,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1621,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1622,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1623,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1624,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B.

So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry.

1627,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures).

Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1654,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1655,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1656,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1657,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1658,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1659,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1661,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1662,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1663,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1664,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1665,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry.

1666,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1667,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1668,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1669,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1670,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1671,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1672,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney.

There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1695,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1696,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1697,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1698,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1699,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
1700,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1701,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1702,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1703,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1704,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1705,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry.

1706,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1707,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1708,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."

1710,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1711,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1712,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney.

It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1736,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1737,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1738,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1739,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
1740,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1741,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1742,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1743,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1744,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1745,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry.

1746,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1747,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1748,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1749,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1750,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1751,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1752,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1753,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system.

In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections.

1754,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1755,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great.

California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1778,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1779,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
1780,"They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.Amazing Food. Super duper like.Will go back soon!!!"
1781,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1782,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1783,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1784,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1785,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1786,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1787,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1788,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1789,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1790,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1791,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1792,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1793,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)?

Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1794,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1795,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1796,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes.

1821,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1822,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1823,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1824,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1825,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1826,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1827,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1828,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1829,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1830,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1831,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1832,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1833,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1834,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1835,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1836,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."

1863,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1864,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1865,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1866,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1867,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1868,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1869,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1870,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1871,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1872,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1873,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1874,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1875,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1876,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."

1878,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1879,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1881,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like.

Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough.

I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
1905,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1906,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1907,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1908,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1909,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1910,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1911,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1912,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1913,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1914,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1915,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1916,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1917,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1918,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1919,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1921,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1922,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1923,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"

Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"
1946,"I am a little disappointed in visiting this place. Very unsafe neighborhood and food is good. We were visiting out of town and parked in the business parking lot. Though there are lots of signs stating that owners are not responsible for any loss or theft, it is discomforting to see that there are no surveillance cameras or local patrol to provide safety to visitors."
1947,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry. I'm doing a terrible job at explaining how yum it was but just trust me when I say go there. The only downside is that seating is a bit hard to find and I wish there was service instead of cafeteria style eating."
1948,"Vik's is an instant classic and one of the most heavily trafficked Indian spots in the Berkeley area. Vik's doubles as a market and an Indian restaurant. I haven't shopped at the market itself; this review is for the food. We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1949,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1950,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1951,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1952,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1953,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1954,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1955,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1956,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1957,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1958,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1959,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

1961,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
1962,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
1963,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
1964,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B.

We ordered chole bhature (9.00), idli sambhar (8.00), papdi chaat, dahi batata puri, mango lassi, masala dosa, and some sweets (I don't quite remember the prices of the remaining items). The food was fantastic; everything was fresh, made to order, and high quality. However, the portions were small and the prices were high. I know Yelp lists this as a $ but I'd put it down as a $$. Definitely a must visit spot if you're in the Berkeley area, and easily one of the best Indian spots in the Bay Area."
1989,"Gone are the good old days when an order of somosa cholle was $2.95! Lol these days the prices are about 3x higher than they were... however, the quality of the food is still phenomenal and tastes the same as it always has!"
1990,"One of my husbands favorite places when coming to Berkeley! You order and pay and then wait for your name. Very informal and the food is amazing! We had the puri, cholle bhature, and keema naan."
1991,I visited this place after maybe more then 6 months and noticed that quality and quantity were down.Prices for all eateries are jacked up.Don't think would return to this place again.
1992,"I got the sev puri (loved the combo of flavors and textures) and the samosa cholle which were more fried that I felt like but they came with a delicious side/sauce with garbanzos, cilantro, tamarind and a mint chutney. Both dishes were good - I'd definitely recommend the sev puri and I'd try something besides the samosas next time. Big seating area that was pretty empty at 4:30 on Monday. I bet it is packed in weekends when they have a bigger menu."
1993,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
1994,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
1995,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
1996,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
1997,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
1998,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
1999,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"

2001,"This place looks, feels and smells like India and it put a smile on my face. Seeing the old Indian grandmothers cooking got me more excited to try the food. I ordered the chicken curry plate and it was quite tasty. It actually had the flavour of a very home cooked Indian meal which is rare because other places usually make Indian food heavy. The roti was undercooked/ almost raw on my plate and I had to leave that unfortunately. That was a bummer. I also got 'Limca' to drink which is an Indian soft drink I really like. I will be back to try some of their other food and I do recommend this place when you crave home style Indian flavours."
2002,"We ordered:Curry chicken daily special,Tandori chicken daily special,Samosa lamb,DosaCame in around 11:15 Wed and waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered. All Food came after 6-10mins super quick! All the food was not steaming hot! No visible steam avail on any plate! Maybe it was due to us taking a few photos or the steel plates redirecting heat out of the food? Pros:Tandoori chicken was flavorful and soft but not moist enough. Curry chicken was good but pretty spicy and runny. Dosa moong (mung bean) was ordered but they gave veggie but was delicious. Best is lamb samosas!! Filled to the max with lamb and very flavorful!Cons:Did I mentioned all food was like warm! The basmati rice that came with both chicken plates were barely warm but pretty good tasting. It seems to me most of the food is from a steam table with exception of the Dosa crepes and samosas. I wonder if the majority of ingredients are non-gmo or organic? Menu doesn't say. Overall would come again but got to eat quicker or something since the food is only luke warm. All 4 plates came to be about $45 total. It seems not much but I did feel full maybe because of all the healthy spices I consumed instead of the amount of food."
2003,"Vik's Chaat is a cafeteria-style service Indian restaurant. There's always so many delicious possibilities on their menu! Just to be aware, their menu has different items on weekdays and weekends. Also, the weekends are really crowded but their table area is really spacious so don't be daunted. It honestly adds to the happy atmosphere.I find that this place really works with big groups because you can all order separately or together, whatever works and there's a lot of movable tables. After you order, they call out your name via a speaker, but it's good to keep an eye out as different foods will also come out of different areas of the counter. There's also a large variety of different foods such as vegetarian or nonvegetarian, and snack-size to meal-sizes which can help if there are dietary restrictions or different sized appetites.  One of my favorite things to get is the cholle bhature which comes out as a giant looking bread/pastry with in which you dip into the cholle (has chickpeas). Their mango lassi is a delicious addition as well! My friends are also fans of the curry meals that come on the metal trays.All in all, a delicious and unique place to go for some delicious Indian food (as my friend explained, it's also a different region of Indian cuisine than I normally have/think of)! To add to it, there's a large parking lot next door with an attached market as well!"
2004,"TL;DR super soft yummy naanI'm a novice in Indian food, and was overwhelmed by the extensive menu. With a recommendation from the cashier, I ended up getting a vegetarian dinner plate. I wasn't a big fan of the tofu/meat like chunks, but everything else was good. My favorite part was the naan, it was so so so soft and perfect with the curry and yogurt. I saw many others other a big fluffy thing, which I've learned is cholle bhatura. It looks so fun, warm, and welcoming, I would definitely get it if I were at Vik's again.The layout of the restaurant is cafeteria style. You order and pay at the counter, wait for your number to be called, and pick up at the counter. It's super spacious, and is also connected to the Grocery store, so you can grab your staples on your way out.Vik's is located near the Berkeley Marina, and is accessible by public transportation via AC Transit 51B. However, driving seems to be the safest and more efficient."
2005,"If you are around Berkeley and in a mood of having some tangy chaat, this place can satisfy your craving. It might seem to you that my statement contradicts my review rating, but I'd suggest you to keep reading.The ambiance is a bit hideous with a bright yellow paint but there was something that made me feel like I'm in India. As you enter the restaurant, you would first be entering their grocery store and then follows the restaurant. So, it is great if you need to pick a few items on your way back.We went for an early dinner on a weekend and this place was super packed. The queue was very long but the good part was that it kept moving quickly. We had Dahi Batata Puri and Sev Puri and both were really good! Just the right amount of spices, sweetness, and sourness makes a delicious chaat! Next, we ordered the weekend dinner specials which was their Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Thali. Each Thali came with Tandoori Roti or Naan, your choice of either veg/non-veg dish, Basmati Rice, Dal, Raita, pickle and a Sooji (semolina) halwa. The vegetarian dishes were so so and the rice was really dry. The dal was very tasty.To rate a couple of things out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2FOOD- 3    Dahi Batata Puri - 5    Sev Puri - 5    Vegetarian Thali - 2    Non-veg Thali - 4    Chole Bhature - 3CUSTOMER SERVICE - 4WAIT TIME - 4HYGIENE - 4"

2007,"I visited here for the first time today and it was amazing! The food was so good. I honestly do not remember what I got- I just know it was the big puffy thing meal (see pictures). Everyone at my table got something different. There was chicken, this amazing chickpea appetizer, and lots of curry.

2033,"Still not only the best chaat in the bay area, but possibly anywhere. Well anywhere outside of India.This is a popular Indian restaurant in Berkeley especially with the university crowd. There's tons of space inside with the order at one counter and pick up at another system. No table service.They have their own rather sizable parking lot, however regardless of how big it is, it can very nearly fill up during peak lunch/dinner times as this spot is really really popular. In case of emergency there is always side street parking in Berkeley, but whenever possible it's better to park in  Vik's parking lot.Unlike many other Indian restaurants the menu is not 20 pages long. Items are always good, but you cannot customize or order a la carte. What's on the menu is what you get. The menu is not strictly limited to chaat and while Dahi Papdi, Dahi Batata Puri, Dahi Pakori, Bhel Puri, Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Aloo Tikki may seem like a lot to chose from  typically dedicated chaat places will have more selections. There are other dishes available however including meat choicespsuch as biriyani.  the menu has been customized for the UC Berkeley clientele. As such this is not necessarily an authentic dining Indian experience per se. They have daily specials which are not repeated on other days. Do you like khema (lamb)? Better come on Tuesday or Thursday. Want the Idli? It's only available on weekends.The seating may be full during peak rush. Since the interior space can easily seat around one hundred people, this means you'll have to pay attention in order to hear your name called out when your order is ready as it can get a little noisy. Introverts are best advised to come in between the rush times.There is a small grocery attached which is clean, well organized and nicely laid out. Due to it's size it  does not carry many specialty items but will carry all the ingredients for the menu items made in the restaurant should you want to try making them at home."
2034,"I moved away from the Bay over a year ago, but I'm back often, and Vik's is one of my must-eats. They are popular for good reason: affordable, flavorful dishes with all kinds of spice. My favorite is the fish special, breaded and deep fried pieces of fish with a side of tangy sauce. The bhatura cholle (big puffy thing) is a staple dish, fun and tasty. There are several delicious dishes made with yogurt, which is almost like tasty gut medicine. Today I tried the lamb curry, which was also excellent, full of spices with a little kick. The cafeteria setting is part of Vik's charm, and there is a south Asian market connected to it if you want to take some ingredients home."
2035,"While parking is a struggle with only street-parking, it's definitely worth the hassle. Come early since tables are hard to find and line up orders can take over 15 to 20 minutes. After placing your order, listen out for your name as they call it out for pick-up on the other side. While it's usually busy and quite packed, the building is open and bright, and has plenty of natural light flooding the eating area. We came during lunch and their selection was rather limited. You're only left with a few meal options (lunch special, Dosa, Uttapam, Biryani) but a good selection of chaats (snacks/side dishes). The dinner menu offers more options. I strongly recommend ordering chaats with your meal. Their samosas are BOMB. It was served with cholle (chickpea gravy/sauce) and chutney that paired well. Have the samosa and cholle together (bite the top off the samosa and add the cholle in it). I also had their Mango Lassi (smoothie) and it tasted great. Not too sweet and not too heavy As someone who enjoys Hong-Kong style mango pudding, it replicates that same flavour in smoothie form. My friend and I ordered the biryanis. I prefer the lamb over chicken since the chicken was rather stale/dry. The rice was well spiced/seasoned (not too hot) and definitely add the raita (yogurt sauce) which helps cool the palate. It's meant to neutralize the spice since the spices can get overwhelming. The lamb was well cooked and tasted great with the spices. Included with both plates were a side of pickled mangoes. It has a strong sour and salty taste so I find that a hit or miss. But all-in-all, a great place for Indian food. Will definitely be back!"
2036,"I know I'm late to the game having been in the Bay Area for over a decade and only just now visiting Vik's Chaat! And after my visit I was really kicking myself for waiting so long.Cholle Bhatura ($9ish) - is a meal that's a big puffy fluffy ""bread"" that's served with cinnamon spiced (?) chickpeas, pickle, green chutney. The chickpeas were really good though hard to scoop up with the bhatura. Eat the bhatura while it's hot since it's quite greasy and isn't so nice when it's cooled down.Batata Puri ($6ish) - is more of an appetizer with 6 puri floating in a yogurt tamarind sauce and filled with something undetermined. I hate yogurt yet loved this dish.Masala Dosa ($9ish) - another dish that's a meal with a filled dosa, curry, coconut chutney, etc. It was good but not amazing like the other dishes. I probably could have skipped this and saved some stomach room to finish the other plates."
2037,"What is no to like about Vik's Chaat?  You order at the counter then go over toward the bathrooms and wash your hands, find a table and then wait for your name to be called.  yes, they are very busy but we have yet to find a place that consistently has Yummy Indian food in out search over N. California.  We discovered that as long as you are in the door before close they will take your order and serve you.   The down side is now that they are so popular the prices have gotten higher and the line longer."
2038,"I drive a lot from Stockton to Sf or the bay almost daily. One of the many upbeats is FOOD. I take advantage of the miles I'm out with Food. Vik's is off the beaten path and parking on the street not so much but that's ok, there's a lot. The building is open, bright & welcoming. I arrived a little before 12 and it was slightly busy. I didn't have to wait long. The order line is easy and staff was helpful. I ate the special of the day which was spicy eggplant and all the goodies that accompany the daily lunch specials. Today black eyed peas one of my favorites. Great food, excellent quality and I'll be back"
2039,"What's is the hype all about? Chaat is my favorite food, everrrr.. And this place screws it all up! The samosa was pathetic - extremely spicy, and way too much jeera..The Ras malai was crumbly!None of the food sold here is by any standards tasty. And the prices are way too high!"
