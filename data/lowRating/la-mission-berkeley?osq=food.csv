0,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
1,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
2,"Loooong, cold wait outside for this one. Had the fried plantains with black beans. Average taste and required some hot sauce for both items as the seasoning was pretty melow. Next we had the Mole chicken burrito. I guess having lived all over Texas I have been exposed to Amazing mole before. This stuff here doesn't stack up. It looked like they put maybe 2 teaspoons of sauce over the meat of the burrito. It definitely did not look like the dripping picture I saw on the ad!!!! Not worth the drive over from San Fran for this one."
3,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
4,Stingy on meat in burritos ... Over priced... And I found a huge hair in between my burrito ...meaning they don't wear hair nets or they are very unsanitary .... Something just isn't right here .. this was my second visit and I'm highly disgusted now...
5,Place did not live up to the hype. My girlfriend and I were expecting really good Mexican food (she's from LA I'm from San Diego) but instead we got an average burrito and below average rolled tacos. In addition to that the prices weren't that great. Even the horchata was small and expensive. Disappointed and won't be coming back.
6,1 word. Terrible.  I should have noticed when it wasn't crowded.  We were extremely disappointed with this place.  Had a good experience there a few months ago.  Spent 33.00 on a carnitas steak beans rice and potato burrito and a barbacoa lamb Plato for the missus. The burrito had a little burnt Pork and uncooked potatoes with a little beans. The barbacoa was watery. Ate part of the burrito and threw it away the plato as the lamb was inedible.  We had planned to go to the Mexican store and deli across from the post office on San Pablo. Never again. Just plain awful.
7,"Extremely disappointed. I will not come back and would not recommend it.  I Spent over $5 for one taco that was normal sized. There was nothing great about the meat,  plus the tortillas were burnt and hard."
8,"My burrito was terrible, hands down. And, I had to wait over 15 minutes to get it. I have no idea why this place has 4-5 star reviews. Don't fall for the ratings."
9,"This place sucks. The mole entree, beans, and Jamaica agua fresca were all bad, all bland and lacking authentic flavor. Not sure who thinks this place is good - maybe people who have never tried decent Mexican food. Try Gordo's instead."
10,The reason why my review rating has changed is because I tried other dishes and it was meh. I still believe the steak enchilada is the best dish I have had there but most of everything else falls short.
11,"I decided to try this mexican place in Berkeley based on all the great reviews and comments on Authenticity. Needless to say, I was disappointed with my overall experience here. I came here right before the lunch rush so I was able to avoid the long lines. The indoor seating is very tight and the seats are arranged in a row of table along the wall. It's difficult for those sitting facing the wall to be comfortable because that space is the same space shared by those waiting in line. The tables look solid, but the one at sat at was pretty wobbly. There is however, plenty of outdoor seating, relatively speaking. The bathrooms are outdoors around the corner, and you need a key to get in. I ordered a carnita burrito with mild salsa, black beans, and cheese (+25 cents) fajita style (35 cents for added veggies and onions). Needless to say, I was disappointed at the quality and portion of my burrito. The tortilla wasn't moist and fluid, but rather dry and chalky. The carnitas itself was actually okay, but a bit dry for me. The veggies were decent, and the tomatoes were pretty fresh. The burrito wasn't that large either, though for the price of $8.23 (with tax) it was just okay. I'd rather go down to los moles though. They also do not serve free chips/salsa like a lot of mexican eateries. Chips/salsa is ~$2.80 to get on its own. Los moles, tacqueria, dos, guads all serve free chips/salsa so this is another cripe for me.Overall, not the most pleasant lunch dining experience. Their other non-burrito items may be good and I hope much better than their burritos. No free chips/salsa . If you come with a large group, prepared to sit outside comfortably or indoors uncomfortably."
12,I visited this place this past Friday after my friend urged me to check it out.I had a steak quesadilla  a side of rice a chicken taco and some chips.The good: the employees are nice and the hours are decent. They closed at 11 that night.The bad : They left out my order of chips after I had already paid. I would have went back but there were creeps (other customers) who were trying to get my number. I guess this place is popular with the drunk crowd.The ugly : Food was meh. Rice was under seasoned / needed salt. The quesadilla was okay at best. I've had  a better quesadilla ( spicy Chicken Jack FTW) from Del Taco which should tell you something . Definitely something I would not crave or go out of my way to get again.Lastly that chicken taco was one of the worst I ever had. No flavor.  I thought this was supposed to be an authentic  mexican food place?? Salsa was bland as well. Barely any spiciness. Go here if you want slightly over priced bland mexican food.
13,"I had the steak burrito & The rice was overly cooked and under seasoned, the beans didn't have much of a flavor or much the right portion of beans, the over loaded it with beans and rice to safe money I must believe, the meat was tough and overly cooked and held for awhile, the juices weren't there so I applied salsa and the salsa didn't have any acidity but only spice, the tomato in the pico do gallo was underripe!"
14,"I probably just got one of the rare instances of poor service, but I still feel compelled to give a review for it.Today I waited 25 minutes for a single burrito and chips order, to go, and the quality was nothing to write home about. It could just be that my tastes are different, but waiting almost half an hour for subpar food when there are a couple other places nearby that does better/faster isn't all that appealing. And then,   the restaurant is pretty small, and being crammed inside when ordering and waiting for your food is pretty sucky. All in all, this place is pretty popular and people will probably like it more than others who won't. I just happen to be part of the latter."
15,"Converted old school Taco Bell building. My college age son had no sense of this. The building shows its age and could be more clean. The cashier Jose is polite and attentive and works his butt off.The bean/rice/cheese burrito I ordered took 20 minutes from ordering to table. The cheese was not melted and the cook packed it with rice but very little beans. The tortilla was not warm. Odd because the burrito was wrapped in foil.I am certain it was not pre-made. This was a flat out terrible burrito but I ate it out of starvation and no quick alternative. It was only edible because of the house hot sauce. On that subject, use the green sauce, avoid the red sauce unless you like sauce saturated with cumin.My son was neutral on his pork chimi plate. He had dined here before and actually suggested this place today. He stated his previous experience was more positive. We ate inside. Since the food took quite some time to arrive we were immersed in the ambiance, such as it is.I like Mexican music once in awhile and like it in the background when dining Mexican. The music playing at La Mission is just bad music. Some kind of sub regional form of Mexican music. It screams out of very poor speakers. Where is the perspective? Do the operators of this place think this is inviting? This was strike three for Mexican food in Berkeley. Sticking to Pizza and burgers from now on."
16,"I came here for my lunch break and ordered a chicken burrito. Long story short, I've had better burritos even though it's not an authentic Mexican thing. I'm Mexican, I know better, it's not worth it. Go to a taco truck instead."
17,"This place used to be soon good. But the last few times I've been I have waited, at an outside table in the cold, for 30 minutes only to find that they just forgot about my order. I've had carryout where I asked for extra salsa and didn't get any. The last tacos I had here were so overdone, dry, nearly burnt, that I should have sent them back but.. I had waited for 30 minutes. There was never an ""I'm so sorry about the mixup"" or anything. No refund, even partial, was offered at all. Just shade. Maybe I wouldn't care so much if they hadn't been so awesome just a few months ago. I doubt I'll go back."
18,"I went to this restaurant because I saw a lot of good reviews. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. I ordered the mole flautas. The mole was all watered down with a very artificial flavor to it. The chicken in the flautas tastes as if it was from a few days ago. And to make it worst, they add pickled jalapeños as a side, which it's like giving you a street taco with a side of soy sauce! This is not an authentic Mexican food restaurant, it is very generic, thus the prices of the food appeared to be as if it was authentic!!! Very Very disappointing!!!"
19,"La Mission is overhyped and expensive. The food is really bland, and the dining room is small. It basically caters to hipsters and people who have never had authentic Mexican or decent Tex-Mex food in their lives. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else instead. For starters, I recommend El Burro Picante a few blocks east on University. Second star only because I've been here twice and didn't get food poisoning either time."
20,"3 our of 5 stars. The stars are mostly for the staff's friendly demeanor.I received a referral from a friend to get their famous mole. Maybe I'm not a mole lover altogether since I did not particularly enjoy the mixing of sweet flavors with savory.After the mole plate, I was still hungry so I ordered their shrimp ceviche, chile verde pork burrito, and 2 flans. I thought the flavors were alright for Mexican food. (I'm spoiled by being raised around Santa Ana, CA.) Okay, consider me extremely spoiled since I thought it was absurd that they would charge for salsa. It's free down in SoCal! C'mon...They had good flan, which oddly tasted better refrigerated and eaten a few days after."
21,"I'm just really not impressed. I wanted to like this place so much, but it was subpar for me. Sort of bland, and disappointing when my food came with some cheese crumbles even though I asked for no cheese. I would recommend Picante or Sol y Luna (especially for the vegans/vegetarians)."
22,"To be charged $12.50 for Nachos with chicken and guacamole, without beans, sour cream or jalapenos is ridiculous.  To wait a half an hour for it was bad.  But the worse part is to get back to work and there is no chicken on the nachos."
23,First time here (today). I am Mexican American (born and raised in the Bay Area) and I am very picky!!! I love crispy tacos and mole. Not impressed. Those who are giving 3+ stars are just plain settling or don't know anything about great Mexican food. Granted the place was clean and friendly but the quality was sub par. I had the crispy chicken taco and a side mole w chicken. Can I just say they are so cheap that they filled the (not so crispy) taco with beans before adding the lettuce and small pieces of chicken. The mole had 3 small pieces of chicken - it was more like a soup not chili with meat. No flavor in the tacos...needs salt and or garlic. The chicken is dry. Tacos should include the following: meat+cheese+salsa and or pico de gallo - not stuffed with fillers like beans & Mole should have plenty of meat... not just be chili alone. Disappointed and not at all impressed with the portions.I will stick to the Los Moles in Emeryville (yummy) or head to Cactus for my crispy tacos (2 for $5.50).
24,"Definitely better than the Taco Bell it replaced. The woman ahead of us in line raved about the mole. I always buy mole paste from Guelgazeta in LA then make my own at home. This was the saddest mole I've experienced anywhere. One reviewer said that the chocolate flavor overwhelmed everything else, bu mine didn't get that far. The shredded chicken was swimming in watery juice with some more solid mole on top, hard to taste the mole at all. Very unremarkable rice and beans. My friend got a carnitas burrito, it was quite serviceable. When in Berkeley, better to head to Oakland and the taco trucks."
25,"The food is shiteous. I'm a Mexican dude and this food is fine for trendy douchebags, but is crap for Mexicans."
26,"I think my expectations might have been set too high based on the very high rating of this place.I went by one night; from other reviewers I had the impression that the carnitas here were out of this world so I figured I'd give them a day in court.  I ordered the carnitas burrito and sat outside on a warm summer day.  Overall a pleasant setting right next to busy University Ave.The carnitas was entirely respectable.  But it was not outstanding.  It was not the best in the Bay Area, nor probably even the best in Berkeley.  It was a bit dry and there wasn't a whole lot of it.  It didn't come with chips either, which is a minor nuisance but a bit annoying when they don't throw in at least a few of those automatically when you order a burrito.Don't get me wrong, it was a perfectly good carnitas burrito but it wasn't anything particularly special nor was it anything I would travel too far to get.  Taquieras are plentiful and I haven't yet been blown away by this place's offerings.  I'll try again later and maybe update this review.UPDATEFool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.Actually I don't feel that I need to be shamed for giving this place a second chance but I won't open myself up to the possibility of feeling ashamed for going back a third time.I went to try the legumbres burrito last time around.  I placed the order and was asked if I wanted cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.  I said sure why not.  Turns out you pay for the cheese and sour cream ala carte. I can see the guacomole costing extra but the ""cheese"" and sour cream?  The extra bit of money is a non-issue but it still chaps me a bit that not only do they ding you for cheese and sour cream but chips are still not automatically part of the bargain.  All this could have been forgiven had the burrito been as good as the reviews would imply.  Alas, it was still flavorless.  I am fairly certain there was no actual cheese, just some sort of processed cheese like substance (hence the quotation  marks above).  I was also hard pressed to identify anything that had ever been an avocado. It's not quite as convenient but you'll find more authenticity and better food at Casa Latina Bakery around the corner on San Pablo.I won't waste another visit here."
27,"Used to love this place. But the last three times I went the service was super slow and they messed up my order. The quality of their once excellent salsas has gone down. I found a bug floating in my water.  Their lettuce on their tostadas and burritos is cut in overly large sizes unchewable to any normal human. And if you're a particular vegetarian, beware. They cook their tortillas on a nasty greasy meat smothered grill. You're better off eating at Chipotle.  By the way their horchata sucks. If u end up eating this filth, be sure to hold onto your receipt, so you can have them correct your order after they screw it up. Or just get your money back."
28,"Update:  Was in here last month and I vowed I would not come back after the guy at the counter charged me for chips.  I cannot remember the last time I was charged for chips at a Mexican Restaurant.  Seems to me that if I am buying Mexican food at your establishment the chips should be part of the meal.  When I go eat at Chinese restaurants I am never charged for my fortune cookie and orange that comes at the end of my meal, should be the same thing here.Just as I was leaving this restaurant, I wanted to confirm that the chips cost $$ so I asked the lady working there, and she confirmed saying that the chips are handmade so they have to charge.    Sadly, this is what I remember last from my visit here so ONE star for this spot that I used to think differently for.  Too many other spots that don't nickel and dime their customers."
29,"I don't really see what the hype is about this place. Is it because they used organic free range beef or something? The wait here is ridiculous for a place that serves tacos and burritos and the prices are kind of high. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes good but it's not anything close to being anything special, or even one of the best places in Berkeley. If you're out all the way here you might as well go to Casa Latina which has way nicer and plentiful seating as well as much faster service."
30,"Went here to get a quick fish taco and man was I way off base.  The ticket time on my fish taco was 26 minutes...really!?A tortilla, a fish stick, and salsa assembled in 26 minutes?!  It wasnt worth the wait at all, wont be back.Fish taco is $4.50, rediculous"
31,Food was OK. Atmosphere sucked. Shrimp burrito had about 3 small shrimp entire burrito. Overpriced for what was offered.
32,"Probably very authentic, but not my cup of tea. Surprisingly few vegetarian options. First time, my chile relleno was still cold in the middle. Second time, the filling of my enchilada was 90% celery. And the seating is very uncomfortable."
33,I just don't get it!!!!How on earth does a small restaurant with great reviews some how miss on delivery of a meal? I ordered the Barbacoa Lamb burrito with EXTRA HOT SAUCE to go.What I got was dry lamb with NO HOT SAUCE at all!!!When an individual order HOT SAUCE in a meal that pretty much tells you he likes flavor in his food. Dry Lamb over dry rice with black beans = someone hand me a bottle of hot sauce!!!! I really do not like leaving poor review but sometimes you have to let people know.I read plenty of reviews and drove from Oakland just to get a bite to eat. :(Not sure why this is their most expensive burrito. Bathroom was very clean.one 5-star!!!NEXT
34,"went there fr black beans, they were on the salty  and had cheese on them,  I stated to the cashier I was allergic to dairy she made a little face buth changed them, then I asked fr mexican salsa and she said it was $0.90 extra! I asked why do you charge for it when it is free at all the taquerias?, she said Tomatoes, onions, cilantro are EXPENSIVE!!! anyways ........won't go there again....a thousand better mex taquerias  in Concord...."
35,"Hmm. Maybe the hype killed it for me and I expected better. Maybe I just didnt order the right things. Who knows.I came here because of the great reviews on yelp and on their recommendations, ordered the pork mole. There was just TOO MUCH sauce. And the sauce was pretty sweet, almost like a bbq sauce so half way through the burrito I was already craving some other flavors. The salsas/sauces they provide arent spicy either so it didnt change much of that sweet flavor. I do want to note that the burritos are quite large though. My friend got the ceviche which was good. My boyfriend says I should just get the regular burritos so I'm willing to come back to try it again."
36,"The only reason we went here was because Juan's opens at 1:00 pm on Sunday and my other son said this was pretty good. He must have been really hungry because he was wrong. This is the former Taco Bell on University. The one my boyfriend and I went to in the 70's when we were stoned and ordered one of everything on the menu. First of all, I didn't really like their menu because the descriptions were vague. I wanted a vegetable burrito but I wanted something more than the regular so I made the mistake of ordering the ""seasoned?"" vegetable burrito. I expected something like you get in the Mission in SF, where I have had really good vegetable burritos with roasted vegetables. What I got was a run of the mill vegetable burrito with CELERY and CARROTS in it. First time in all my years someone has put celery in a burrito I have eaten. Hopefully, that will be the last. It was carrots and celery and beans and rice and guacamole and sour cream. The carrots were not cooked through either. The fish tacos my son's friend had were good. The prices were too high for the ""quality"" of food we got, people who came later were served before people who had been waiting. Seating was awful. Inside, the sun poured in and was blinding. (An investment in a sun-blocking shade is not that much). Outside, it was windy. The only semi-sheltered table was on a slope. One side of the table slowed downhill and made for very uncomfortable seating. Not a fan and will not go back."
37,Only 4 orders ahead of us in line and it took over 25 minutes for our lunch to arrive. Luckily they brought our chips and salsa after 10 minutes. The food was ok but this place is nothing to go out of your way to eat at.
38,"The only reason I'm writing this review is because this place is not close to be deserving this rating...think of it as a reality check.  There is nothing spectacular at all, and it's non-distinguishable from any other average taco joint in town.  I've been here enough times, tried enough dishes, to say nice attempt, but the flavors just aren't coming together.  Horchata was good, but where have you had one that was bad?...seriously, put enough sugar in anything and it's good.  Sure it's cheap, sure there's parking.  But it's just plain and average."
39,"I don't understand why this place has so many great reviews. I had a bad experience the first time I went there when ordering a Mole burrito, their ""special"". The burrito comprise of little more than rice and beans and there was NO mole in it anywhere.I gave them the benefit of the doubt, given the reviews of high praise. This time I ordered something standard, a carne asada burrito. Yet again, the burrito was just average. The meat was a bit gamey and the entire burrito had a bland flavor, something I could have easily made myself at home.I have definitely had better mexican food before and given its comparable quality, this place is overpriced and overrated.Do yourself a favor, try somewhere else"
40,"Today was my third visit after three month breaks in between each visit. I really wanted to like this establishment and give them another shot, even though they made my order wrong the first two times. If you watch the food preparers, you will notice they just make the food according to the normal menu (adding sour cream and guacamole) when my order specifically did not include those items. Now today was off the charts. I witnessed the food preparer leave her station to go add steak to the grill. She was not using a utensil or plastic gloves. I then watched her walk to the hand washing sink and rinse her hands with water without drying them and then proceed to start making a few burritos. She did not use soap, and she did not dry her hands. This is a serious health violation. I immediately called to the expeditor who was rinsing salsa bottles in the same sink. I explained what I witnessed and she apologized. I informed her that I did not want that particular food server handling my food until she washed her hands with soap properly. She granted my request, but let the food preparer continue to make food without having her return to the sink to wash her hands properly. I called her back and said, ""why don't you have her wash her hands properly."" The expeditor continued to appease me by saying, ""I understand and I am sorry."" I replied, ""I accept your apology but you need to send her to wash her hands."" She kept repeating herself while I just kept reiterating the importance of her contaminating the food she was preparing. Needless to say, they didn't get the message and I am reporting them to the Department of Environmental Health. I will also never eat there again after this third bad experience. I will also never recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. And lastly, the Owner can call me and explain why they don't care about your health! Tim 510-379-8353."
41,Ordered a burrito to go with salsa and + $1.80 for guacamole.Took burrito home and started eating.No salsa.No guacamole.Sadness ensued :(The burrito was just OK. You can get equal quality for less money elsewhere. Salsa and guac probably would have helped.
42,"My boyfriend and I gave this place two chances.  The first time we both had the mole special burrito.  We both agreed it was just okay, but saw things that looked good and wanted to come back.We came back and I had the shrimp fajitas and he had the taquitos.  The shrimp fajitas were SO OVERCOOKED.  I could barely bite into my shrimp it was so rubbery.  The taquitos were just okay.  Also, for some reason, lots of people who came in after us were served before us (probably because they cooking my shrimp to death).  Will not go back for a third try."
43,"Places I have had better burritos:Food Trucks, the freezer section at 7-11, even Taco Bell.I could care less about your moles...moles shmoles, if you can't do a burrito, you're not worth your frijoles.Went in based on the great reviews and I felt thoroughly cheated.  Waited way too long and paid way too much.  The burritos I got were sloppy, and lacking in any flavor except SALT.  Got some ""guacamole"" that was mostly sour cream.  I sadly lamented that they did not even include a handful of chips with my order as I set about playing ""find the meat"" in my burrito.  It astounds me that so many people can be so easily duped. To any and all of you who enjoy La Mission, BART across the bay and grab a real burrito/taco/etc. in The Mission District.Nooooo Bueno!"
44,"Decent flavor. Got an al pastor burrito. It was al pastor flavored...I found 3 yes three, small pieces of meat in my entire burrito. Paid extra for cheese but I couldn't find any of that either. Won't be coming back."
45,Costs money to eat here! And the food tastes like burrito. Their horchata reminds me of rice water and their chips are just salty tortillas.
46,"This place has it all! Read through the reviews: 30 minute-waits for food (i.e. time for reflection), food poisoning to strengthen that immune system, traditional middle-ages sanitation practices , surprising you with someone else's order! What else could you ask for?Here's my experience from today:Most people were waiting 25-30 minutes for their food. 30 minutes to make a burrito. Let that sink in.After my food finally arrived, I bit into my burrito and discovered that they had given me a carne asada burrito. Being a vegetarian, I didn't make a big deal about this even though I was grossed out. I asked for my money back, because I explained that I didn't have another 30 minutes to wait for another burrito. The guy at the counter offered to make me another burrito right then, but then inexplicably rescinded his offer. He gives me my money back. I ask him what else he can do for me, explaining that I had just wasted 30 minutes since I no longer have a burrito. He says that he can't give me another burrito without charging me. I explain that he messed up my order and that he should give me another burrito. He replies that they had to throw out 2 burritos already (the one I bit into, and the one that the other guy, who had my burrito, bit into), and that he can't give me another burrito because of this. I tell him that this is his problem and not mine. He says that there's nothing else that he can do for me except give me my money back.What a classy establishment!"
47,This place sucks. Used to be good. Horrible slow service. Not clean enough from a herbivore's perspective. They mess up orders every time.  The salsas are weak. The chips are too oily.  Go elsewhere for a better meal.
48,"Not impressed.  My gf and I went here because of the strong reviews, but after 3 different kinds of dry and bland tacos, I'm left wondering how they have such a cult following...?"
49,"I love Mexican food... I eat lots of it... After eating at La Mission, I was wishing it was still a Taco Bell.  I ordered the Taco Grande with carne asada, and Guacamole and Chips.  The handsome guy that took my order, brought me my guac and chips first....  The guacamole is whitish green in color.. a sure sign that it has extenders like mayo, or sour cream.... It was tasteless ...No fresh avocado and lemon taste you expect... and the salsa had been refrigerated too long, and the tomatoes and onions were translucent.  The chips tasted stale, and the salsas were not very good either.... No spice.  No taste.  When the handsome guy brought my taco... I asked if they make the guacamole here, and he said, 'Yes!... Do you like it?'.... I said, 'No.. it is very white, and tasteless..'... he said, 'Let me check on it'.... and I never heard back from him, even though there were no new customers after me.  Taco Grande, is a Taco Poco in the Mission in SF..... Two little corn tortillas with over done meat, beans, and the translucent salsa...no lettuce, no cheese...not sure what makes it so 'Grande'?....  Anyway... skip place.  The recipes are horrible.  The worst guacamole I've ever been served anywhere.."
50,"We came to this place because of all the good reviews and it was honestly the grossest experience ever. We ordered the mole burrito and the flautas with guacamole added. The mole burrito was just ok, way too much onions. The flautas were DISGUSTING!! When he took a bite of the flauta he instantly spit it out. The chicken inside was hard and frozen. I didn't believe it so I touched the chicken and it was ice cold. The nice guy at the counter had them bring us out some more and they forgot the guacamole. The first 2 flautas were bland and still a little cold but the third one was again frozen. I also don't like wasting food so I was going to take the other half of my burrito home so I asked for foil and 10 minutes later, nothing. Never coming back. EVER."
51,"This place sucks. Overpriced, half an hour to get my food, and tasted bland. Go somewhere else."
52,"This review is from someone who is from souther california and so is always around Mexican food. We got a horchata, lamb taco, carnitas taco, baja fish taco w/ rice and beans, and the ceviche because I was craving ceviche and if you can find a decent place it's easier for that quick fix than making it yourself.Best part of the meal was the horchat. The baja fish taco was second place in that it was really crispy and a decent size. Lamb Taco and Carnitas was ok. Lots of meat in the taco but the flavor just wasn't there and so not worth the price. Rice was undercooked and beans looked dry with a penny size portion of cheese on top of it. Ceviche came out in a tiny ramekin looking all minced up and with 4 tiny slices of avocado on top. Flakes of overcooked fish was there but couldnt' find any large pieces of shrimp. All in all definitely NOT worth it. The other people in my group got a burrito that was super bland and the chiliquiles (which was decent). Reason for 2 stars? we asked for extra fresh salsa because the amount they put on was just ridiculous. They charge for salsa. They'll give you free pureed in a squeeze bottle salsa but the fresh stuff they charge. They also charge for any little thing you want to add such as sour cream, etc when other places don't. If it was cheaper then maybe it would've been ok but the way it is, not worth it. Wahoos has better flavor than this and they're not even authentic mexican. Overpriced get your mexican food cravings filled elsewhere."
53,"I've never been so upset with a meal that I left after only 5 bites to go to another restaurant.Cons:-I asked for ""only a little"" rice and about 70% of the filling was rice. I scooped most of it out, but what was left was still terrible.-cheese, sour cream, and guacamole are not included so you have to pay extra for each one. My first few bites were dry, so I cut the burrito open to see if they had just forgotten to put each in. They were there...barely. The portions for each were unbelievably small; I could barely see each one.-the salsa (included in the burrito) was also almost nonexistent. -the burrito was not warm. In fact, the tortilla was a little cold.-the meat, beans, and tortilla were incredibly dry and flavorless-when I asked for extra salsa, I was given a bottle similar to a plastic ketchup bottle. I tried it and it was disgusting. Obviously their salsa is not fresh and they store it for who knows how long.-no beer available.-limited seating, bad decorPros:-parking lot in the back-fast serviceIn sum, it was literally the worst burrito I've ever had and I could not stand to finish it, so I left after eating a few bites (and tearing the burrito up to get rid of all of the excess rice and to look for the elusive sour cream, cheese, guac, and salsa). I went to a nearby Mexican restaurant and got my fix."
54,Came here once based on the good review of Yelp. Big disappointment. The food was very mediocre. Won't go back.
55,"I read from other yelp reviews that this place used to be an old taco bell.  It's not a place I would to have a conversation, but I do appreciate eating burritos with a ghetto ambiance.  food: it's not the best burrito in the bay.  I wouldn't be able to recommend anything better because I haven't lived here very long, but I'm sure something better is out there.  It's really just meat, beans, and rice.  Nothing exceptional about the meat and the salsa has a far too subtle taste to be appreciated.  The burrito itself is much larger in girth than at places like la burrita, but it's wrapped very poorly and, in comparison to socal burritos, is of standard size.  didn't wow me, sorry."
56,"Ok, if you are a vegetarian, DO NOT GO HERE! They have a chicken tortilla soup and a vegetable tortilla soup. I asked over and over again if the broth was vegetarian, they said yes, which is why they have a separate soup. I ate half the bowl, then came upon huge chunks of chicken at the bottom of the soup. I have been veg for about 6 years and was disgusted!! I think, they use the same broth. They were all shocked and apologized, but still, they are not careful."
57,"I really really loved La Mission. That is, until last Saturday. I went to La Mission with two friends to get some burritos for dinner - I had the vegetarian burrito (no cheese, no sour cream), she had the prawn burrito, and he had the steak burrito. As usual, the food was delicious and we ate every bite. Sunday night, I started puking my guts out. Monday morning, he started puking his guts out. Turns out, she started puking her guts out on Monday morning as well. This is the only ingestion that we've had in common in recent days, and the timing was just right for some good old food poisoning. Needless to say, one of the tastiest burritos in the East Bay is now off my menu for good. Whether it was poor health and sanitation practices or some sort of bad ingredient, I wouldn't wish that on anybody."
58,"Had the cheese quesadilla and carnitas tacos. Highly disappointed. I don't care much about the quesadilla (and reinforces my dislike for them) but the tacos...overpriced at $2.25 per taco. Utterly dry meat. And the green sauce thing, I forget what it's called, did not excite my taste buds one bit. And the way they prepped it, well, it could have been better...way too wet for my likings."
59,"I do not understand how so many people give good reviews about this place.   I tried it, and believe me, its not all its cracked up to be.  The employees are not sanitary; they handle cash and then have direct contact with the food/plates/utensils.  The food is bland and trust me, I would make a run for the border (Taco Bell)."
60,"Have to say that I have had great food every time I have been there but I always had taken it to go.   So I looked a little foolish when I bought my girlfriend with me today for fish tacos on her first visit.   Well wouldn't you know it we had terrible luck.  Everything was different; the people, the food, etc.  So, I just wanted to qualify my earlier review.  I know everyone has a bad day; this just means that the folks at La Mission did too."
61,Super expensive maxican food with absolutely no flavor.   Avoid this place by all means.
62,"I don't even want to give it two stars. Taco's and burritos are bland as hell and the meat's dry, the food in general tastes off and authentic my @$$."
63,"OK - everyone here on yelp needs to take a breath and review this place more reasonably.  First: I want to address the shady reviews below.  A place opens up a few weeks ago and are instantly granted glowing reviews by people that have no friends and no other reviews?  I'm skeptical that these are genuine (the first 5 seem blatantly fraudulent).Secondly:  They are over-priced.  The basic burrito (while very tasty!) will cost you about $9.  Then they stab you with cheese (for extra) and guac (for extra) and sour creme (for extra).  Oh wait they don't TELL you it costs extra, but when you're purchasing it at the counter they ask ""do you want a burrito with everything?"" you of course say yes.  My burrito and coke cost me $14.  I sat down at the table perplexed: WTF did I just spend 14 dollars on!? (the ""mexican"" coke bottle was almost $3).  I almost walked out when I saw that a single taco was about $4.50.  On what planet does a taco cost more than $2.50?I ate with a friend and we shared a plate of chips and salsa.  I did like this - with their two salsas and fresh pico de gallo.  If they added a bit less salt to their chips, this would be the best thing ever.  I also wish there was more room to sit inside.  The tables are tiny and 3 plates (2 burritos and chips) do not really fit well and I knocked my silverware on the floor a few times.  It was a cold night in Berkeley and everyone eating there had to squeeze in next to each-other and practically share their tables.  I do look forward to when they get a liquor license (provided their drinks aren't as exorbitantly priced as their food) and when the patio opens.  In the end I will go back.  Their burritos are gigantic and the pastor that I had in it was really tasty.  But now that I know, don't add cheese and sour creme and guac!  The price left a sour taste in my mouth and I will re-review once I have a chance to purchase things more wisely."
64,"I am giving it one star because i had a particularly bad experience. I ordered a carnitas burrito and the meat was dry and there were also parts that were burnt to a crisp. It surprised me for a burrito to be this bad. Coming from southern california, I was hoping that i could finally satisfy my craving for a burrito, but that did not happen. I also ordered an horchata and it was particularly grainy and seemed to come from the ""bottom of the barrel"".  This meal definitely ruined my expectations and my lunch, especially after reading so many good reviews."
65,"I ordered a vegetarian burrito, listed as $5.50. My boyfriend grabs the carne asada $7.50. He asks us if we want guac, sour cream, and salsa in the burritos, we nod yes. He tells me my total, $19.40..... uh what? Turns out guac is an extra $1.80 PER BURRITO, and the other things he mentioned are all also extra.. Seriously? I came here based on the reviews, and especially that this place was good for the ""college budget"". I can go to El Charro in Lafayette and get an entire dinner for two with sides of rice and beans for $25. So I was expecting this $10 burrito to be phenomenal, and sure it was good. But NOT worth $10. And they skimp on the carne asada. Would not go back, i walked away feeling totally ripped off."
66,"What the hell Bay Area?? Quit overeating everything! Paid $8 for a chicken burrito with cheese and sour cream extra FIRST MISTAKE, started eating the second I sat in my car and it was already lukewarm SECOND MISTAKE, got a nasty bit of cartilage in the last few bites THIRD MISTAKE YOU'RE OUT!! Go to Gordos or something .."
67,Had high hopes for this place! When we walked in were excited to fresh everything! So we placed an order Togo 2 fish tacos enchaladas and pazole. When we got home the fish tacos weren't fried long enough so the batter was mush. One bite couldn't bring myself to eat the rest. It was soposto come with rice and beans but never got it even though I was charged for it. My husbands enchaladas were tolerable his rice and beans made me happy I didn't get mine! The pazole was ok. I have had much better! Can't believe I flushed 40$ down the toilet on this place I want my money back!!!!
68,"Went there for a light dinner and wasn't particularly impressed.  The food was OK, but nothing special.  The grilled fish taco was tasty, but I've had better fish tacos elsewhere.  The portions were large, and I did appreciate the home made tortillas chips.  I doubt I will go back, with all the other options in Berkeley."
69,"After reading what others say in this site, we were excited to try this place.  It is our first time being there.  The first young woman who was at the cashier's, ready to take our order. She was very helpful explaining to us their dishes.  She told us that we can try two different enchiladas on the plate order.  Unfortunately, the second woman took over and refused let us order two different kinds of enchiladas.  We decided to try the mole since people loved it so much.  The dish was okay, nothing special.  They were however stingy on the rice portion.  We also ordered the chili verde burrito.  The pork was grilled and dry (couldn't taste any chili verde).  It definitely could use more chili verde sauce. It would be good if it had come with some salsa."
70,I can't say that there's anything that I've had here that I would order again.  The location is convenient however and they're open late so I will most likely be back.  Their outdoor patio is nice but the inside is definitely cramped.  The dessert selection looks delicious.
71,I'm from Southern California so I've been to hundreds of restaurants far better than La Mission.I think that the food I had was mediocre and overpriced.I will not be returning.
72,"I feel bad about this mediocre review for a pretty good restaurant that would otherwise get 3 or 4 stars. A super carne asada burrito costs just about $10, pre tax (and it didn't come with chips). That is just too much. I can't think of any top notch taco joints in the Mission that charge that much. It was a good burrito - which is hard to find in Berkeley - but doesn't approach the quality of the best places in the city. I didn't really pay attention to the prices on any of the other stuff on the menu. However, if they adjust their prices to make the super burritos cost what they are worth $7-$8, I would definitely up the rating."
73,"No, not worth 4 and a half stars, not even close.  Could have been a contender though, if it weren't for the salt being at the upper limit of tolerable (why are so many cooks so stupid about this?  You can add it anytime but once you dump too much in and screw it up, the game is over), and the noise being just plain intolerable.I went in there for an early lunch, and some radio station was on at a good 85 decibels, while the two staff members in the kitchen were yelling and screaming to each other to be heard over the din.I ordered a single chile relleno with rice and beans.  Came with 4 corn tortillas but no chips and salsa.  Also came with a bill over 10 bucks.  Got to enjoy it all in a spare, cramped ""ambience"" that consisted of nothing but hard surfaces everywhere.Nope, not a deal"
74,"Very disappointed. Tortillas were not freshly made, tasted like store bought tortillas. Guacamole tasted like the frozen ones sold at Restaurant depot.Portion size was really small. Desserts- tres leches cake and flan were OK, but Tiramisu cake tasted disgusting. Worst Mexican food. Will never go back."
75,"The veggie burrito was 90% rice and beans.  Also they charged me 45 cents because my purchase was under $8.  It is my understanding (as of 2010) that setting a minimum purchase requirement is ok,  but ""Surcharges are prohibited in the state of California. Existing law provides that no retailer may impose a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by other means."""
76,"Ate there today, and never will again. My grandmother is from Quintana Roo, so maybe I'm spoiled. I found the food flavorless. I had the chile colorado (pork) burrito with pinto. I like to taste my food and did not want to cover it up so I did not opt for sour cream, cheese or guacamole. It was not good. The rice and beans had no flavor and it seems as though they hunted down the driest bits of pork and added it to my burrito. I chewed and chewed and could not break it down.My daughter ordered the chicken burrito and ate only half. The other daughter had the nachos, she was happy with her order. I was not impressed, it was meh. The horchata was sweet beyond belief and really tasted like sweetened store bought rice milk. The service was lacking. Even after the disaster that was my meal,  I ordered a burrito to go for my husband (who was at home) because he wanted to try it. Inexplicably I had to wait for almost a half hour for it. The place was not that crowded. There were two people inside and three tables were taken up on the patio. There was no apology for the wait when the woman handed me that sorry excuse for a burrito. I'm sorry but I suspect people giving this place more than two stars have never had good Mexican food or they are hard up for a good place to try in Berkeley. Lord, head over to Picante if you want good Mexican cuisine; it's just a little more money, but well worth it. Do not waste your money here. P.S. I paid $42, for three burritos, a large Nacho and two horchatas."
77,"I went here because of the good reviews. We arrived it was very crowded/hard to find a seat.  I ordered the carnitas burrito with pinto beans, because of the good reviews on yelp.  My husband ordered the mole burrito, because he wanted to try it.  He got the sweet one over the spicy, because that is what the girl at the register thought he should get.  They brought them out and they were big.  I take a bite and think ""what is this"".  Husband is plowing through his.  I open mine up and start to get up and tell them they gave me the wrong burrito, never thinking this thing could be my husband's, when he said I think that is mine.  We trade and mine is one third gone.  He is disgusted I unwrapped his, but they served them to us wrong.  Anyway, I start eating mine and I thought it was fair.  The guacamole that everyone raved about was like something from a carton - like fake guac dip.  Then, it was full of rice and hardly anything else.   The mole burrito hubs did not like at all.  He did not like the sweet sauce.  He tried to pick out the meat, but he said it tasted like bar b q almost.  Anyway, I tried to give mine back to him and he did not want it.  We left not full and are not going to return.  I do not understand the good ratings.  Then, I got sick in the night about 3:00 AM. I will also say I do not  understand the ravings on the carnitas.  I opened my burrito and there was nothing carnitas about it - it looked like shredded pork roast I make for my own mexican food at home.  It did not look like carnitas at all."
