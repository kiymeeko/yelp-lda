0,Line is slow for no apparent reason. Parking is terrible. Service not great. I only come here when I'm braced for the aforementioned tediousness.
1,Drove all the way from Hayward to find out they were closed at 3. Would be nice to state that on the yelp page. Wasted our day.
2,"It says it's 24hrs but they are close , update your hours people I drove here for nothing"
3,Their gluten free pizza is not gluten free. They use the same tools to prepare the pizza as they do for gluten ones.
4,"The quality of the cheeses and olives are 5/5, however this review pertains to my recent customer experience with a certain Lydia. One of the sales reps deserves a 1/5. There are some ingredients that can be omitted from cheese...just as Lydia (sp) the salesperson's unnecessary at The Cheese Board. The collective can find better talent. Since having our first child this month, my wife's been home-bound. I thought to bring back several soft cheese samples (2 oz) and her favorite Hornbacher (thanks to another Cheese monger whose husband's a Cal professor). Through the acquisition of several different hard cheeses and multiple visits to The Cheese Board, I was able to help my wife determine her favorite hard cheese, Hornbacher. I usually purchase 1/2 lb to 1 lb. My experience at The Cheese Board has been overall positive. However, on 3/22, I sought to acquire a few soft cheeses to help her determine her favorite soft cheese. I spent about $41 for five pieces of cheese and olives. After my purchase, I darted off to the adjacent pizza establishment, Cheese Board Pizza. Unfortunately, it was past 3pm and they ceased pizza sales at 3pm, but the CBP informed me I could purchase the unheated pizza at the Cheese Board. I returned, only to overhear Lydia (sp) complain to her coworker in-front of a customer. She had not expected my immediate return. Confronting her, I told her that if it was so difficult to cut 1-2oz pieces, she should have been direct with me and told me how difficult it was to cut 1-2oz pieces or defer to a more experienced colleague of hers. Caught with her gossiping, she tried to smile. It was the only smile she made since serving customers was an obvious chore. The salespeople will generally give you a sample fractions of an ounce prior to your purchase so I cannot fathom the difficulty of cutting 1-2oz pieces, her excuse. If Lydia's complaint stemmed from consideration for other customers, bear in mind that she had the luxury of time to complain to her colleague and 3:40pm was certainly not a busy time of day. Does Lydia understand that one of the reasons why customers patronize a brick and mortar store instead of a gourmet online store is due to the customer experience? Customer service/sales/cheese monger is clearly unsuited for Lydia. On a separate note, I also noticed that Lydia did not cover one of the cheeses on the shelf which a stray fly obviously enjoyed. Fortunately, she did not offer me that wheel."
5,Everything taste great - the reason for only 1 Star? Stop touching money and touching the cheese without washing your hands!
6,This was the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. The staff is not friendly in person and if you get them on the phone you can almost see them roll their eyes at you for asking for help.  I believe in collective efforts and support local businesses. but I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. Their scones were 'ok' and the cheese is alright but the pain of dealing with this place made it not worth the stop.
7,"Geez, maybe caught em on wrong day. Greasy pesto 4 cheese w hard crust. The flavors aren't there. 2 stars for amazing jazz band on Sat afternoon"
8,"I can't believe it has come to this, Cheese Board. I rarely write Yelp reviews and like most people, it is unfortunately more often than not when something is especially bad. I live in the area and my mother, who is a cheese fanatic, was visiting from Maryland so I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to finally check this place out. After reading numerous reviews about how friendly and knowledgeable the staff was I thought it would be a perfect place to bring her. We came mid-afternoon and were lucky to find it uncrowded and have our card called right away. My mother, who also read the reviews, introduced herself to the girl helping us and explained a few cheeses she liked in the goat's milk category and said that she would like to try some new things similar to this. The girl could not have cared less. Not only did she not smile, she made every effort to make no eye contact whatsoever and to rush getting two cheeses out looking incredibly put out the entire time. She mumbled what they were and sighed with irritation when my mother leaned in to try and hear her.When she asked her about a raw goat's milk log written on the sign, she was very short and snapped ""Raw just means unpasteurized."" When my mother explained she knew that and was just curious about the specific cheese, the girl just repeated her answer. She made no effort to offer us other cheeses and just said ""So, do either of these work?"" My mother, still trying to be polite, asked how much a small piece of the second one would be. Again, another snappy nasty answer, ""Well, that depends on how small."" )@*$)(@*U%)(@ Really? I rarely want to slap someone but this girl drove me to it. You could say ""Well, a 1/4 pound is ____, is that close to what you're looking for?"" or something that provides, I don't know, some information about the product you're selling. It was like she was dying for us to get out of there and could care less about the cheese. Maybe she was having a bad day but it has been a LONG time since someone has been so disinterested and condescending to me for absolutely no reason especially when we were going out of our way to be nice because we were excited to be there.We put the corn cherry scone we'd taken out of the case back and walked out immediately. I will not be back."
9,I used to *love* this store until I watched workers handle cheese and money back and forth with no precautions to prevent the money contaminating the cheese. This wasn't a case of someone making a mistake once. After watching it happen on several visits to this store I stopped going there.
10,"Right when you walk into the store, you can't help but exclaim, ""Holy cow! Look at all these differents types of cheeses!"" I believe there were hundreds of different cheeses and I was impressed at first glance. Beware of the foul smell though.. there are some really stinky cheeses in there!Ok, so I'll admit that I am not a connoisseur of the different types of cheeses but you gotta start somewhere right? I was hoping to partake in a cheese tasting or be introduced to some of the bestselling cheeses in the store, but I was quite disappointed with my experience here. The lady who helped us try some of the cheeses was not that very helpful and seemed a bit frustrated because we didn't know what we wanted. Thanks for making me feel stupid lady. I felt very rushed and I didn't find the type of cheese that I was looking for. But we did find a sharp Gouda we liked, so we bought some of that. I tried the Amaretto, which was a fruity, hard type of cheese imported from Spain. The description sounded nice, but it did not taste good at all.I also tried a popular type of Brie here, which tasted pretty good with their freshly baked sourdough bread. However, I was grossed out when she grabbed a huge gunk of brie with her fingers and handed it over to me. It doesn't hurt to slice the brie with a knife.. ..whatever, I don't think I'd go out of my way to come here again. I would come again to try their pizzas next door though."
11,"It pretty much goes without saying that the cheeseboard pizza is superb, that their baked goods are perfect, and their cheese selection and prices are without peer. However, the layout of the cheese & pastry store in tandem with the typical Berkeley holier-than-thou clientele make this otherwise lovely collective a hellhole. At least for me. I will forget about cheese now and go to Arizmendi when I'm craving a pecan roll or the best baguette in the eastbay..."
12,"I agree with Mark B.When I was a broke punk ass kid I'd go here for free pizza after they closed, but I'd never actually pay for it.Besides, I'm an Indian and should avoid pizza anyway.Just because Petite basque and Gorgonzola are good on the cheeseplate, does not mean its good on pizza."
13,"They only serve one type of pizza a day and you have to stand on a line that extends out into the street to get it. The area, in  general, is overcrowded with no parking. In fact there are poor souls who actually sit and eat out in the grass median in the middle of the traffic.  People it's not worth it. The pizza quality is easily surpassed by most places in New York City.  However  you needn't go as far as NYC, one need only to go up a few blocks to Jupiter to find better quality with a choice.  Whoever heard of putting corn on pizza, yuk.  Again you can get a selection at other places so if you don't care for corn or pineapple on pizza you can simple order something else.Another  thing the women with hairy armpits serving the cheese I guess were in vogue in the sixties as some misconception of being European but they are definitely  out of it today. Get into the 21st century !!"
14,I really really really want to go here but as a working professional the hours of business make this shop nearly inaccessible. Who the hell closes at 6pm??? They're in the the Gourmet Ghetto! Do they really expect interest in cheese buying to dramatically drop off after 6pm? Sometimes I hate Berkeley.
