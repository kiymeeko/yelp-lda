0,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
1,"This used to be my fiance's favorite restaurant, but the food was just okay this last time we went. The shiitake mushrooms were burned, and the tofu was bland. The wagyu beef was not worth the money. Chicken meatball, hearts, thigh with leek and bacon/mochi yakitori were good. The biggest turnoff was the terrible service. My fiance and I and our two friends at our table ordered on separate bills. My fiance and my food came out at an okay pace, but our friends' was slow and one of the dishes they were waiting on possibly got misdelivered to another table. Our waitress never brought the raw chicken menu we asked for, and she disappeared throughout the entire service. On top of this, the food is expensive (it has always been expensive but was worth it before). The atmosphere, however, is unique in the Bay Area and feels authentic."
2,Man what a disappointing experience. Got a reservation to bring the wife for her birthday. Sit down and look at the menu. We pick out about 15 things we want to try and ask the waitress if we should just order a few at a time or if we should order all at once and she can make sure everything is spaced out appropriately. She assured us that she would make sure everything was spaced out. 10 minutes later every dish gets dumped on the table at the same time. We got to enjoy about 3 of them while they were still hot. Everything else was cold. Cold fried and grilled foods are not good. The food was probably great while it was warm. I complained and they seemed sympathetic but gave it an oh well attitude. Spent $100 on a bad meal. I strongly recommend avoiding until they figure out the service side of the business.
3,"Went there on a Sat evening without reservation and got seated by the kitchen. We went after reading NYT 36 hour travel page and therefore had high expectation of the exotic plates they serve. We ordered Michi wrapped in bacon(unimpressive, didn't taste mochi nor bacon), corn frittata(good), halibut sashimi style(good), chicken heart skewer(chewy and no taste), grilled squid(small squid and tasteless), Japanese whisky cocktail called Iwai Kuro(good). Shishamo(so so). Overall, service is good. The restaurant is small but interesting. Food quality is mixed, portion is small with not small price tags. Too bad we were not impressed."
4,"Before all these izakayas opened in Sac, I had bookmarked Ippuku for a while. There is no sign outside that states the name of the restaurant, so at first I was wondering if we were at the right place. Make reservations! Even though it was a weekday, we were told it was a hour and half wait for a table. Luckily, there was an open spot right next to the entrance. I loved the ambiance- great place for a date. There were several seating arrangement, including booths and tables where you took off your shoes and sat on the floor. Signs posted discourages photos, so I didn't take any as it was dark anyways. Before eating, we were given towels to wash our hands with.Now onto the food... As an appetizer, we were given cabbage salad. I really wanted to try their chicken tartare, but it's only available on certain days. We ordered: karaage (deep fried chicken), bacon wrapped mochi, dungness crab croquettes, grilled rice balls w/ tare, and squid ink fried rice. The chicken was my favorite, crispy and tender. The rice balls were my least favorite as I wished it was filled with something. The most interesting dish was the fried rice. I've tried squid ink pasta before, and was looking forward to their fried rice. We all enjoyed it, but agreed that it was salty. So the reason for the 2 stars, is the $7 per person table charge as gratuity. Unless you order a lot of food, that is rather steep. It ended up being more than a 40% tip. It's more reasonable for them to add a set percentage instead. While I enjoyed the food for the most part, nothing wowed me enough that will warrent another visit from me."
5,My friend Patty tried to make a reservation but was told they don't accept people in wheelchairs until after 9pm. It's almost like the independent living movement and the Americans with Disabilities Act never happened.  They have good food here but it's not worth the price of discrimination.
6,This place is HORRIBLE.The service is bas as FUCK. No reservation allowed.The servant always ignores any words from customer.
7,"Ugh, I always come back to places that I rate 5 star in my head, then want to leave a review and finally get a chance to after a 3rd or 2nd visit. And of course then the visit is totally different... oh Ippuku , why did it have to be you as well...So basically I've come to the conclusion that all the hot sake last time was the reason for my 5 star experience . Our server today seemed rushy and not too interested in us. We also came at 5:30 with reservations and plenty of open tables so being ""too busy"" couldn't have been an excuse.Dish after dish came out bland and blander. I was living off the soy sauce and dry peppers mixture with every bite to choke the food down. If you look you look at my first grilled squid picture u can see the second one has shrunk greatly in size . The tentacles were also so burnt and dry. The dipping sauce also tasted like it came straight from a Mayo bottle. Wasn't there a hint of lemon last time ?Chicken meatball was so wet inside the entire thing fell apart. Bacon wrapped mochi - I still like the contrast of the salty crispy bacon and the soft melted mochi, however, it lost its magic to me.Guy no Tataki - I felt sick later after eating this.Soba noodles tasted dry and grainy and the soup broth nothing special .Momo  - Yes it was chicken thigh, yes it tasted like chicken thigh, anything special? NO.We should have just left once we found out that there is no squid rice on Mondays or Tuesday's, just a cold buckwheat noodle in its place. Yeah not a happy camper .$82 later we are looking for another place to grab a drink and some snacks . We won't be back.For Japanese tapas go to Kiraku instead ."
8,"I'm a huge fan of Asian bbq, from Chinese to Japanese versions. However, though the food here is decent, it is not worth the price as well as the wait, unless you're here to get drunk AND snack. My review might be biased because of my numerous past experiences eating at izakayas in Taiwan that are much cheaper and more flavorful.The exterior and interior decorations of this place are very authentic, Japanese, and unique. It feels like I've been transported to Japan, with all the wooden materials, Japanese-style group seatings, and secluded couple seatings. The squid ink fried rice was the most flavorful dish of all, with a nice juicy, slightly oily texture. It might not be the best thing to eat on a first date. The bacon mochi was alright. It had a lack of flavor since mine had too much mochi and not enough of the crispy, flavorful bacon. The chicken heart skewer was delicious. The texture was chewy and the hearts had a smoky taste. The pork belly skewer was tender and juicy. I also ordered a few other skewers, but after a while, they all start to taste the same except for the difference in the textures. I also enjoyed the grilled squid, which came with a side of mayonnaise with spices mixed in. The squid had a nice charred flavor and was very fresh and tender. However, I recommend sharing this dish as it can get a bit monotonous to eat.Overall, this is a great place for gatherings and celebrations, especially if you want small dishes and good sake and mixed drinks. However, I must warn you that the prices are quite high."
9,"This review will be for two visits, rather 1.5 to be more accurate. The first was fantastic and the second not so much.Ippuku was on my list to try for a very long time and was ecstatic when I was finally able to dine there earlier this year.  The set up is amazing and made me feel as if I were back in Asia. My friend and I arrived around the dinner rush and the place was completely packed.  The wait time was roughly a hour but we were able to find a spot at the bar and proceeded to order both drinks and food.  Our order consisted of 2 omakase, large squid, (I believe) beef intestine, a couple beers, and four orders of Yamazaki 18. The total bill came out to approx. $375, $200 of it was the whiskey, and I could not have been more pleased. The food was delicious, ambiance was fantastic, and bar tender/service was great. Definitely a spot to come back to.Fast forward to this past weekend. I walk up to the bar before 930pm, with a close friend of mine hoping to get a quick bit knowing they close at 10pm, and was immediately rejected by a Caucasian lady standing at the computer next to the bar.  We were told the kitchen is closed however we can still have a drink for the next 30min prior to them closing.  I asked if they close the kitchen 30 minutes prior every night and was told not always, it depends. Very odd response since the restaurant was full, even odder when the (same) bar tender asked if I were staying for drinks and wanted to order food. Now I have plenty of friends and know the kitchen does close early but 30 minute prior with a full restaurant? Clearly she just did not want to serve us. Very disappointing."
10,"I went in with high expectations given the reviews. The night started with a 40 minute wait for the table that turned into over an hour, followed by decent but unremarkable food and dismal service. We had to give up on one of the dishes after reminding our waitress multiple times that it was missing. I won't be returning."
11,"Service: Horrible. Basically if you want a water or need some napkins it'll take you more than 5 minutes to flag a server down. Food: I expected something very delicate and delicious before going in. Unfortunately the dishes are only delicate but nowhere near delicious. I do not remember anything I ate for that night, because I didn't like any of them. There was one exception: the tofu. It was disgusting. I hated it. So much. Overall, everything I tasted/experienced warned me not to back again. I will NOT recommend this to anyone. I really don't understand why this place has four stars...I'd rather starve than waste my money here. For the record, I do love Japanese tapas and Kiraku in Berkeley is my absolute favorite."
12,"I wish I could say the food here was better than the service, but both were abysmal. We arrived early to check on the wait time. We put in our names and were told it was a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes of standing around the bar, we ask how much longer the wait would be. They told us another 30 minutes.We waited for another hour before finally being seated in the back next to the grills which blew smoke all around the area.The service was nonexistent. The food was pricy, but understandable if it was good. Unfortunately, our grilled squid arrived burned and cold. The chicken gizzard was also cold by the time it arrived and did not taste fresh. In fairness the Mochi wrapped in bacon tasted fine.The worst part of the evening was when we FOUND A BLACK HAIR on our beef skewers (definitely didn't belong to anyone at our table). The host promptly removed the plate and brought back the exact same two pieces on a new plate. Avoid this place if you dislike hair in your food and poor service."
13,"Horrible service. When you waited for 2 hours and the manager be like ""hey just leave I am glad you wait two hours but I am also glad you are not my customers. Not gonna serve you this evening"". People just come because there is always a long line, but longer lines do not mean better food or server attitude. Funny and pathetic how people get easily influenced by things that appear on the surface."
14,Underseasoned. Too much mayo. None of the desserts were available.I was looking for creative cuisine and fresh flavors. That did not happen.I couldn't wait to leave. Go here for the chicken. Get some sake or beer.Enjoy the atmosphere.Leave it at that.
15,"Lack of reservations: 5 stars. yayRidiculous amount of no cellphone signs: 5 stars-- there was one approximately every 2 feet. Like geez, we aren't actually in Japan. You cute lil pretentious restaurant, you~~~Efficacy of the signs: 2 stars, see Photos sectionVibe: 5 stars. Amazing. Really like the decor and booths and stuff.Price of the food: 2 stars. Spent like $70 and I could've eaten a bowl of ramen and some appetizers elsewhere for $15 and probably would've felt just as/ more satisfied.Pork belly: 4 stars. Tasty. Warm. Juicy. A+ but you know, there were 4 pieces for $$$.Fava bean thing: 1 star. Why did we get this? This was so mediocre. And it was still $$$.Musubi soup: 3 stars. Tasty. But I can grill a musubi and put it in some broth at home for like $5.Grilled mochi w/ bacon: 5 stars. Omggg very good. Still $$$. Gonna make this at home.Drinks: 2 stars. Mediocre. Not really flavorful-- I mean, I guess I'm not sophisticated enough. But the plum+sake cocktail that I had was pretty blegh. It was like drinking watery alcohol with some ume pieces and residue at the bottom. And $$$.Honestly, it's just hyped up. It's good. But like, I'm tired of hype-y expensive Japanese food. Like how dare ya'll grill two rice balls and charge $7."
16,Very Rude!!! Won't return to this place. Turned me away when I asked for a single seat even though they had available seating. Lost a good customer who doesn't mind spending a lot for good food. Disappointment!!
17,"Took our name on the list and told us no table available after two hours. Didn't allow us drink anything while we are wait outside in cold weather. Super disappointed, and will never be their customer ever again."
18,"It was easy enough to call and make a reservation. No menu was available online, but the place had been written up by the SF Chronicle as one of the top 100 restaurants of the Bay Area, and I'd only heard good things. What could go wrong?We were seated promptly, and the seating is really quite charming, but it went downhill from there. I don't know if it's due to the flat service charge or whether our waitress just wasn't very good, but food came out so ... slowly.  We were a party of 5, so since there were 2 skewers per plate, we would order 3 plates of a particular dish.  They came one plate at a time, with 10-15 minutes in between.All of the dishes tasted the same, whether it was chicken, pork or vegetarian: grilled.  There was very little to distinguish one dish from another, so it really tasted like we were eating the same dish all evening ... just very, very slowly.The final straw came when we ordered dessert, and the dessert dishes came before the last plate of an order arrived.  We asked for the final plate to be cancelled.We THEN had to wait another 15 minutes while our waitress whisked past us numerous times, actively avoiding eye contact.  When we asked for the check, she seemed surprised, even though we had eaten and drank everything.The ordeal took over two hours.  That's pretty typical when you're enjoying a good meal, but what we encountered was a two-plus hour waiting period, punctuated by moments of food.No thanks."
19,"A nice looking venue and respectable food. The portions are smaller than what I expect. Above average in price.  What is atrocious is the $7/person service charge, added before tax. This amount is not justified given the inattentive service here. It took us more than ten minutes to flag a waitress to take our order. Not a place I would recommend."
20,"It's hard to understand the positive reviews.  I found Ippuku a distinctively hostile environment.  I found the food had a single flavor profile: salty.  The service was uncaring. We made a reservation the day before and were still asked to wait outside for 10-15 minutes. The place was filled with signs warning me not to use my cell phone. I figure, when I pay $100 for a meal, I shouldn't be admonished like a child. The menu was filled with warnings and notices. We'll charge you $6 per person fee in addition to the exorbitant cost of the food, regardless of the service.  There are some dishes which come with fees in addition to that. The sound system was loud and muffled.  I raised my hand to ask a server what was a particular dish she was carrying. She pretended not to hear or see me.  Our appetizer came after the meal with no hint of an apology. I've been treated better and had a generally more satisfying dining experience at In 'N Out Burger.  I have no problem paying top dollar for a well crafted meal and a fun evening out.  My experience at Ippuku was not that. It was expensive and uniquely unpleasant."
21,"Definitely not coming back.Worst was that the chicken (not tartare, mind you - the yakitori) came out seared, but completely raw in the middle.  We asked for it to be cooked, as it wasn't just a little pink.  Server came back like two minutes later.  When we took the chicken off the stick, it was still raw.  At that point I asked for the check and took it home to cook.Rewind to the beginning of the experience.  It took a good 20 min for the server to check if we were ready to order, and she seemed aloof or bothered that we had questions about the menu and weren't ordering drinks.  They refuse to sell you a bowl of rice (it's specifically printed on the menu they won't sell you a rice by itself, but we hadn't noticed that).  I've never been anywhere in Japan that has rice, but won't give you a bowl of it.  The fish was overcooked and hard.  I guess that balanced out the raw chicken.There were empty cardboard boxes stacked up on top of the seating areas clearly visible.  Acceptable for a hole-in-the wall with good food, but not for a place trying to be upscale.  Similarly, the $7 per person seating charge was steep for the quality.  The menu stated this fee and said appetizers would be served.  We got one laughably small bowl with a wedge of cabbage and a squirt of dressing for four people.  It was fine, but nothing special about the presentation, and the dressing tasted the same as you'd get off the shelf of a Japanese grocer.Pros:The soups were tasty.  When I ordered the menu items by the Japanese names, the server repeated them back to me with good pronounciation."
22,"Bad experience. Got there with my family 30 mins before they opened, we were the first group there. After they opened, the waitress told us that they do not have table for a group of 4 people and did not attempt to offer any option."
23,"We ate here last night, first timers. Everything was great until we got home and both came out with food poisoning. Vomiting, nausea, and all the other things that are unpleasant followed."
24,"This place is deceptively expensive. They charge $7 per meal regardless of what you order. We ordered two tiny bowls of food and ended up paying around $35. The food was only mediocre, as well - nothing worth the outrageous price."
25,"On my 3rd visit to this restaurant, at 7pm on a Thursday, the food and service were great. 4 or 5 stars. I reserved a tatami room. Next to us was a group of 20+ loud and obnoxious people - looked like a start-up going out for some celebrating. They behaved like a a group of frat guys during Happy Hour at Hooters. They were so loud and annoying it was hard to speak to our server. Why would a great restaurant accommodate such a large group in the main section of their restaurant? It ruined the nice setting and atmosphere - which tainted the entire evening. Ippuku isn't a sports bar - you need to think of al of your patrons."
26,"This place is over rated and over priced. To charge so much for yakitori, they should know how to grill correctly. Many of the things on the menu were not available and then the chicken that I received were not done properly. I love yakitori and had some of the best stuff NY and other places like Kiraku but this place was tasteless and everything was underdone. The waitress didn't blink an eye when I left most of my food untouched (didn't want a case of food poisoning seeing I don't like spending my weekend over the toilet) and told her it was raw. She pretty much looked at me like I have two heads. ""Yes, check please is all I could say"". Not to mention we were two people and they charge us pre tip at 25%. Probably because they knew their food is poor. I'm not sure how they could have gotten a 4 star rating, perhaps all the filtering. I was terribly disappointed. I know they put signs up about raw food now, I guess the someone must have gotten food poisoning just glad it wasn't me."
27,"To start off I had a pretty good time here, food was decent and service was good. Though what spoiled my evening was when my friend and I exited the restaurant. I tried to take a pic of the exterior of the restaurant and was YELLED AT by the bartender 'HEY, NO PICTURE!' okaaaay. Well it's a public area, and we just paid a lot of money to eat at this restaurant so being yelled was terribly upsetting. Not only is it my legal right to be able to take pics of public areas, but the bartender could have asked nicely. Really ruined the entire experience for me, I'll not be returning."
28,"The fitment is nice but only the special one is the squid ink fried rice. But if one person need finish the rice it's too oily. And when we check , they charge 18% service fee for two people already. It's the reason we don't want come back again!"
29,"Finished class at an executive course at the business school and found this authentic izakaya in downtown Berkeley. The food was authentic enough - had some juicy and succulent chicken karaage, chicken wing, and delicious pork belly from Okinawa. Tasted just as good as it would in Tokyo, so pleasantly pleased by that. What I couldn't believe was the astronomical price for these few dishes! Tokyo is an expensive place and this was easily double the prices there. The few items plus a pint of beer was $45! Service was very rigid too. Just wanted a simple bowl of rice to go with the pork belly. But no, instead the waitress tried to upsell me to an over priced bowl of ten-don instead. So food authentic, prices unreasonably high like it's some kind of high end exotic thing when it's not, service non-Japan like."
30,"Everything was a bit too salty and msg heavy for me.  The buckwheat noodles were soaked in soy sauce while grilled squid dish could have been more tender. Bacon wrapped mochi tasted similar to pan fried rice cakes. Pork belly skewer was by far the most tasty out of all our selections tonight. In summary, over priced yakitori for mediocre quality..."
31,"We went here on NYE anticipating an amazing dining experience, given all the reviews. That was not the case. The first 5 items we tried to order, they were all out of. Apparently, as the server told us, the owners didn't order more food in anticipation of NYE because they were going to be closed for a week following. So disappointing, that's terrible management.What we did have was ok, but again it was all of our second choices because they didn't have anything we wanted initially. The jury is out on if we will go again and give it another try. I can forgive being out of food on a busy night, but because the management chose not to order more in anticipation is inexcusable. Our reservation was at 730 too, no where near a time that restaurants run out."
32,"It is so sad to see how this restaurant's service gone down for the past year or two and so was the food. It's interesting to see how service starts deteriorating after they implement the mandatory 6dollars per person charge. I don't mind paying the price is the service is up par. Unfortunately, they forgot 2 orders....I mean the service wasn't even busy. Come on Ippuku, you can do better than that...I'm counting on you! But for now, I will stay away from you for a while. Sorry!"
33,"I read the reviews and was expecting spectacular food. It was mediocre. The cheese dish with honey that everyone recommended wasn't available, totally bummed.  The portions are super tiny and the chicken skewers with teriyaki are  pretty gross. I also had the Sweet potato and it was actually burnt, the server told me it was supposed to be that way. Huh Burnt, really..? He was attentive otherwise. The disgusting electronica noise coming from the bar will make us NEVER go back again and the $7 tip they take per person is ridiculous. You're not that good ~"
34,"I had to write my first review for this place. We were a group of four and we ordered lots of food and two possibly three rounds of sake. After our food was done a gentlemen came and brought us another sake bottle. He poured the sake into our glasses and as we were about to take a sip our waitress comes and asks us if we ordered the sake. We said ""no but we thought it might have been a nice gesture since we had Ordered so much."" The waitress proceeds to take the  cups from each of our hands - mind you I had just drank from mine already. I saw the gentlemen signaling to her to leave it and she refused. I have never in my life had a drink taken from my hand by anyone. If THEY had given the drink to us erroneously that wasn't our fault -and to take it away? Are you serious? What was she going to do with the sake - serve it to someone else? Makes me wonder if had previously sipped sake. GROSS!"
35,"The wait staff were wonderful, as usual.The kitchen was very slow, and far from top of their game.  The imported Hokkaido flour soba was painfully undercooked in the ten zaru, and adequate in an unimaginative tempura soba.  I've enjoyed and admired Ippuku's tempura off their dinner menu, so the lunch vegetable tempura appetizer was a shock:  oily and soggy, with the vegetables much too awkwardly sliced to be enjoyable.Sorry, but I'll probably head elsewhere for soba."
36,"Update: on 11/16/14, we arrived in a party of two and later were presented with a bill that includes 20% gratuity. I'm all for paying the servers but it is not ok to add service charge without letting patrons know in advance.Ippuku is a cool place for dinner with family or a date with someone special or even dinner for one.  they have small hight booth seating with bamboo curtain that offers the privacy one might need or a large table for group of 10.Bacon wrapped mochi: sticky, chargrilled smoky flavor mochi inside crispy bacon. Very tasty and a must have item.Bacon wrapped enoki: enoki is a type of mushroom and this dish is a perfect combination of flavors. It is very small so consider it's a teaser unless you order extras.Grilled Hokkaido squid: excellent dish! The squid is grilled so well, it is neither too dry nor rubbery. It's also a dish that offers a lot for your money as the squid is large and meaty.Squid ink fried rice: good but not excellent.  The black rice (from squid ink) is pretty cool, it does turn your tongue black so ladies, if you're on a date, consider you're warned.Chicken cartilage: I love this dish! How they can make cartilage, a tasteless thing, becomes so tasty is beyond me.Pork belly skewer: very delicious although recently it seems like they use thinner and leaner pieces which decrease the flavor, texture, and taste of the dish.The green tea ice cream dessert is a joke; I had it once and hate it.  It tastes cheap like McDonalds soft serve. Get the sweet potato pie instead.Full bar, fully stocked sake bar and super nice bartender."
37,"Food is pretty good...  but service is extremely poor!!  First, we called and try to make a reservation, they told us there is no need cos wait time for table is approx 15 mins...  Ok, when we got there, we put our names down and we told them we are going buy a drink next door really quick; we came back in less than 15mins, they said we were not there, so they gave our table to someone else...which we already told me we were just next door buying a drink.  Ok, then, what's next...  we were totally ignored...  we waited almost 2 hours for a table....  then, after they seated us, they didn't come by to take orders, not even give us the wet towels, or tea/water.  Then, during the meal, they keep bringing us (at least 3 times) food that we did not order.  Ended up to be next table's.  And we had to stop our meal to keep calling them every time.  Their attitude was also very rude.  Also, only 2 of us went, they charge us 17% gratuity on check automatically, we were like ""what da""?!  17% for that kind of services?!"
38,"I would never recommend this place to a friend or anyone to come here because it is just simply does not provide a great experience.It took a while for us to get seated even though we have a reservation because the hostess was extremely busy in the back doing something, which left the front unattended. Not just for a few minutes, but for quite some time. In this case, I would recommend having two hostess so that it can provide a more pleasant and seamless experience for customers.We waited for 25 - 30 minutes before the waitress finally came to us. They barely have any food for us. There were tons of things that we wanted that they could not make us because they don't have it in inventory or their machine (black sesame dessert!!! What we really looked forward to) has been broken... Everything was seriously not available - about 5 - 7 items from the menu. Meh."
39,"So, here's the thing about Ippuku. The food tastes wonderful. The atmosphere is great and unlike any restaurant I've been to. My husband and I have eaten there twice before, and had no complaints other than, perhaps, the steep pricing. The reason I'm giving it a ""1"" however, has to do with food poisoning. There's a little card they have on every table, warning the diner about (among other things) under-cooked chicken. They're not kidding, and I hugely suggest it not be ignored. In taking it lightly (it lists a bunch of things, and sushi or carpaccio have never hurt me, so I didn't think too hard about it), we ended up with a solid case of food poisoning - Norovirus is my best guess, but I could be wrong about the type. Two days to recover.Poultry - at least from wherever they're getting it - isn't meant to be eaten ""raw or under-cooked"". All their chicken skewers are under-cooked by default - it gives them a lovely, velvety texture you may not have experienced before - but trust me, they weren't worth getting that sick over.So while I hate to give a bad review, I feel it only right to warn folks. The food *tasted* great, but sadly, we'll never go back."
40,"Very special food. The food itself deserves 4-5 stars, but the ambience and management zero. Thus, I am landing on a 2.I have been here several times.  However, the management has become so problematic that I may not return. First t here is the hassle of making a reservation. You call them. They call you later on to confirm.  To finalize confirmation, you have to call back again. Last time I was There, there was a party of 25 who could not be seated quickly, so the hostess had them stand in the aisle between tables instead of in the front which is the normal procedure. And they did party, so loudly that it ruined our dinner and that of several others. The hostess was apologetic, but did not ask them to move. The wait persons had trouble getting by them to bring food. This kind of customer ""service"" is a good way to ruin a business. I know it was ruined for me."
41,"My rating is this low not because this place was so bad, but because my experience was so disappointing. The dishes we ordered were mostly fine but nothing wowed me. I love scallops, which were the fish special. They came raw over grilled vegetables, all cold, which I was not expecting, with a gloppy fishy-tasting sauce I found unpleasant. I ate only a couple bites. The other dishes--maitake tempura, chicken udon soup, goat cheese with honey (grilled but served at room temperature and difficult to get into bites), and a chocolate mochi soup--were just not that exciting. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things and could have used more guidance, or just aren't the right audience, though I consider myself an adventuresome eater. And it was pricey. All the little dishes added up quickly on the bill."
42,"I really really wanted to find a local Yakitori restaurant since relocating here from Southern California.  I used to go to Shinsengumi in Torrance a couple of times a month.  I went by myself around 5:15pm last Saturday.  When I told the maitre d' it was for one, she said she would have to check with the patron sitting at the counter area before she could sit me.  I had to check back twice before she finally got around to asking the patron at the counter area.  I stood at the bar area for about 20 minutes even though there were tables available and other couples with no reservations were seated before me.  She even sat a couple at the counter who came in after me.As for the food, it really SUCKED!!!  I have had Yakitori at many restaurants.  It is one of my favorite foods.  All the food was BURNT!  I ordered the chicken liver and gizzards which were my favorites.  The liver was charred to a blackened crisp on the edges and tasted bitter.  Then there was the issue of whether I could order the 5 item tasting menu.  They flip-flopped 3 times about whether I could order it because they were out of organs.  I was seated around 5:45pm.  When a waitress gave me the plate, it was the same old charred at the corners deal.  Perhaps the chefs have been to the the East Coast too much and fell in love with blackened steak.  Sadly the delicate preparation of Yakatori is completely lost on them.  They need to go back to Japan for a refresher.The one star is for the bartender who explained to me the food is overcooked because people had complained when livers were prepared medium rare.  I hate to say it but the Bay Area is supposed to be a foodie paradise.  I have no idea why you would create such an ABOMINATION of Yakitori.  Food is prepared medium rare all the time at various restaurants.  Even though Anne Burrell may say ""burnt food tastes good,"" she's never been to this restaurant."
43,"I was very excited to try the soba, as they specially advertised it was made in store and with flour flown in from Hokkaido. I also figured it was a $15 a bowl for a reason right? No, no reason at all actually.I could not tell the difference between these noodles and the ones I make I from the store. They tasted practically the same, with the store-bought noodles winning out.Also, my father (who lived in Japan for 10 years) was also not pleased by the presentation. Usually, you get your noodles, sauce, and tempura in three separate containers so that you dip your noodles in the sauce each and every time. Here, I had a sauce container which the waitress told me to pour all over my noodles and tempura, all put together in the same bowl. Terrible mistake. Sauce was too salty and the noodles drenched in this, was not a tasty experience.The tempura was good though, but $15 for all of this? No, thanks. I was expecting something like Randy T's experience from below, but experienced nothing like it.There's a wide variety of drinks at night though. However, during the day and at night, service is really slow. I feel the only way to get a waiter around here is to flag them down and you're lucky if they will look your way. I have had one waiter pretend not to see my table. There was another time at night that they were slow that I left for another bar. Sure, the atmosphere here is nice, but when you're hungry and waiting for a ridiculous amount of time, nothing matters except that growling in your belly.For this type of food and way better service, I'll just head to Kiraku on Telegraph."
44,"Ippuku seems to forget that Berkeley is a college town, it still is and will still be for a long time. High or even moderately priced restaurants don't last long if they don't cater to the significant student population in the area. If you're going to charge that much, your food has better be damn good. If you're going out for a drink, the accompanying food might be good, but if you expect to get full, be ready to spend a good bit of cash. I simply wanted a bowl of noodles and ended up with some soba that doesn't taste any different from what I can make at home."
45,Food is very good but the wait is more than an hour.  By the time we got our table all items with broth base are out like ramen and udon.
46,"To be honest I don't really understand the hype about this place. The wait was excruciatingly long and the food, though plated adorably, tasted mediocre and bland. Bacon wrapped mochi was too soft and sticky and the karaage chicken was nauseatingly oily. Crab croquettes were alright. The servers were warm and accommodating but given the price, I don't think I'd return."
47,"Not good for large groups due to small seating spaces.Not good for kids, unless they are proficient in the use of chopsticks. Yes, they did not have a fork to offer my child. Even in Japan, a kid can get a fork in a restaurant.We found the menu to be very tough to read, and ended up not ordering enough food.I wanted to order a Coke for my kid. ""No Coke, only Japanese soda."" Couldn't even get a description, other than it was Japanese. Gee whiz, they even sell Coke (or equivalent) in restaurants in Japan. There doesn't seem to be much else to drink there except tea and alcohol. Portions are tiny, though very good.One of our items never arrived, and our server conveniently disappeared for more than 30 minutes. When we finally caught her, she told us that they were still waiting to cook this item. Makes no sense, as everything else had come out long earlier, and we were done eating. The dining experience was awkward, and I tend to tie it into the bad service. We, a party of 8, were obviously unsure of what to order, and how. It would have been nice for the server to guide us through the menu and help us order properly. Instead of ordering another round of food, we ran down the street to a neighboring Indian restaurant...We weren't thrilled about having a 17% tip tacked onto our bill after the server pulled a disappearing act, but we paid it anyway. Instead, she gets this less-than-stellar review, warning her to take care of her customers if she's going to expect a tip. Gratuities are earned, and they awarded based on the level of service."
48,"No. I'm sorry Ippuku but I really didn't like you. Everyone is subject to their own opinion, and personally I thought Ippuku is WAY overrated. Although their menu seems to have some inspiring dishes but everything was overpriced. Maybe I've been spoiled by having been to great izakaya's in past, but I found their dishes pretty generic, expensive and not flavorful."
49,"I would have giving Ippuku 5 stars for the three amazing dinners I had there, but they lose 4 due to the crap I experienced at lunch today. After having a great noodle high from Peko Peko's udon to The Ramen Shop's bowls of freshness, I decided to round out my noodle fantasy with soba lunch at Ippuku. They claim they have soba flour for Hokkaido and make fresh noodles on the spot. I walked in (by myself) at 12:30pm and noticed a space at the counter in the back of the restaurant, asked if I could sit. The hostess told me the wait was for 30 mins and pointed at two couples sitting in their front tables waiting and told me to sit with them. Not sure why they weren't offering table service there the same way they do at dinner. After waiting for ten minutes I overheard the waitresses discussing in Japanese (yes, I understand Japanese ladies, so the next time you want to talk shit, best do it out of earshot of your customers) on who was going to get soba and who wasn't and they decided that it would be me. Fair enough, I was the last one in as far as I knew. The waitress tells me, ""we are out of soba, next time come at 11am, because at noon we have no idea if we will have any"", then ushered me out the door. I have two big problems with this statement. Their ""soba lunch"" hour is between 11am-2pm. If they know that at noon they'll be running out of soba then a) why don't they plan better and make a tad bit more soba? b) make the lunch hours from 11am- 12:30pm since they see a pattern of running out of noodles so quickly?My other big problem is they have other stuff on the menu, which I would have been happy to stay and eat those items, but they didn't even offer it. Not sure why they had an issue with me where they didn't want to have me eat there. It's too bad, because their dinner service is good and these waitresses work the night shift too, I've seen them there. I think their lunch service is wonky as hell. Very disappointing."
50,"Got here at 700pm and informed that there was a 1 hour wait.  We were willing.  Oh what a mistake.We actually waited 1.5 hours for our table.  By the time we sat down, we were ready to order but for some reason the couple next to us who got seated after us got their order in before us, got their first dish, AND finished their first dish before the waitress even started to acknowledge us !! As we were ordering, half of what we wanted to order was SOLD OUT.  No squid ink rice.  No pork belly.  No uni.  No cartilage.  Well hell, if I waited 1.5 hours it would have been nice to know that everything we came to try  was not available.... the restaurant should really invest in a chalkboard or something to put in the front to let waiting customers know what the kitchen is out of.  We were seated right by the kitchen so there was constant smoke blowing into our faces.  Our clothes stank after dinner.  Were we asked if we wanted to sit by the noisy greasy kitchen?  No.  And since the kitchen was running out of food, we got to see the chefs firsthand stressed out with looks of 'How many more orders are there??' and towards the end the chefs were barking at the waitresses/waiters 'I have no more food!  No more food!'  That's not what you want to hear at a restaurant.  If your restaurant is THAT popular, you best come up with a way to meet the demand, or to turn away people so they don't waste their time waiting for an empty kitchenYes, the food itself was very delicious.  Granted, we only got 1/2 of what we wanted to try, but everything we had was very good.  Expensive.  But good.  Good job chefs.  BUT PLEASE ! Work on PROMPT SERVICE and actually HAVING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN.  Thanks."
51,"kiraku is better. now let's start. the only 2 food thing they have was the grill pork belly and karage. but of course pork belly was really good at kiraku as well. their karage is a must try i would say, their batter is very different, almost taste like donuts. i think they put alot of milk in to it. which is very good. ramen is the nastiest i have ever tried. thank god we got the mini one. soup taste nasty, i would rather eat top ramen. like is really that bad. the grilled wings has no flavor, their grilled giant squid is huge disappointment. places like this should have the best grill squid! it was dry and not chewy. compare with kiraru which i also have a review at, you can see the big difference just how each ring stands. i really like these small japanese food bars. but this is just one disappointment. the environment is great but besides that food is very so so."
52,"I don't get it...I don't care how great raw chicken may taste, I am WHITE and I have an OLD MAN stomach. There was nothing there that I was willing to risk eating."
53,"Not my bag. Some interesting small plates - a couple were delicious.  However it is completely overpriced, the plates are too small, and they were out of a bunch of stuff.  Probably wont be back, but it was a cool place to try once.Highly recommend the oyster (tasted like bacon), bacon wrapped mochi, and fried chicken."
54,"Just a heads up MAKE RSVP. I was excited about this place because I am a fan of izakaya but when we came they didn't have a lot of items on the menu. I really wanted to try the raw chicken but they said they took it off the menu, but will be bringing it on their other menu or something. But nothing fancy about this place and they're little itty bitty cups of water they had to come refill a millions times."
55,"Great service, cozy ambience. But overall, the dining experience was just okay. Gimmicky and over-priced Japanese appetizers, with limited options for the non-carnivorous set. Highlight was the green onion pancake. The bill came to $100 for three people (which included a $6 per person ""table charge,"" and on the way home, I deliberated stopping for a sandwich so I wouldn't go to bed hungry."
56,"Well I tried to experience this place, but unfortunately was not given the time of day by the bartender. I guess they don't need/want my money.Walked in and approached the small bar inside. Stood there for literally 10 minutes while the bartender attended to patrons who were getting their bill and cleaned up their area. Then he had a chat with a co-worker, then he started cleaning more, and then he grabbed a water pitcher to go fill glasses for diners. While he was doing the above tasks he looked at me standing there multiple times, yet never made any attempt to serve me. Bizarre."
57,"I came here after class to unwind. We walked in and stood there for a while staring at the staff that was having a conversation.  I had to wave one of them down to be greeted (-1 pt.).The decor was modern japanese chic with the wooden booths and cement walls, but I was really thrown off by the cowboy music.......it felt like they tried too hard to be different (-1 pt.).service-nice.Our table was sticky, but they were quick to clean that (-1 pt.).  We were asked several times if we wanted anything to drink and they seemed shocked that we didn't order alcohol.  I understand it's an izakaya, but I have to be up early in the morning so I passed on the alki (-1 pt.).We ordered:pork belly-never got it (-4 pts......it's a no no to deprive me of my pork belly!).dungeoness crab croquette-filled with ooey gooey cheese and crab.  This was by far one of my favs for the night (+2).bacon wrapped mochi-bacon is really thin and mochi was so soft.  I really enjoyed this as well, but more bacon can't hurt lol (-1 pt.)karage-it was ok.  I prefer mine crunchier.grilled squid-only the tentacles tasted grilled the rest of it was hardly grilled.  I took a bite and it bounced back at me!  It's one of my favorite dishes at izakayas' so this was a big let down (-8 pts.).omakase chicken skewers: wings, hearts, skin, thigh, and thigh with leeks.  The thigh skewer was raw (-10 pts).....I understand it's free range, but I didn't want to risk it.  It was quite a turn off.  They did replace that one skewer with another thigh & leeks skewer, but that was all they did to compensate a dirty table, raw chicken, and forgotten order of pork belly.  I had high hopes for this place, but I won't be in a hurry to come back."
58,"Yes the food was quite tasty. And I loved the ambiance of this place. But thats where the pros end.I was with another person and we both ordered a beer. And several dishes however I ate about 80% of the food and still fairly hungry. Service was pretty poor too, my waiter was only seen when i arrived, order, and serving my food. I had wanted to order more food but figured it would take too long. For portions that small im suprised it took that long to prepare. The bill came out to $60 for something that barely fed one person and a few bites for a second. Last time I felt this disappointed I went to a venue to see a singer that sounded like farm equipment giving birth to a walrus."
59,"* decent food* terrible service* uncomfortable decor* terrible servicewe met friends there for dinner -- party of 6 total. the restaurant is not really set up for easy service for a party of 4 or more, so that's already a check in the 'con' column for the night. they have bar-top tables -- good for 2; 4-top booths for 4; and a raised booth that seats 4 comfortably, 5 uncomfortably and 6 very awkwardly. we were in the last camp.we arrived at 8:30 (reservations for 6). seated at 8:45... at what appeared to be the tail end of their dinner rush (when we left, there were only 3-4 other tables occupied). the server supplied us with two menus to share amongst us and a single small (16oz?) pot of tea and 5 (not 6) shot-glass-sized water glasses. we waited. and waited. finally someone in the group climbed out of the cabana to alert a server in the hopes to bring us more menus, another pot of tea and to take our order. this petitioning for service would soon be known as par-for-the-course for the evening.the menus -- when we finally got to see them -- were cryptic. pretty, but hard to navigate. it was our first time, but i'm not really into a restaurant being so cryptic in their offerings that it leaves a patron feeling a bit stupid... especially from a culture as gracious as the japanese. the server wasn't much help, but instead leveled a: ""when you get to a good amount, i'll let you know. you can't really order too much."" ... when we proceeded to order this-or-that, a good 1/2 of it was 86ed for the night. we'd have been better set to simply have her bring what was available and appropriate for a table of 6.the food arrived oddly staggered. the goyoza arriving last. all of it was good -- grilled meats drizzled with salt, sugar and more fat is pretty good no matter what the price point... but at $35/head, it should be quite good. the mochi was especially good, but again, wrapped with bacon and char-grilled, a shoelace would be good.the server ditched us mid-meal and handed us off to another waiter who was even more elusive... and more pretentious and from whom we had to petition the last course -- the ramen (arriving a good 20mins after the other plates).the food was tasty, but we won't be going back.oh, did i mention the service was really, really poor?[1 star for service and decor / 3 stars for food quality]"
60,"I'm a stay at home mom, my husband works in Oakland.  We both have been wanting to try out the soba for weeks but between three kids (in the summer) and him working out of the area, getting to Ippuku for lunch has not been an easy task.  This week he was in Berkeley and I managed to get the kids squirreled away so we could sneak off for an hour lunch.  We were quickly seated and offered a water carafe.  Shortly thereafter, our order was taken, both of us getting genmaicha, cold soba dishes and sununomo.  We eagerly chatted away, happy to explore a new restaurant and grateful for our brief time together kid free.  After a time chatting, I thought, ""wow, this is taking quite a while"" but decided not to worry about it as I was enjoying time with my husband.  A while later, our water carafe was refilled but still no tea, no sununomo and no soba.  No comment was spoken by our waitress and we politely halted our conversation and offered thanks.  A while later I noticed the diners at the table across from us, and who had been seated after us, had their noodles delivered.  We flagged down the waitress to inquire about the delay and only then realized it had been nearly an hour!  I planned to ask for the food to go as I had to relieve the babysitter and my husband needed to return to work.  Shortly later both she and another employee approached our table to inform us that there was some sort of glitch and that they had no more noodles.  There was an uncomfortable pause and both my husband and I decided to leave, as we were out of time to eat lunch let alone order another.  At that point we were offered an apology.  As we were walking out, one of the women asked us to wait.  She got on the phone and after 5 or more minutes she hangs up and offers a $25 gift certificate.I don't want to seem ungrateful for the gift certificate because clearly they knew they messed up but I was really disappointed.  My husband and I went out of our way to get to the restaurant, both of us missed getting a sit down lunch for the day, and we were offered a gift certificate that would barely, if at all, a meal for the both of us.  if the service was more attentive, if it didn't seem like we were a burden to them once the mistake was discovered, I'd likely not feel so negatively.  Yet I do.  And I'm not sure its worth going back to redeem that gift certificate."
61,"A very disappointing meal.We arrived right at 5pm and got a booth seat reserved for walk-ins, as the hostess assured us all other tables were booked. However later that evening, walk-ins were given regular tables. In addition, the restaurant at no point was full. The service was terrible. The waitress barely check on us and was not knowledgeable nor particularly pleasant.The food. The cabbage with aioli that was free was a tiny portion. It was okay, but when we asked for a little more, there is apparently a $3 charge. Seriously? Poor business choice.Then, we ordered the bacon wrapped mochi. The bacon was mostly the fat, and it was not crispy. The dish was very bland and I had to drench it in soy sauce. Eeek! Again, a very small portion.Then, we got a grilled squid. A bigger portion, but also more expensive. The squid was barely flavored and somewhat rubbery.The chicken neck was fairly good, but it was pretty much just grilled chicken and not at all unique as I expected . Finally, we decided on he grilled quail which is also more expensive (we hoped the portion would not be as minuscule as the other dishes). First, this last dish took more than 50 minutes. Entirely unacceptable. The waitress was not apologetic. First, she said it went to the wrong table, then later said that the wait was because they had a large party so the kitchen was busy (note: the largest party was only 8 people). When we finally got the quail, it was actually just as small and not at all noteworthy. We ate it, then decided to end the evening before any more busts.Nothing was comped, and there was no apology. Horrible experience. We left hungry and then had an amazing dessert at A Cote. I just wish we had out entire meal there. So sad."
62,So sad to see the new policy of mandatory $6 per person gratuity. We have been coming for years but with the $6 inclusive of children it no longer makes sense for us to dine here. It is very presumptuous to expect every seat to spend $30. Good luck with this policy. It feels like a set % would be a better way to approach this issue.
63,"It pains me to do this, but when you have to wait over an hour to get a small bowl of chicken ramen, that's unacceptable. Otherwise, my GF and I enjoyed this place very much.There's another review on here that explains this venue very well, so I'll try to keep mine short and only to the things I think are interesting to point out.Like the other reviews of this place, Ippuku is a very interesting venue. It uses the narrow, but tall, space it has very efficiently and still manages to be cozy. When you first visit the establishment, you'll notice that there is a bench outside, with a heater over head, for customers wanting to get a drink at the bar, but not necessarily go in the restaurant to dine. This is very cool concept and would be great for bar hopping. Inside, the outdoor bar continues, but you get a better view of the vast amount of sake variety that is available to you. You don't have to drink the sake straight either, as there are a few sake cocktails available, though be aware that the bartender is only one man, and he is constantly busy, if not at least polite.Reservations would do you well at this moment, but should you be adventurous, expect a 15 minute wait for couples and even longer for larger groups. Once a table is ready, you'll be lead deeper into the establishment. Fortunately, though we didn't make reservations, we were only two and were able to get a seat within 15 minutes. We were led to a 4-person booth, and were pleasantly surprised to find a heater under the table. Sweet.Now, as other reviewers have pointed out, this place is an izakaya. You generally come here to drink and snack on small servings. Don't be coming here with huge appetites and expect to walk away full unless you want to put a hurtin' on your wallet, but since this was the first time we had been able to be together in a while: ""Bring on the pain, playa-playah."" We ordered quickly because we managed to look over the menu while we waited to be seated. The list as itemized:- Green tea (real tea leaves used)- Meyer lemon and sake cocktail- Five skewers of various chicken parts- Scallion Pancake- Bacon wrapped mochi- Minced chicken skewer and rice bowl- Mini Chicken RamenAny place that uses real green tea leaves for their tea gets a thumbs up from me. The cocktail was nice, nothing outstanding, as the Meyer lemon wasn't as sweet as I thought it should be and the sake was already sweet anyways.The skewers were awesome, chicken gizzards and neck never tasted so good. Better than other izakayas that I've been to. Props to the grill master. The bacon-wrapped mochi was interesting, it reminded me of an Asian rice marshmallow that was melted in a slice of juicy bacon. The scallion pancake was packed with scallions and was cakey tasting. It was topped with bonito and some house sauce. I prefer Chinese style scallion pancakes, but that's just a personal preference. The minced chicken rice bowl was good too, with the rice not being too muhsy or too hard, seasoned with sweet sauce, and topped off with more scallions. This was good too and I ate every grain of rice.Which leads to the ramen... Even though we ordered early on, and eventually ordered the bacon wrapped mochi while we waited, the ramen came as the last dish, an  hour and several minutes later. With constant apologizing all the way. I wish we had seen through the apologies to just cancel the bowl of ramen and get on with our lives, but the assurances that the bowl would come soon, and later, the bowl had accidentally gone to the wrong table, a new bowl was coming, it kept us glued to our seats. Was this some mystical, home-made, delicious ramen with the impressive grilled chicken? No. It was a bowl of slightly overcooked ramen in a flavorful broth with shreds of dry, over boiled chicken.We're just too damned nice. BTW, GF made an interesting observation: Aside from the plastic drink straws, Ippuku uses mainly wood and clay utensils and items."
64,Mushroom is over cooked. No service at all. Serving is so slow! Waited an hour for dessert. Never come back again.
65,"Terrible service. The waiter seated the group after us first and left us stand at the bar area for 10mins. Ippuku was my once favorite Japanese place in berkeley, but I was so disappointed."
66,"Ambience: very cool.  So cool that you might consider dressing in a way that shows that you're very casual and unstudied about your look even though in truth you've really thought about it a lot, much as you might listen to bad country western music or Japanese pop in an ironic, ""it's so bad, it's good, don't you think?"" kind of way. To which an honest reply of ""no, I really don't care for most country western"" would be met with the kind of disdain reserved for people who, yep, chew gum while wine tasting. The food-  I really can't remember.  Quite pricey, neat interior and for us, once was enough.Mm hm, that's all I have to say, considering all the other great offerings within biking distance."
67,"I've been there twice now, neither time impressed by the food, and definitely not impressed by the serving sizes.We were seated by the bar, where they were cooking, and the vents were nowhere nearly successfully making the smoke exit. I'm pretty sure this is a major code violation. I couldn't see across the restaurant.It loses all the stars possible due to the fact that my lungs now hurt from all that smoke inhalation."
68,"the food was ok, my friends and I actually wanted to try some stuff that they have on the yelp menu. Christian (the guy with all the tattoos on his arm with black hair) took our order and kept coming back to the table saying they don't have 50% of that we ordered and the end was very rude to my friends and I. I didn't paid the bill, my friend did and he tipped 10% Christian ran after us like thieves and said we only tipped 6% saying that ""that ain't right, I just want to let you know that ain't right"" never once he asked how was the service and the reason for the tip. so my friend call the place back and took the tip off. my first time my last time sorry I had a bad experience."
69,"I was there few days ago with party of 4.  The atmosphere is very nice and food was awesome accept a bit too salty.  I will definitely come back for the food.  However, the service was awful.  We were sitting at the tatami table which we needed to take off our shoes.  The waitress & waiter were passing the dishes through the space in between my boyfriend & I.  After we finished with all the dishes, we have to ask someone to take away some of the empty dishes.  The hostess was behind me put her hand next to me and expected me to hand all the empty dishes to her without saying a word.  Her attitude was so rude.FOOD-3 starsSERVICE-1 starsOverall-the food is good but don't expect any service.Last of all, the napkins are terrible and very rough.  They are using bathroom paper towel.  I have to get my own napkins from the car."
70,"Food alone... would've probably rated it 4-stars. Though the portion sizes were definitely borderline appetizer size, the food itself was pretty yummy. The kurobuta pork with the miso sauce was especially good. Service, however, was atrocious. As someone who works in the restaurant industry, I know that sometimes shit happens in the kitchen or the front-of-the-house, and everything can get a bit behind, but waiting 30 minutes to have our order taken AND an additional 30 minutes for the first order to arrive is just unacceptable. The waiter did not even offer any form of apologies until our group confronted him about it. Additionally, there were multiple times when the wrong dishes would arrive at our table.  For an establishment that charges so much for so little, I really expect a certain level of service.Verdict: would go back but with heavy hesitation. The menu looks good and interesting, but waiting almost an hour for food is no bueno"
71,"Ippuku can be summed up as the following:  small bites, cute food, decent flavors, and a steep price.  I'm used to going to Japanese Tapa places in the South Bay so I was curious to check out Ippuku and Berkeley to see if it matches.  However, I was fairly disappointed in what I got at Ippuku because I felt the menu was pretty limited and the prices were expensive.  Not to mention some of the items were really odd... We ordered an avacado sashimi dish (thinking it's raw fish + avacado) and it turned out that it was just half an avocado with some sauce?  For 5-6$?!  The grilled items were pretty tasty, though some of it was way too salty and that was the same with the beef tataki.  We came hungry and left hungry and a whole lot poorer.  Meh.  I'll stick with the south bay."
72,"Came here for the second time and yes it was still damn expensive.   The only good reason to come here is to NOT eat!  The setup was perfectly in Japanese style with each table attached to the sitting platform (I wouldn't call them chairs) with a hole for your feet.  And YES, you have to take off your shoes before sitting yourself properly.  Don't worry about rotating your shoes in the right orientation.  They will take care of that for you.  (I guess you're paying for this, not the food)  The place definitely took me back to Japan....except noone spoke Japanese there.For $6-$15/dish, you would get a plate filled with TWO small skewers of fatty bits and pieces of chicken, or internal parts of chicken, or a small bowl of RAW (yes I meant it was taken straight from a dead chic without processing) chicken scrap topped with RAW egg.  Though this stuff definitely tasted great, I would rather go get a $7 WHOLE COOKED chicken from Safeway!  I came here hungry and left still hungry....(I just couldn't take any more weird stuff down) Their drinks selection looked interesting, but nothing spectacular."
73,45 minutes later and my eyes and nose still burn from all the smoke sitting next to the grill. =/
74,"The bathroom is the most impressive part of this restaurant (clean and artsy), the rest is well below average for its price. For the price I paid here I could have gone to a really good restaurant, such as Chez Panisse.  The food is too fatty and too salty for my taste. The menu actually warns you of the chance that you take when eating raw meat. I had raw chicken and several other things. I was not impressed. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends."
75,The atmosphere was nice but the food wasn't as good. The variety grilled chickens sticks and grilled squid had a weird smell.  The dungeness crab croquettes were flavorless and the accompanying salad was too sour.  The gyoza was the only dish I enjoyed.
76,"Being Japanese, I really wanted to love this place -- so am truly disappointed that I suffered FOOD POISONING from the chicken liver I ate at Ippuku.  I spent two days in bed  :-(The liver yakitori was pretty rare, but I've eaten that way many times in Japan, so I didn't care much.  Next evening, I couldn't sleep due to the excruciating pain in my stomach and endless trips to the bathroom...Also everything they served were too salty.  Especially the Chicken Zousui was way too salty to finish.  This place is not worth all the wait."
77,Second time going there on a Sunday. More than 7 items on their menu are NOT available. What is the point of opening when you cannot support the menu you put out. We ended up going to another Izakaya place close by which has all of their items. They were just as good.
78,"I and my husband are originally from Japan.  We heard that there is a new Izakaya (Japanese-style casual drinking and eating place) in Berkeley, so we gave a try.I should mention something good about the place first.  Their sake selection was very good.  Though still pricey, I was able to enjoy authentic Sake.  Atmosphere and architecture was nice as well.  There are enough space between the tables, so I did not have to feel crowded into a small space, (which is typically the case in Japan.)The unfortunates.  We ordered some skewers, such as Chicken skin, chicken hearts, etc, and... it was not so fresh.  Maybe my expectation was too high, as I grew up eating Yakitori (skewers) as part of my meal.  I felt that they did not either treat the skin well prior to grilling, or they simply did not check its freshness.  We also ordered Dashi-maki (cooked egg, with Japanese dashi (soup), formed in a block shape.)  Unfortunately, I thought I could do better with it.Still, I had a good time there, mainly because of the quality of Sake, and because it was a rare date night with my husband.  Still, we probably won't go back there, because of the food and also the price.  If they improve their food variety and quality, I will go back there again."
79,"SMOKE FILLED, SLOW AND EXPENSIVEHad heard about this place from a few people who raved about it. I know Japanese food (from Japan, so not the Americanized Japanese food) and the food is good. However, when three friends and I had dinner there tonight, the restaurant was literally FILLED with smoke from the brazier grills in the back. I mean, SERIOUSLY filled with smoke so much so that they opened the door behind the kitchen to help let the smoke out. We each ordered three dishes and the first two came in 20 minutes, followed by the next a full 60 minutes after we ordered, then the rest trickled in. The only dish they delivered in onder 10 minutes was a dessert. We left two hours later, $30 (before tip) less in our pockets, still hungry and smelling of a BBQ."
80,"First off, food was not that great, most of the food that we wanted to try was not available and our server didn't even offer to tell us what was available and what was not. Our server, Christian, was so inattentive and rude. Never once did he refilled our beverages and on top of that, he had the nerve to run after us after we paid the bill because it ""wasn't right and not enough"". We tipped 10% of our bill, which is very decent and generous for food and service that wasn't even that great. Never have I been so disrespected and talked down to that way, he didn't ask why his service could've been better, he just assumed he deserved to be tipped more. I will never come back and Christian deserves to be fired for the way he talks to customers that way."
81,"Came out with a friend cuz she wanted to try this place out. So disappointed. First off, this is supposed to be street food/pub grub, meaning cheap and fast. Not cheap and not fast, considering that you are eating chicken parts that no one else wants to eat, like hearts, gizzards, and skin. And it took awhile in between skewers. Tiny. Bite sized pieces. Ten minutes of waiting in betwwen. Gimme a break. Secondly, flavor was lacking in all the skewers. I thought they would use special marinade or something. Nope. Just smell and taste like they were grilled over a flame. Nothing special that I cant do at home on my own BBQ. Never tried their soba noodles, but judging by how expensive it was just to eat chicken parts, I really don't feel fired up to try their noodles boiled in water. The service was friendly though. Even when we had to wait an hour for a table since we didn't have a reservation, the host tried hard to accommodate us. Yep, an hour wait for chicken parts. Good service or not, I'm not going bakck."
82,"First off! the food that we ordered was mostly not available, the server did not told us that the food was not available until sometime later. We found other stuff on the menu but It is small portion, we enjoyed it. It was not the best thing ever but was pretty good, our server Christian was not attentive (drink was not refilled ect.) our bill end with around 120 my friend tipped 10% according to our experience. So Christian chased after us and said we only tipped 6% without asking how was the service and he was very rude. Will not come back I didn't paid it was my first time and it was bad for me."
83,"A summary of my dinner at Ippuku with my girlfriend:Arrive at restaurant at 7:45. Wait 52 minutes to be nonchalantly seated by usher that gave us a seat at the grill, when we purposely waited for a booth. Told the usher that we wanted to be seated at the booth, waited another 10 minutes for one.The food itself was okay, although portions were small. If you came looking to leave full, expect to spend around 80 - 90 dollars. The Japanese specialties they offered were okay, except i have to say their sea urchin is especially ""special."" The only thing worthwhile getting was the bacon wrapped mochi and the quail.Service was disapointing. Ambient environment, but ruined by the horrible service. Maybe it was just a bad day. Maybe, maybe not. Not recommending you try it and see."
84,"If you want to spend a lot of money on appetizers and then have to get dinner later, go to this place. True, I am not familiar with this kind of restaurant but nothing we ate was very flavorful and the portions are tiny and expensive. Left feeling ripped off and unsatisfied."
85,"I have never been to this restaurant, but my student ate the Chicken Tar Tar and got serious food poisoning - hospitalized for 4 days. Apparently she was not the only one who suffered food poisoning from the restaurant as well. Please research the facts before consuming any raw meat products."
86,"My entire experience could be summarized by the phrase ""A series of unfortunate events"". I initially had really high hopes for this restaurant but those aspirations slowly dwindled as the night progressed. The night started with having to wait 45 minutes for a table, which I guess was understandable, they were popular. In a way, this kind of raised my hopes even more if people were willing to wait so long to eat here, plus, the ambiance was really intriguing. When we were finally seated, the waiter tells us that they were out of the one dish I was eager to try. We proceeded to order 4 dishes, in 2 separate rounds. For the first round, the dishes came out pretty slow and were really small portioned but it was pretty good so somewhat permissible. However, the second round literally took a thousand years. Aside from taking forever for the dishes to come out, the 4th dish was never delivered. Since our waiter had never checked in on us, we asked about the progress of the dish and his exact words were ""It's almost here, I can see them plating it"". About 15-20 minutes later and still no food, the hostess comes by to tell us that they had run out of that dish. It was literally the biggest wtf moment ever. She proceeded to give us the bill and even forgot to take off the dish that we never got off the bill. Although they were very apologetic, there were many things that they could have done to redeem themselves but unfortunately, they completely missed those opportunities. That will probably be the first and last time I will dine here. Sorry guys."
87,"If inhaling grill smoke while eating overpriced and (deliberately?) undercooked skewers of chicken parts is your thing, you'll love this place.The booths looked cozy, but we didn't get one. I don't expect booth food is any better, though. Not a single one of our seven or eight small dishes was particularly memorable (in a good way), and I would have paid to not eat the undercooked chicken parts. The second star is because this place is so popular, and allegedly so authentic, I feel bad leaving just one."
88,"The place is original, some plates are really good (squid, ink fried rice...) some are just not as good as they are expensive. You may go once to try, and depending on what you tried, you may (or not) come again! There are so many good restaurants to test, I'm not sure I'll go back soon in this one. Let see..."
89,"I am not much of a meat eater anymore and the menu is totally lacking for vegetarian options. The few fish dishes they offer, I have tried and did not like very much. The food is salty and the portions are small. My girlfriend likes this place. She really enjoys the unusual meat selection which she finds similar to her region of China."
90,"We have been several times and have appreciated the carefully crafted food.  On this Friday night, however, the noise level was so high that it was hard to savor the food and conversation among the four of us was difficult.  It wasn't just the noise of cheerful people, but the music was loud.  When we asked the waitress about this, she said that the volume was cranked up on Friday nights.  Presumably, this is to make people eat more quickly and drink more.   The grace of Japanese dining was so diminished that we will not return soon."
91,"Eat with 2 friends. The waitress asked 3 of us (guys) to fit into a 2-person bench while there was another empty one next to it (-1 star). I ordered a whole squid, it was not fresh and there was no sauce (taseless, -1 star). The check had 17% tip, we sat at the counter there was no service beside from pouring water (-1 star). Overall, the food tasted bad comparing to similar places."
92,"The food tasted great at the time and dishes were very unique... until three people in our party got VIOLENTLY ILL FOR TWO WEEKS.  Maybe it was just bad luck with our rather adventurous order choices, but be forewarned."
93,"Food is standard izakaya but there aren't many in the area. Service is terrible, looked for someone to take our name down for a table but it took them 15 min. Waited more than an hour to get a table and then the rest of the experience was mediocre. They ran out of a bunch of items on the menu. Novelty restaurant if you haven't been to an izakaya before."
94,"Overrated, Overpriced, Horrible Service, Food Mediocre at best. Much better izakaya & yakitori restaurants in the SF Bay Area (such as Chotto, Kokko, Gochi, etc)"
95,"Not impressed, but it was $$$. I made reservations for three on a Wednesday night. We were looking forward to it since its had such great reviews. We arrived, there were several empty tables and we were seated near the door and kitchen, a little noisy, chilly and unaesthetic (view of machinery). the menu is odd things, didn't know any of it, which was fine. So we joked that one could probably just point to random things and be happily surprised. So we studied and referenced back and forth and finally ordered. The waitperson happily gave us a ""complimentary salad"" of a petite section of raw cabbage with the Japanese version of thousand island dressing. We ordered the tofu, recommended by the waitperson. Just, thinly sliced tofu abut 2/3 cup with a 1/4tsp of wasabi. I like tofu, a lot, and this was super bland tofu. We didn't finish it. Got the highly rated pork, small serving of course ($10). I took a bite and it was pure fat. Woops. ordered the grilled mackerel (loved that when I lived in Japan). Ive never seen such small mackerel. A bone got caught in my throat. I walked over to the waiter, slightly choking, and asked for some rice. he ran and got me a small bowl with about 2 T of (delicious) rice. Thanks. We got the grilled quail. Little baby quail. Chewy, whatever. We were still drinking sake, and one of the staff came to take our cup away because it was almost empty. ""wait, we're still drinking this."" But the kicker was, after ordering easily $100 in drinks and ""food"", the waiter told us we had been there for two hours and needed our table, could we please leave. My friend said to him while we were standing ready to depart that ""she has eaten out a lot, at many different restaurants, and has never been asked to leave."" He rescinded and invited us to sit down and he would bring us some water, and we were welcome to sit back down. No thanks. The spinach (1/2 cup, $5) was good. On the whole, Not recommended."
96,"Was excited to try this place out with all the great reviews, but was very disappointed.  Not sure if we caught them on an off night, but none of the dishes we ordered were all that great.  In fact, it was either kinda mediocre or so salty we couldn't get past it to taste anything else.  Here's what we ordered:* Agadishi Tofu - Mediocre and quite soggy.  Overpriced at $7 considering the quality of it.* Crab Croquette - Not that flavorful, but probably the best dish out of everything we had there* Pork Belly skewers - Tender & pretty tasty for the most part, but nothing out of the ordinary* Chicken Skin skewers - All I can say is, SALTY!!!* Chicken Ramen - Not bad, but again, very saltyAnyway, won't be coming back again and hope you all have a better experience there than we did."
97,"Stay away!Our office went here for a Friday evening ""debriefing"" on April 8th.  It was 10 of us in total.  7 of us ended up getting sick all with the same symptoms.  Of the 3 people who didn't, 2 didn't eat and the other didn't eat all of the items.2 people ended up going to their doctor and were diagnosed with campylobacteriosis.The food was good, but certainly not worth getting sick over."
98,"I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I liked the atmosphere. The food was bad, and the service was mediocre. After reading all of the glowing reviews, I have to say that I think a good experience here is probably mainly fueled by nostalgia for Japan, and not necessarily based on the actual food served. The sake was good, though.Our $55 meal started out with a hunk of cabbage and some bland sauce resembling mayonnaise as the house offering. Still hopeful, we ordered a variety of dishes. First came the potstickers, which were nicely displayed but uninteresting in flavor. It seemed like they needed a little kick of some ginger, or something vinegary to add zest. Just okay, nothing special. Next, the heirloom tomato arrived. It was under-ripe, and served simply sliced next to a pile of salt. Okay, I get the minimalist aesthetic, and I'm usually a fan - but only when the item being featured in such a naked fashion is really, really good. This tomato was mealy, partially green, and tasteless. After a few bites, we sent it back and ordered the ""avocado sashimi"" instead. Sadly, the avocado also arrived under-ripe (hard, in fact), and served with no embellishment other than a small pile of a moist salty substance.  Sheez. After that, we had yet another unremarkable dish consisting of ground chicken formed in the shape of a sausage. My partner remarked that it reminded him of some frozen chicken skewers he used to heat up in the microwave while in college. Edible, but nothing more than that. Next up, tuna sashimi mixed with some leafy green vegetable (possibly bok choy) and slathered in a slimy, tasteless sauce. The waiter had told it us that ""it tastes really good with sake."" After experiencing the unfortunate texture and (again) bland flavor, we understood what he meant, and quickly washed it down with a swig of sake. At that point, we just wanted to leave and go get a pizza around the corner at Jupiter. We canceled the rest of our order and left. To their credit, they brought the last dish and gave it to us on the house - shitake mushroom skewers again served with some moist salty substance. Though not intended to boot us out the door forever, it had that effect nonetheless.Wish we'd gone to Tokyo A-Go-Go instead. Or, anywhere else, really."
99,"I hate a restaurant that doesn't value customer service. I called twice trying to make a reservation but both times I was told they don't take reservations. Two days after the last call, hubby and I walk in early around 6pm. The hostess snootily denies our request to dine in because they require reservations. WTF. If she had simply apologized and taken a reservation for the next night, we'd have been happy and understanding. Instead she was rude and unwelcoming."
100,"Good:- Ambiance seems really authentic- Wait staff helpful/niceBad:- Food took way too long to come- Food portions tiny- FoodBasically, you should not go here expecting to come out satisfied unless you're willing to spend upwards of 40 dollars per per person (excluding drinks). We ordered two appetizers, one of which was bitter melon tempura (this was good, since it's deep fried). For the main course we took two omakases (chef's specialty - 5 pieces each) and one eggplant. The omakase consisted of 5 skewers, which looked presentable but was not fully cooked. The liver was quite raw, having the consistency of jell-o. We also ordered an eggplant, which was basically just... a small boiled eggplant. For some reason, this boiled eggplant took about 45 minutes to arrive.Maybe they were going for an authentic Japanese experience? But we left feeling really dissatisfied. The concept, ambiance, and wait staff are what save this place from a single star."
101,"I was very excited to come to this place. The decor is amazing and service was good. It fellt like we were in Japan and the charcoal grill smelled really good.When i opened the menu I noticed that the menu selection is very limited compare to other izzakaya or yakitori type of restaurants. We started with fried tofu and shochu, umeshu. Drinks are good but expensive. The friend tofu was also high priced so I expected it to be good, but it was really not that good. The taste was worse than a lot of lower end Japanese restaurants.Then came the skewers. A lot of them were overly burnt and salty. We also ordered the dashimaki egg. It was kind of watery and didn't tast good. We were glad that we didn't order that much. And we didn't consider adding anything else after we tasted some of them. But when the bill came it was still around $90 including tip for just 2 of us.Overall, we don't think we would ever come back here. I feel like we are paying for the decor instead of the food. And for us to go there to just enjoy the atmosphere, the food at least need to be OK not bad.I really hope they can consider improving the food quality and not waste such a nicely decored place."
102,"I was super excited to try this izakaya (small Japanese dish) restaurant especially with all the rave reviews.  But I'd have to say I was disappointed.  Every dish we had here was a little...off in flavor.  I thought it was just me and was quiet about it throughout the dinner, but when I expressed my opinions after I left, everyone in the party that I ate with thought so too.  It's not like we rarely eat Japanese cuisine either. Maybe it was an off night for them?  Maybe we ordered the wrong things?  We ordered a bunch of dishes including fish, soup, beef, veggies, tofu.  Sadly, what I liked the most was the gyoza and the tea. And it was a pricey dinner.  Parking was a little difficult to find around this area as well.  My favorite part was the ambience that makes you feel like you're in Japan.  There are traditional curtains at the entrance and you remove your shoes.  Not sure I would come back here as food was just eh."
103,"Overpriced, small portions, took me three hours to get a few dishes. Horrible seating, too hot, cramped. I am not a picky eater at all, and to be honest, the food itself wasnt even good. I got some real food after I left, for a third the price. If you like spending $5 on small corn, then this is the place for you. Honestly, I got the impression that this place is not a place where people go to eat good food. It is a place where people go to spend  money unnecessarily large amounts of money, because they can, to be seen - in essence it is place for people to showoff and feel superior. Sorry if that is a little harsh, but that is certainly the impression I got. On the bright side,  the staff was pretty attentive, although slow."
104,"We went to this place last night and were excited that it was open till 11 pm as we always get started late. We walked in at 9:15ish and were told that they were out of food, this isn't about being so popular that you ran out 2 hours early on a Saturday night. This reeks of really poor management, continued blunders like this means they won't be there for very long in my estimation."
105,"Not a good experience. The gyoza were soggy, the okra was raw, the mackerel was rubbery, and they were out of the chicken skin skewer. The liver skewer was just okay. The ramen smelled like Campbell's chicken noodle and was swimming in chicken fat, one bite and I had grease all over my lips, gross. The dishes came out one at a time over about 45 minutes, just plopped on the table by various waitstaff.  We asked for the rice so we could eat it with the mackerel but the waiter informed us that the kitchen serves the starches at the end of the meal. Huh? I returned the ramen to the kitchen. No apology, not a word, from anyone, as if having food sent back was such a common occurrence that it didn't deserve comment. In fact, the waiter never informed me whether they were going to bring out another ramen and didn't even ask me if I wanted something else. When I finally flagged him down, all he said was, ""Oh, I didn't know you wanted to order a replacement,"" as if I had ordered the ramen for fun and not because I was hungry. Ippuku came recommended, but the quality is obviously inconsistent. When I go out to eat, I like to know that I will leave satiated and satisfied, and not hungry, aggravated, and still $40+ (for two) poorer."
106,"I was insanely excited to eat here after hearing all of the hype within the industry. Tonight they seemed to be out of at least one of every 3 things we tried to order (by 8pm on a Wednesday, including staple drink items), service was poor (although friendly), and the food was overall pretty...meh. I read the professional reviews about the service, so when the first few hiccups came, the inexplicable bowl of cabbage with mayo arrived, the warm towels that I had to hand to the busser after having them on the table for close to 20 minutes after we used them, the numerous empty plates that began to pile up, having to flag down a server for water and drinks...the more that I think about it the angrier I'm getting. Nombe (which has shit for an interior, but a killer menu and sakes) is worth infinitely more hype. As an industry veteran, I can't believe that nothing has been done to address the obvious issues that have made it into numerous reviews by ownership and management. Thankfully the company at our table made the night pleasurable, and insured a memorable celebration."
107,Not sure how this place is so popular. Mediocre taste and very pricey. Ramen was less interesting than store bought. Cool decor tho.
108,"only get 2 stars cause the place itself is so cool. staff was nice as well. food, however, is just awful. had grilled prok belly and it was all fat + tough, two orders. lots of things cold. too bad, wanted to love the place, won't go back."
