0,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
1,Cakes 4 starsServices 0 star.I went here to get my husband's birthday cake but my husband and I were totally unhappy with their service. I just don't know why they were so upset.No smiles. No greetings.Cake isn't too bad though but we won't be back.
2,"Cakes = 4.5 stars. Service = -3.5. Net = 1 star.Really? How complacent could you get that it takes 30 minutes to move a line of 3 people? I saw the person (owner?) taking the order was multitasking so much that it took him literally 15 min just to slice a piece of cake & he seemed to be having sadistic pleasure while looking at those waiting. This is after making the order...after standing in line for several minutes. So you can't even turn back.And running out of most everything at 1pm?A slice of cake (a sliver of cake to be precise) for $6?And that blond female store clerk with the poker face who looks like she would die on the spot if she smiles? No matter how good you bake, things are going downhill if you continue this stinking' bad service and act like CAKE NAZI."
3,"I would give them NEGATIVE stars for their service, ONE star for their cafe, and FIVE stars for their cakes. First the good news: their tea, cakes and rugelach are OUTSTANDING-- nobody does it better in the Bay Area.  I have ordered multiple cakes from them and they are all fabulously rich, authentic, and made to order.  If they have any rugelach in the afternoon, it's perfect, though the size varies considerably and is a little on the small side for the price.  However, from my first encounter with the staff a year ago, I have only witnessed rudeness, indifference or actual disdain for customers.  It doesn't matter who you are, how much you are spending, or whether you ordered in advance: the staff of this bakery seems to hate its customers. Why are they hired in a service capacity? Is the owner similarly nasty? Today was the worst yet.  It took me about 25 minutes to drive over and arrived around 2:30 pm.  I had to finish a phone call so sat in front, knowing that their hours (posted online and on the door in front of me) indicated that they closed at 4 on Saturdays.  However, sometime between the time I parked and when I got to their door, they added a sign that said ""Closing today at 3:30"".  When I entered at 2:50 pm, the ENTIRE shop was already wiped clean, all shelves empty, NADA for sale anywhere.  I asked the sullen face behind the counter ""There is nothing here?""She said ""No. We're all sold out.  It's Saturday. It's always like this.""Hmm.  I understand that they are closed on Sunday, but really?  They can't or don't make enough to have a few cookies for sale in the afternoons before a day off? The counter person did not apologize.  There was no ""Sorry"" or ""but we could make you a cup of coffee or tea still?""  No.  It appeared that the she and the people behind the counter resented anyone who had stepped into this shell of a bakery.  I walked out, and then remembered how strange it was to see other workers on weekdays sweep angrily around the tables when they're occupied and people are still eating or sipping their tea when there is still at least one more open hour.On the other hand, if you don't expect a normal relaxed and inviting atmosphere, or basically ANY kindness or warmth from the humanoids behind the counter, AND you come early in the day, maybe you'll get there when there is  still something to purchase in one of the cases.  Then you'll get a taste of some of the best cakes outside of Prague, Vienna or Bucharest."
4,"Wow. The waitresses here act like you owe them money. Hey, I already paid for my cake ok? You can smile..."
5,"I came here few days ago to buy cakes but the service was poor. No greetings, no smile, no thankyou. Wont come back here again."
6,"Im here at 3:55 and its fully closed.  Annoying to say the least.  It's ok though, the owner looks like he gives zero phux"
7,Secret frequent buyer reward system! Only learned about it because a regular in line in front of me claimed a reward. They said it's new when I asked about it. But I was in yesterday and could have gotten credit for that purchase if I had known. Great food but this is really crappy.
8,"I have to agree with the other Yelp reviewers who found the staff cold and rude.  My friend and I stopped in for coffee and dessert on a cold, rainy day, and sadly found the mood inside matched the weather outside.  The desserts we got were OK, but not remarkable in any way.  Perhaps we visited them on a bad day, but the reviews mentioning unfriendly service are spot on."
9,"RAGE. I feel utter rage. They literally sold me HALF a cake. Literally. For my bro's 16th birthday, I ordered their flourless chocolate cake. It's gonna be a small party so I get the smallest size. The lady on the phone says, ""oh it's gonna be half the sheet"". Ok, that's fine. Or so I thought. Actually this is a cake with raised sides. And when they cut that cake in half, they don't add a fourth raised side. WHAT?!?!! It's literally HALF a cake!!!!!!!!You can imagine my face when I go and pick up the cake and they present me with the half cake. And you know what the girl says? She says: you know, I often feel like people put too much focus on the look. YOU DON'T SAY?!!!??  I paid you $30 for a teeny tiny cake and you don't think the presentation is important???!!!RAGE. I can't give my bro a half cake for his birthday so I had to pay another $30 for a small WHOLE cake. That is the last $60 I will spend at this bakery again. Makes me so sad. They really are very good at making cakes. But so utterly terrible at taking care of their customer.(And to add salt to the injury, I paid them $5 to inscribe ""16!!!"" On the half cake. $1 a character!!!!)"
10,Wanted to like this place.  Rude and aloof staff made me feel uncomfortable.  Just walked out.
11,"Their pastries and cakes are usually tasty enough but I can't get over their consistently rude service. With so many talented bakeries in our area, I'll go somewhere else. It's rare to be welcomed into the store or to get a thank you upon leaving. If you ask about their selections, your response will probably be prefaced by a sigh and a rolling of the eyes. I have stopped in at Crixa intermittently since they opened as my mom's house is nearby and I've always felt negative about their customer service. I'll save my money a friendly, happy store like Sweet Adeline's."
12,I do not recommend this place. Below are my reasons why NOT:1. Service- HORRIBLE! The girls who work there are horrible. Bad attitudes! 2. CAKE-  I ordered the AMARETTI CREAM CAKE for my husband's bday- the frosting made us sick! The cake was bland. Nothing special at all Don't go here! Bundt cakes in Emeryville is WAY BETTER!
13,They have good cakes - hands down delicious. Their coffee drinks are very tasty too. I stopped going because the service and interaction with the staff is absolutely horrible. I can speak from multiple occasions now that every time I left the store I felt I paid way too much money and was treated very unfriendly almost rude. I agree with other reviewers - they are overpriced and I rather bring my business someplace else where I am treated nicely as a customer.
14,"I used to live in close proximity to this bakery and I was drawn to it based on the unique selection they offered and the fact that their website lists all the menu items sold that particular day (I would decide to swing by based on the daily menu). While a few of their items were undeniably delicious, Crixa Cakes is lackluster even though they have a story behind the store name, stories of cake descriptions, and a cool rabbit trademark to go along with it.Standout items (+):1) Walnut Slice - my absolute favorite in this bakery. People wax on and on about Fatima's Thighs and Florios, but this is the best flaky pastry in the house. It comes with these plump, juicy golden raisins and walnuts flavored with vanilla and lemon. It is a little reminiscent of a walnut baklava but better!2) Poppyseed rugelach - rugelach can easily get a little dry, but this one was buttery, flaky, and the honey gave it flavor. The other plethora of treats I've tried were not as mindblowing. Cakes - really fresh with a spongy consistency, but lack flavor. All their cream is  tasteless albeit whipped nicely.  This is A-OK for light cakes like the amaretti cream cake but doesn't work at all for their black forest cake. Even their pave and bourbon cake don't have that rich chocolate flavor. Their individual cakes, on the other hand, like the Carmella and the Boston Cream Pie taste very heavy. The fact that the cream is a lotta fluff and no stuff is a qualm I have across the board with their other items as well. Their version of St. Honore Cake, which I was excited to try had an overly saturated sweet coating and was woefully small in size. The ""Kremes"" or napoleon looked fluffy but instead of layers of pastry and cream, you get one HUGE rectangle of cream sandwiched between two thin wafers. There's also a great size discrepancy between each napoleon. Same goes for their bread pudding.Some of their workers are friendly; some are grouches. I've always had trouble with their customer service when pre-ordering a cake to have it inscribed. Not the most helpful. Overall, I feel most their products are not worth the price, and I haven't even bought their $5 seasonal cookies before."
15,"I tried three items, all of which were meh:The pumpkin pie was very mushy, almost to the point of being a puree.  And the flavor was bland: yelp.com/user_local_phot…Not nearly as good as Beckmann's version.The chocolate bourbon cake had zero bourbon flavor to it, and the texture was a very dense one-note for both the cake and frosting: yelp.com/user_local_phot…The amaretti cream cake was very light, but it lacked flavor: yelp.com/user_local_phot…"
16,"What happened Crixa Cakes? I've had the bread pudding here many times over the years but yesterday, the cake was awful!!  First of all, it was overly drenched with custard sauce and the cake was complete mush.  In the past, the cake actually tasted like cake and not like baby food.  The aggressive soak of custard actually ruined the flavor and all I could taste was sugar.  Also, the person in charge of slicing the cakes cut the cake up in different sizes.  I bought two slices (both about 4.65 each) but one slice was about half the size of the other slice. The peach/raspberry pie was good.I noticed new faces in the bakery.  Quality control needs to be increased.  Mushy disproportionally sized slices of cake is not going to cut it for me especially not at these prices."
17,"Cakes were good a bit on the sweeter side. What I didn't like about this place are the workers. They are unfriendly, not smiley and made us felt unwelcome. We had order a few different items for 4 different people so we ask to have our goodies packed separately. They reluctantly packed it separately and repeatedly ask us if we are sure we want it packed separately in a rude voice as if it was a huge hassle. Why so upset with packing it separately? If we bought our goodies separately they would have to pack them individually anyways. That was such a turn off. I will not return to this bakery."
18,"Well, I am going to rain on this 4+* parade. Went there for the second time today (around 1pm) because I think they make decent cappuccinos and their baked good are delicious.When we (wife & I) arrived, there were 4 people behind the counter. One woman at the register taking an order for a custom birthday cake (I.e special greeting, etc.) with a customer, one person washing dishes and two other people literally standing around looking bored. Neither of the two available people made an effort to acknowledge our entrance and just stood there doing nothing.I finally asked one of them if I could order. I was told NO, I had to do that at the register. (which, if you haven't been there is all of 2 feet away).  I waited another few minutes and asked again. Again I was told NO, all orders had to be placed at the register. I pointed out that the only person working the register was taking an apparently complex order. At that point the woman at the register turned towards me and sternly told me that was the way they ran the business and I would just have to wait.Well, they are entitled to run their business as they please, and I an equally entitled to go elsewhere, which I immediately did. As we left I glanced at the two, apparently useless, employees and they were still standing there staring blankly out the window.C'mon, you can do better than that. Even if you don't give a damn about me, you don't have to be so blatant about it.BTW, note thie scores are trending way down for the past 2 months. Maybe something happened?"
19,If Yelp had a 0-star rating I would select that option but since 1 is the lowest it goes here's your 1 star. Super rude staff. I tried to order on the phone and I understand that they can get busy but did not want to help me in the least bit.Never ordering from you guys again.
20,"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer.They exude ""snuttiness""! ( I had to invent a word to describe this place.) I think this starts with the management/the owner and it trickles down to the cashier. I was going to say to the busboy, but I have not seen a busboy at Crixa, so I don't know if they have one. When I ate there, I had to bus my own table.Yes, they do have some home-made pastry to die for, I am a sucker for East European pastry, but what good is that if you can't ever get them?So many times I have gone after work to buy some pastry for the weekend and they had ran out of everything - I would see empty shelves and they'd try to sell me a dry macaroon cookie for twice the price you can buy the same one everywhere else. On top if that, the ATTITUDE you'll get it will infuriate you. Oh, and try to order something in advance - fat chance. I wanted to order a birthday cake for my husband, it was such a hustle, and they had so many restrictions, that I just gave up. I come from Eastern Europe, this is NOT and East European behavior, it is a unique Crixa Cakes ""snuttiness""."
21,"Wasted an entire afternoon driving to this place to get an item that I was told would be here. Showed up and was told I was ""misinformed."""
22,"This is an update of my original review on Yelp about my nasty experience with Crixa cake in Berkeley ca. This is in response to the reply that Zoltan Crixa cake front manager gave to my original review to set the story straight.Zolton's reply to my review added insult to injury. You were right in that when I ordered your cake, Kate the lady who took my order never informed me of Crixa's cancellation policy.  I am glad that you see right to give me a refund.However, I wish to refute the statement that I threatened your employee. In no way did I do that. All I said to her is that if she continue to refuse to let me speak to the owner or the manager of the shop I shall have no choice but to go to YELP and tell my story so that Crixa Cake shop owner/manager would get a feedback from me. That is not a threat but a factual statement of how I shall proceed with the matter at hand, if I am not allowed to speak to the owner or manager. Zoltan, it is a shame that after being gentleman enough to refund me the money I paid because your employee did not make clear to me your policy, you have come down to a level of ""what your employee said"", and  ""what the customer said"".  It makes your decision to refund my money SEEMED SO BOORISH after all and leave a sour taste in one's system."
23,"Watch them pack your order, make sure there is a receipt for what you ordered and then keep your receipt until you have opened your box at home and are sure you have what you ordered!  Crixa has a cashier that takes orders but another worker actually packs the boxes so mistakes can happen.Yesterday I ordered a dessert that the cashier was unaware was sold out.  She rang me up before she realized her mistake.  She got her manager to clear the transaction.  I substituted another order for the sold out item, she refunded the difference and told me she could put both of my items in the same box if that was OK w/ me.  Big mistake as only 1 of my 2 items was in the box.  And unlike prior orders to go there was no receipt taped to the box listing the contents.  When I opened the box at home only 1 of my 2 orders were in the box.  I returned today, explained to the cashier that only 1 of my 2 orders were packed for me, but she refused to give me my missing vanilla meringue (not a big ticket item)!!!  Her reasoning was that I did not have a receipt, but when I explained I never got one from her she still refused to give me my missing meringue.4 stars for quality of desserts, 0 stars for customer service equals a 2 star rating from me."
24,"I just had this conversation with Crixa staff on the phone. I was attempting to order a cake for this weekend, within their 3 day advance notice requirement. Me: Hi. I am calling to make to order a cake for this weekend.Crixa: Yes ma'am. When do you need the cake by?Me: Saturday.Crixa: Ok. What kind of cake would you want to order?Me: A Black Forest Cake.Crixa: I'm sorry, you can't order that cake. Me: Um, what? I can't order that cake?Crixa: Yes ma'am you can't order that cake on Saturday. Me: Can I order another cake? Crixa: No.Me: Are you saying I can't order ANY cake for Saturday? Crixa: No. Followed by about 5 seconds of silence. Me: How about Friday?Crixa: No. Me: I can't order any cake for either Friday or Saturday?Crixa: No.Me: Never mind. LOL. Is it too much to ask that people communicate properly? How difficult would it have been to say ""we're completely booked and are no longer accepting advance orders""?"
25,Bread pudding and apple pieWas expecting so much from them but both desserts were too bready just not delicious at allAverage $5 per dessert
26,"I have to hand it to them. Not only is the service still bad, I think it's even worse. The woman at the counter couldn't seem to figure out how to get two orders going at the same time (mine just a coffee drink and the other, some people who were taking years to decide.)  And I'm sorry, I lived in Hungary for two years spending the better part of my days in a cukrazda and didn't see any of that stuff on the menu. WOWZA."
27,"I don't care how amazing your product is, when you are running a business, you can't treat your customers like dirt. Asking a baker, ""What's the freshest cake you have right now?"" should elicit a response like, ""Well, this ginger cake just came out of the oven two hours ago, and it's delicious."" You'll sell a piece of ginger cake and make a customer happy.How does the guy at Crixa respond to that question? ""That's really not an appropriate question, all of our cakes are fresh."" OK, I get that. Everything is fresh. But it's certainly not an inappropriate question. You bake cakes, I buy slices to enjoy. I'm asking you for advice about which I should buy from you. So I try to clarify...""I'm just trying to decide which to get, which is the most fresh.""The guy responds, ""I don't have to answer that question. I'm not going to answer it."" Much to the embarrassment of other patrons who are trying to enjoy their cakes. Congratulations. You've just lost a customer. Running a business is not just about making a quality product."
28,"Oh Crixa, I wanted to fall so deeply in love with you that I'd run to you during a PMS binge. But, the peeps working here acted like I was a homeless person coming in to ask for a fuckin sample with the snooty tude I got.It wasn't till I actually paid that I saw a slight warmth in the tude. I really don't  need that shit from anyone and I won't be back again to put up with your bullshit Crixa folks.. ya'll need to lighten up a lil..you're in Berkeley for cryin out loud, you're not feeding the Queen, get over yourselves!It doesn't help that one of my super homeys is a pastry chef and serves up some of the tastiest pastries I've ever had in my life. So, it was no wonder I wasn't blown away by your apple cake. Let me tell ya, I don't usually boast about my baking talents..but, really..I could make that cake..and I shall..and I'll leave out the nuts because they weren't really needed.The Boston Cream Pies and those coffee puff things I got were tasty and all, but I've had better, I really have.I actually feel bad that I was so disappointed in my experience here after some of my good friends with good taste have put Crixa cakes up on such a pedestal. Well, you just got knocked down a peg and I'm pretty unforgiving so, that's where you'll stay.Crixa can suck my dixa!"
29,"well very hard to find a good bakery in east bay.. So considering this situation, Crixa can be one of the stop-by but... I wish I can feel more happier when speaking to the workers there.. they need to improve the attitude."
30,i bought a small espresso tiramisu cake. It tasted good but after a few slices the cake started to sink...hmm
31,This is your typical useless cafe. The occupants are the nearly dead or barely employed. They pile their crap on the tables and chairs so anyone arriving is unlikely to find a place to sit. I spotted fully half of the people banging away on their crApple products sans food and/or drink.The staff is either incompetently obsequious or incompetently indifferent. The sneer to tattoo ratio has a positive relationship. The hipster motif does little to distract from the lack of seating.And the food? The nearly $5 slice of cake was not worth the cost based on portion size or quality. The latte I  was delivered with the opposite grace and customer service was indistinguishable from those I've been served at Starbucks.
32,"Love their ginger cake, but their attitude keeps me away. I literally live a block away from Crixa, but I can count on 1(one) hand the number of times I've patronized them since they opened. My neighbors have actually berated me for spending money there. Really. The pasty older fellow (owner?) should stay out of the customer service end of things. If Ben Stein & an angry, encased-in-carbonite ferret had a love child, this guy would be the progeny. He has a foul demeanor, deliberately  & inexorably moves in slow motion, and seems to frighten his staff. Who, I might add, are often as useless as t*ts on a boar (perhaps he has them so terrified they're afraid to do anything, lest they be snarled at).Two stars for the ginger cake; negative to the 3rd power rating for the service."
33,"Boo...Really disappointed especially after reading all the great reviews..I went in on a weekday afternoon, got the raspberry almond cake and hippie cake.The raspberry almond cake was dry, the hippie cake was a tad bit more moist but really nothing specially, especially considering the $8 bill that came along with it."
34,"The pastries here are pretty good, but the curmudgeonly owner ruins the entire experience.  He terrifies his staff and repeatedly treats his customers rudely.If you come here when he's behind the counter, do yourself a favor and walk out.  Otherwise, you will wait forever for a single pastry (even if there is no line) simply because he hates his job and doesn't feel like serving you.  Then, when you ask one of his baristas to simply hand you the pastry that is within arms reach of her, he will give you your money back and tell you to be on your way.  Such was my experience several weeks ago.What a way to alienate a loyal customer base."
35,"Update (4/17):HAIR FOUND IN CAKE!! What the nasty!Bought a tiramisu cake. While enjoying the cake, all of a sudden my friend gets up to throw her piece of cake away. Why would she do that to such a tastey cake? Well because a hair was baked in it. Not a plesant thing to experience when celebrating a friends birthday and another friend finds a piece of hair in the cake that YOU bought. How embarrassing. I was going to call them to ask for another cake, but then the moment has gone and no need for another cake now.-------The place is cute and seems like the perfect place to be on a sunny morning. Their items are a bit on the pricer side compared to other bakeries in the area, but I guess their selection has a better range. More cakes than anything else really.They have seasonal items too. A lot of people end up ordering a pot of tea and a slice of cake. Their small cakes sell for about 24 dollars which is a bit pricey since it's so tiny but it is delicious and not overly sweet which gives them my respect. Mmm chocolate orange mousse cake.I thought the guy who took my order was a bit scary. You know the type that has the perfect up right posture and is so friendly and proper that it's borderline creepy? Yea...that vibe, but the quaintness of the place took that momentary darkness away. Trying to cut back on sweets might be a bit difficult after finding this place. I'm already eager to come back to drink a pot of tea and eat me a slice of cake. Dang I'm such a sugar whore."
36,"Verbatim, here is my experience from last Friday afternoon:Me: Hi, is it too late to buy a birthday cake for Sunday?Girl: Oh, we're not open Sunday so you'd have to pick it up tomorrow.Me: Oh that's no problem. I'd like to order a Carrot Cake.Girl: It's too late to order a carrot cake. You can order uh, one of these cakes (points to the case).Me: Okay, that's fine. I need something kid-friendly, not chocolate but anything else is fine.Girl: You will have to buy one of the ones we have here though because it's too late to order one.Me: Wait. Didn't I just ask you that? Okay. I can take one of these... but you only have chocolate.Girl: There's this strawberry cream cake.Me: But it's missing a few slices... it's for a birthday party.Girl: Oh right. Well you can order a flourless chocolate cake.Me: (aside) are you effing kidding me? Girl: Well, also, you can come by tomorrow and see what we made to put out in the case and you can buy one of those cakes before we put them in the cafe.Me: Oh I guess that's fine but since it's almost closing time, can I just prepay for one of them and come first thing? I just want to make sure I get a cake for my son's party.Girl: No, sorry. I can't do that.Me: Why not?Girl: Because he (gestures to the man baking behind her) doesn't like me to ask questions.Great cake, great service just down the block at Sweet Adelines. Who's on Third Crixa Cakes?"
37,"Based on Yelp reviews, I was excited to give this place a try.  I was expecting to be knocked out by unbelievable cake. Instead, I was sadly disappointed by lackluster customer service (including annoyed looks from the 2 folks behind the counter when my partner and I were deliberating about what to get) and overly heavy old-world European-style cake.  It was fresh and decent, but certainly nothing to write home about.  I was also surprised that my strawberry cream cake was not advertised as a rum cake, despite being soaked in rum.  As someone who's circle of close friends includes many folks in recovery, these kinds of things are important to know, and I expect more attention to those details in my local establishments."
38,"Rude, mean owner makes me not care how good the cakes are.  I could not believe how mean he was to my friend.  Never going again."
39,They serve coffee and pastries but don't open until 9:00. Sweet Adeline's for me then.
40,"Crixa makes lovely bread pudding and an awesome coconut cream pie.  Get your order to go and leave it at that if you must.But I have to tell ya, the people who work there seem to be the most unpleasant and unhappy people known to man.  Took someone there today with tales of delicious-ness.  He (and I) were stunned by the snarky girl behind the counter.  Sorry if we bothered you with our order!I had a blind date there once; we bonded over our mutual astonishment over the crappy customer service.  I give up.  I'll miss the pies and cakes, but hey, I don't need to pay to be abused, people!!"
41,This bakery is THE MOST OVERRATED bakery!I know It's good but it's wayyy to expensive!!! Stay away from this place....The  bun costs $2.50 which is crazy!.The owner is super greedy!!!! The place is small and  tiny...
42,"Crixa Cakes pastries are quite good. Unfortunately, they come with a side of rude service that shows no focus on the customer. When asked to set aside the last Boston Cream Pie because it's my 3 year old's birthday and his favorite dessert, I was instructed - with no kindness - that I should have ordered 4 pieces 3 days before. You'd be better served by taking your patronage and your money to Masse's."
43,"Very disappointed in their service! BEWARE . . .  What you see (in way of desserts) is not what you get! Even though the desserts are expensive, the peach berry pie looked delicious and we decided to go for it. Not only was the crust tasteless, the filling was over-sweet to the point that we couldn't even eat it. I informed the two owners that I was not happy and could I get something else instead? One told me 'the rules,' that if someone doesn't like their order, they won't replace it but if there is something wrong with it, they might. I said there was something wrong, too much sugar. So, I asked the other (male) owner who was totally rude to me and before I even asked he said, no, he would not replace it, with a big attitude. I mean what is the cost of a replacement dessert to make a customer happy? My husband and I will never go there again and I will tell my friends of my bad experience. I guess they just want the money and don't care about their customer's satisfaction. Not good business practice."
44,"Went in today to order a birthday cake and was met with terrible customer service from an older white man with an attitude, who told me he thought I'd be happier at another bakery.  So I went to Masse Bakery in Berkeley instead and I am!"
45,"This review is for customer service only- based upon that, I won't be bothering to stop by.  Recent phone conversation:Me: Hi, I'm searching for a carrot cake. Do you make them there?Crixa Guy (CG): We don't have that on our current menu.Me: So could I special-order one?CG: That's not on our current menu. I can make you an apple cake.Me: No, really, you're not answering my question. IS IT AT ALL POSSIBLE TO GET A CARROT CAKE FROM YOU AT ANY POINT IN TIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE?CG: No.::click::Thanks, guys. And your little dog, too."
46,"Don't do cakes so this is about pastries.Bland, uninteresting, and not so special describes my experience with the pastries.  For example, the shortbread cookies were somewhat hard and not very buttery and not cheap either.I'm not sure what the excitement is about, perhaps Berkeley doesn't have many bakeries.  I went here based on the yelpers' reviews.  Not again."
47,"I think Crixa is overrated!  We were expecting something like the extraordinary desserts in San Diego because the pricings are similar - high price.  The cake was dry, the flavoring was off.  We went there a couple of weeks ago and I can't remember anything good about the two pieces of desserts we got.  I would not go back and I certainly do not recommend this place."
48,"Very small place, over priced bakery goods.. customer service was sub parr!  Would not visit this place again.  Cashier and staff didnt seem very inviting..."
49,"I had  amazing hopes for this place and got a purple pie(plum and berries).  It was a rustic pie with  a pretty good crust, but the filling was so sweet I scraped off most of it.  I don't know how their other items are, but they really need to work on balance of flavors and the amount of sugar they use."
50,"I was totally craving something sweet and yummy earlier this afternoon and remembered driving by Crixa a few times before.  So on my way home, I was hungry and desperate enough to stop by this little bake store, hoping that my craving would be satisfied.I ordered a nearly $5 slice of tiramisu to-go, which looked really good...jumped back in my car, and had forkfuls of it while I was stopped at the red lights.  You would think that being as starved as I was, anything that I put in my mouth would be 10 times more delicious than it actual is...but unfortunately, the tiramisu seriously disappointed me.  I was not at all impressed.  I've definitely had better.P.S. The service here really does suck...there were probably 4 people working behind the counter, and not a single one of them looked happy...you would think that being around all this supposed ""yumminess"" would give you a natural high, but the cashier woman was sort of rude...i don't know...maybe I just happened to go on a bad day.  But people, cheer up please!"
51,"I ""have"" been a fan of Crixa Cakes.  But as good as their bakery is, success has spoiled this place.  I would give them an award for the most arrogant bakery in the Bay Area.  They run out of a lot of things, so when I make a special trip to Crixa Cakes, I always call and pre-order.  Well, now they won't take a pre-order for small things (like pieces of their cakes or pastries) and you HAVE to call 2 days in advance.  I tried to reserve quite a few things - a good sized order that MOST bakeries would be happy to fill.  But they weren't willing to take any orders for less than a half sheet of cake!  So you just have to take your chance, drive there, and HOPE that they have what you want?!  No, I'll give my business in the future to La Farina or some of the other wonderful bakeries in Oakland and Berkeley who appreciate customers.  If more customers did this, maybe Crixa Cakes would remember who made them successful - CUSTOMERS!"
52,"I haven't eaten anything from this bakery, so I can't offer an opinion on the food. The shop is small and charming, if  a tad over done. The food is overpriced, way overpriced. I will never purchase anything from this bakery. I had an interview there and was incredibly turned off by their attitude. I have since then know two other bakers that had equally unpleasant interviews at this place. I was five minutes late due to getting lost (I'm not from Berkeley and got a tad turned around). When I got there I was made to sit and wait twenty minutes! before the woman came out to tell me that they were on too tight of a schedule to allow for the error of starting my interview late and that they would have to discuss whether or not they would consider rescheduling my interview. Um, would it have really thrown off the balance of their universe to start just a few minutes late? If life at Crixa is that strict, then it is so not worth the fifteen buck an hour they offer."
53,i was craving an awesome desert and decided to check out a good place on yelp. we tried 3 different deserts. and they were if anything average.  very disappointing because the reviews rated their deserts highly. so i went to bakesale bettys afterwards to satisfy my sweet tooth which it did very well. maybe i am just very hard to please but everyones entitled to their own opinion.
