0,"Regardless of the over hour long wait, and the half hour wait for my food from when I ordered, this place is overrated. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the brioche French toast and the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. The brioche French toast was okay, but definitely something you could make at home; the only redeeming factor to it was the lavender honey syrup that was on it. As for the pancakes, they did not taste like oatmeal or raspberry and for some reason they were blue (like they used blueberries instead.) Overall the pancakes were bland and the only thing that saved them was the raspberry blueberry compote (that you have to pay $2.75 extra for.)This place is definitely not worth the wait, but even with no wait, I would not recommend this place unless you like basic bland foods."
1,"2 stars is harsh, I know, but the only redeeming quality for me was our great waitress.Everyone knows the wait here is excessive but I inaccurately remembered it to be much more worth it. We were seated outside next to a broken heat lamp in the shade and it was SO cold. When I used the restroom, there was a lot of seating indoors so I have no clue why we couldn't just sit there instead.I ordered Les Oeufs Lucas and it was a blob of watery egg scramble and too many tomatoes. I was not impressed at all and wondered why I thought of La Note fondly in the past. Overrated and overhyped. Next time, I'll stick with Venus."
2,"Worst possible hosts ever. Show up and they tell you 45 minutes. 45 minutes later and they tell you 45 more minutes. This is the second Sunday in a row this is happened. Management - - you got to get a hold of these workers and tell them how to do their job. Also their demeanor is not pleasant in any way. Not professional. I was hoping that after the last time these two ladies would've gotten their act together but they haven't. Also the fact that it takes two of them just to manage this crowd!Apparently a new rule at this restaurant is no substitutions. I have always subbed out toast and instead gotten two slices of cinnamon brioche, even a month ago. No more. Why? I used to get two slices of the brioche instead of the four slices of toast, and that was perfect. I don't care if the waitresses knew, she needs to at least find out about what I am saying has been done in the past. Unless they have changed the rules.As most other reviews state, all the food is exceptionally good."
3,"Its been a while since last time, so bad slow service with bad White staffs. drinks menu comes from the bar, so lazy without guidance. The hostess don't know what to do with incoming flocks of ppl. bad floor management. please, get better. I would love to support local services with history. but this is so unbearable for the price."
4,"I'm baffled by these reviews. Yet another example of an overhyped, overpriced badly run business. There is nothing at La Note that is halfway decent - not the food, not the service, not the ambiance. My friend recommended this to me, so I took my brother here who was visiting, and I feel embarrassed that I took him here and really regretted. it. Not sure why they claim to be French, I just got back from France, and anyone who's been to a decent French restaurant even in the states know that this is at best an American restaurant with a menu written in French. Let's start with food, since this is a restaurant. My brother ordered the poulet grille (grilled chicken sandwich), and it was not only totally flavor-less and dull, it was also undercooked. Absolutely disgusting. It came with potatoes and my brother asked our waiter for ketchup when he ordered. The ketchup was not brought with food. We asked again for it, and I guess the waiter *forgot* again. Although it was apparent that he was busy laughing and fooling around with the others. Finally, we asked another waiter who brought it out in a few minutes. Upon eating the potatoes we realized we might might as well have not gotten the ketchup since they were garbage. Not only were they not seasoned right, but worst yet THEY WERE BURNT. I ordered the les oeufs lucas, once again a total waste. It simply wasn't tasty, here is no other way to put it. I don't think the tomatoes that were served with it were fresh, because they tasted like they'd been hanging out in the fridge for about a week. I also specifically told them to cook the eggs well, but they were really runny. I would've assumed I'd gotten the wrong dish, if it weren't for my brother's tasteless undercooked chicken. The ambiance is also really loud, and this was a weekday in the early afternoon! It was difficult to have conversation. But this is my favorite part - my brother was showing me a snapchat on his phone and the host (I think? or maybe manager approached us). She asked how we were doing, which was really nice I thought. But then she asked my brother to put his phone away, because the snap was ""ruining the ambiance."" LOL. This was hilarious on a few different levels, first of all, WHAT AMBIANCE THO? And second, it was way too loud to actually hear any sound from the phone, so it was unclear what she was referring to. We obviously obliged, but it was a really bad customer experience. I have never been told to do anything like this at a restaurant before. As for the 20% gratuity. I can appreciate gratuity for healthcare. But the service was so incredibly awful, that I felt like I had been scammed to be honest. I will never return and caution any of those who want to check this out. The cherry on top was the waiter handing the bill to my little brother. Lol... I was paying, but I like how he assumed my brother was. I could've forgiven that, happens all the time when I pay as a female (or maybe if the food was edible), but I handed him the bill with my card and when he returned it, he handed it to my brother once again. I mean, I had the card right in front of me at the table. Maybe consider not assuming that the male will always pay. This is one of the few negative reviews I've written, but well, people need to know. Especially when lines are out the door for this...""restaurant."""
5,"The food and service are top-notch but the business practices, not so much. Forcing a 20% surplus charge (a gratuity) on a table of two, which includes a 10% gratuity to the kitchen is nonsensical. They do this, supposedly, to every customer now. It disappoints me to have to rate them so low, but it simply isn't fair to the customer. Don't get me wrong, I believe strongly in tipping and tipping well. People who serve us well have earned our gratitude in the form of a good tip, even up to or above 20%, but to force this charge on tables of less than six to eight people isn't commonly practiced anywhere in the United States (or France) and, I assume, seldom elsewhere."
6,"We arrived at 11am and was told we would be seated in 30-40 minutes. We waited in our car parked right in front of the restaurant. Alas we heard our name being called and walked got out of the car and walked straight into La Note only to find out it was given away in the (30 seconds after we rush through the crowd). We had to wait another 20 minutes. Finaly we were seated but it was another 15 minutes until the waiter took our order for drinks and food. One of our coffees turned up, but my hot chocolate took forever - even the larger group next to us that had arrived later got their drinks first. At this point it was already 1:15pm. Our food eventually came. We ordered the oeuf de croq was really good, eggs cooked to perfection and the roasted potatoes and Provence tomatoes was excellent. The pancakes were too ginger and heavy - almost reminded me of cake. Â It didn't meet my expectation. Overall I definitely think it was not worth the wait nor price. The garden was nice but The service did not meet my expectation and would not rush to return."
7,"The fact that 20% gratuity is automatically included in the bill is the reason that service at this place is way below par. 20 mins after ordering we were told that they couldn't serve an item that we order because it was on the lunch menu...so we opted for a simple croissant because we were getting hungry. The other dish that we ordered was a potato and and caramelized onion omelet that took 40-45 mins to come out from original ordering. The table next to us that came in later got their food first. As a shop owner ourselves it's inconceivable how service like this gets overlooked by the owners. The food was not worth the 30 min wait to be seated and then the 45 min wait for the food.If service wasn't a factor, the food at best was average 2.5 stars. Bland and expensive. For a craft of wine and one omelet dish it cost us $50 (croissant not included - the least they could have done). Saying that food and service are two separate things is simply not true at a restaurant. Good restaurants have both and everything below likely only has one of the two.We still left them a tip on top of the 20% gratuity because we understand it's not easy, but we hope it can get better. We did leave a comment on the service in hopes of leaving some ""food for thought."" We are also surprised to hear that the owner who claims to be a passionate foodie and a Berkeley grad would let this pass in our neighborhood.Good luck to you and those who dine at this place. We hope you have a better experience."
8,"Didn't get to eat here. So disorganized. Hostess kept moving people around on their list and we kept getting pushed down. Promised a 15 min wait when we showed up, then told it would be another hour after already waiting 50 min. Get organized or get out"
9,"Ugh not good... steak and friets like from a cheap diner only difference is you'll pay 22.50 here. Steak no flavor, fires just cheap frozen kind. We also got dessert bread pudding and pear w/ ice cream both sucked and 9 bucks each! On top of that 9.00 surcharge! Woulda been happier at mels diner LOL! big bill, crappy food, thoroughly disappointed"
10,"Since the first time trying La Note, everything has definitely gone downhill. The food is good (not anything out of this world) but not for the price, and certainly not for the wait. The last two times while waiting, I was told the wait would be about 20 minutes but that eventually became closer to an hour. Misestimating the time by 10 or so minutes is okay, but anything past 30 minutes is problematic. That doesn't include how long it'll take for you to order or get your food! They've also added a 20% surcharge on the bill which is a slight issue. It shouldn't be required if the service was less than subpar. Probably won't be coming back!"
11,"Seems the rave reviews are for brunch, so perhaps our experience would've differed had we dined in the morn. But I doubt it. We came for dinner last night and while the service was friendly and prompt-ish and the atmosphere was charmingly oh-so French countryside, the food was an overpriced disappointment. We ordered the spinach salad with goat cheese first, which started out optimistically: not over or under dressed and the greens were fresh - but it came with just one little slice of roasted tomato. Really it needed more, because once we consumed our measly ration of tomato the salad was quite literally just a bunch of leaves. Moving on. For our entrees, we ordered the bouillabaisse and the roasted chicken (poulet au pruneaux). The chicken was tender, albeit a little too white wine dominant, and with a dearth of mushrooms. The bouillabaisse, though, takes the prize for the grand ol' disappointment of the night and the distinction of being the worst I've ever had. Not enough salt, not enough flavor, not enough oil, not enough bread (hand over a whole mini baguette please, quit with the stinginess already), not enough herbs, and the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance: overcooked seafood. This sad little dish was most surely absently thrown together and quickly boiled up (no slow simmer love here), for even the flavors of the onions and celery never came together. No one was tasting it along the way, and I'm pretty sure they didn't even start it with fish stock. Zero f's were given when making this stew, and a resulting zero f's were tasted when consuming it. We paid (much too much for this flavorless meal), tipped, and left, and won't be coming back."
12,Purely a bathroom review. AVOID! Wretched smell of piss will eliminate any appetite you have. Is bleach not a permissible means of cleaning in Bay Area restrooms? Wondering if business owners understand how a bathroom affects the overall restaurant experience... The area definitely takes first for dirtiest bathrooms in the US.
13,"Came here on beautiful Monday morning, we got seated right away since there wasn't a lot of people. The hostess sat us by the window so it's overlooking the whole dining area.We ordered the Omelette de pommes de terre & Omelette Au Frommage the food was a lil short in flavor, we were a bit disappointed . Beware of the 20% surcharge on your bill."
14,Not worth waiting that long at all...Omelet was hard and pastry basket was just okCreme Fraiche Pancake was good.Service was terrible. I spent more than 20 minutes to get the server's attention.
15,"Heard so many good things about this place and decided to come here with a couple of friends. Pretty disappointed overall. I came on a Sunday at 11am which I guess was my first mistake because the wait was SO LONG. I expected a long wait, but I did not except to take two and a half hours before I was seated. When we finally got inside, the restaurant was extremely crowded and there was very little room to move around. The service was not great either. Maybe it is because the servers were so busy, but we got our menus and had a lot of trouble flagging someone down to take our order. And then after we finally got our orders taken, it took another HOUR to get our food. When we asked how much longer it would take for our food to come, the server just kind of shrugged us off and said the kitchen is very small so orders took a longer time to come.After all of this, I really expected the food to be exceptional but again, I was disappointed. I got the cinnamon french toast and my friend got an omelet, which I tried. My french toast was good for a few bites before the cinnamon overwhelmed every other taste. Looking through my food, I just found globs of cinnamon everywhere. My friend's omelet was not anything amazing either. The server said it would come with hash browns, but those ended up just being some potatoes with salt and pepper. Some of these were even undercooked. On top of everything, the food here is definitely overpriced for its quality.I don't think I will come here again unless this place is much less crowded. Overall pretty bad experience for all the amazing things I had heard from my friends."
16,"Mediocre. Â Overly hyped. Â I do not recommend. Â Long wait. Â French toast was bland, lavender syrup was not for me. Â Ham and cheese omelet average. Â The Apple sausage, potatoes, and croissant saved the meal. I am not cheap when it comes to food. Â But 50 dollars for breakfast better put out. Â  Breakfast social club runs circles around this place. Â  Overview. Â Waited 40 min for a table when we were told 20 min. Â We are patient, we understand it is popular. Â Sat down ordered waited another 30 min. For our food. Â Everything minus the pancake came out. Â Then the waiter realized it and brought it out 10 min. Later. Â I was hoping he forgot. Â  They should consider not taking in so many customers if they feel they cannot accommodate everyone. Â Wait staff felt overly rushed and fatigued."
17,"I'm so disappointed by this restaurant. I came here on a double date with a friend, and I was excited to have brunch in Berkeley for the first time. This place came up with high reviews on Yelp, and the anticipation for brunch is always heightened by a long wait. The restaurant was overly packed to the point where I had trouble hanging my jacket on the back of my chair without almost hitting the table next to us. The service was alright, not memorable.The food was not good, to say the least. I ordered the Brioche Pain Perdu with Compote. Normally I would order something savory, but this fancy French toast caught my eye. The brioche turned out to be extremely dry, made better only by the compote, which was honestly the best part of the meal. As I usually do, I sampled some potatoes and other savory entrÃ©es from my friends, and nothing tasted good to me. All the food I tried was dry was flavorless. Maybe it was just the day we happened to be there.I'm not sure why this place is so popular, but I would certainly not recommend it to any brunch-goers or return again for another try."
18,"Cons:Both Gingerbread and crime fresh pancakes were not eatable, they were either undercooked or are meant to completely stick to your palate. We sat down, ate for 5 minutes and decided to leave. It was really unfortunately, especially that there's a 20% mandatory service fee add on. No one asked us why we were leaving so quickly or whether something was wrong with the food. Pros: Came here at 8am on a Saturday morning and didn't have to wait in line.Staff is friendly and attentiveCoffee is good"
19,"I rarely leave reviews, but this one needs it. Ambiance is nice, and probably other things on the menu are better than the pancakes. We had high hopes for ginger lemongrass and creme fraiche pancakes, they were terrible. Undercooked and sticky. The coffee was good."
20,"I took my yoga friend to branch I order omelette and tomato veggie cooked plate charge $16 my friend had oatmeal only and 2 latte include tip almost $50!!!!!?? Too much ! Over charged I should have gone to other breakfast place "" other side 2 wice cheaper and same foods!!! I don't want come here no more ! Â  Totally not recommending ! Stonehenge"" way better it's down street ... price for someone don't want pay $50- for breakfast in 8am!!!"
21,"Without fail, every single time I come here there's always an issue and their staff cannot be bothered when you bring it to their attention. Their food is good, but their service is horrible and they now have the audacity to charge a 20% surcharge on all their bills. What a joke! I walked in and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair, and she put us in a table on the corner that could barely accommodate two people. We felt bad because we were hovering over the couple next to us, so I brought it to the hostess' attention. The waiters kept asking if we were ready to order, and we told them that we were waiting to be seated elsewhere. After a 10-15 minute chaotic moment, they gathered enough brain cells to figure out that we indeed needed a different table. It should be illegal to obligate your patrons to pay a surcharge (in other words, tip) when the staff is rude, inconsiderate and less than smart. I guess it's safe to assume that I'm never stepping foot in here again."
22,"This place is very cute and after reading the reviews, I was very excited to come here. I'm a pescatarian so as you know I don't eat meat, only fish. I also only eat egg whites and don't eat the yoke since it's a chicken. Yes, the chicken isn't born, but I don't want to eat it. I wanted to order egg whites and the waiter quickly said no, we don't do that. The fact I could only order oatmeal,!french toast or pastries was irritating. I don't understand why any place can't cook a customer egg whites. I have never been to a restaurant in California that wouldn't make me egg whites. So... what did I order? French toast thinking it's normal thin toast and oatmeal to change up the taste. The French toast was super thick... but really good because of the lavender honey, the oatmeal was scorching hot and by the time I finished my French toast I was full and the oatmeal still was barely edible. After eating such thick French toast, I feel as if the button on my pants is going to pop off which is a terrible feeling. A feeling I wouldn't get with a nice plate of egg whites and bread. After we finished our breakfast, our bill came with 20% tip included. I've been a server and to be honest, I'm not ok with it unless you worked your ass off as a server to your customer. 10% goes to the server, 10% is split between everyone els; kitchen and such. Why should I have to give a tip to the kitchen who won't make egg whites for a customer? I know it may seem ridiculous, but that's just me. Yeah, a 10% tip for a server isn't that great, and I wouldn't give him any less.. I'd probably give him 18% even though he didn't care to try and see if they could make me something simple as egg whites. My whole experience wasn't fantastic, and it's unfortunate because this place seemed like it would be an awesome breakfast place."
23,They canceled our Opentable reservation suddenly without any explanation given by email. The reservation was confirmed once. I was to host friends visiting Cal from abroad. I wish I can make minus star if possible. Terrible. Arrogant.
24,"We got here around 10:30am on a Sunday morning and already saw a crowd of people waiting around outside. This place definitely seems popular, but we only waited for about 30 minutes (for a table of 3) to get seated, which wasn't too bad especially since there's a small bench to sit at inside. I ordered the Cote Nord plus a cappuccino, which by the way comes in a huge bowl shaped cup! I didn't even end up finishing it because there was so much. The Cote Nord was good, but after awhile the cream cheese in the eggs gets to be a bit much. My gripe about this place, however, revolves around my customer service experience. Beware this place charges an 18% service fee! I didn't realize this until the next day when I was scrolling through their Yelp page and read a few reviewers mention it. That means I actually double tipped, which ends up being over 30% for the slow and very average service we had received! I called the restaurant to see if they could partially refund me. Honestly, I know that this was my mistake for not reading through the bill carefully, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to at least try to ask. I explained the situation to Beth from the restaurant, and she told me that it was too late to refund me because they had already paid taxes on what I had paid. When I asked if there was anything that the restaurant could do to help the situation, she said to me, ""I just want to make sure you understand that you are asking the restaurant to give you free money."" She said this like three times. It just felt so rude and off-putting. Yes, I still understand that it was my initial mistake, but usually businesses value their customers' experience and do what they can to help. This didn't feel like the case at all. Beth then told me that if I emailed her and explained the situation again, she would present it to her manager to see what they could do about it. But the phone call was already a huge turn-off, and I felt belitted by the experience. I ended up just opting to call my bank, and they quickly refunded me. Bless them! When I was telling the story to the rep at Chase Bank, he was even like ""Wow that sounds like horrible customer service from the restaurant."" As a side note, Chase Bank - superb customer service. Sign up with them if you haven't already!!"
25,"Unpopular opinion: I don't understand the hype behind La Note. I didn't really like it when I first tried it as a Cal student and after giving it another try this past weekend, I still don't think it's all that great. To give you a sense of where I'm coming from: It's not that I hate French food. I love French food! It's just that I think I have higher expectations than average when it comes to French food because my family has some history in France and Quebec. And if I've got high expectations, my parents have even higher expectations, having studied in France and having met and married there. Like, for me- I'll be upfront and say that there are plenty of French dishes where I've got no frame of reference in whether or not it's ""authentic"", so I will never, EVER use that word. My mom though, if she really likes something, might say something along the lines of ""oh this is so good, this is exactly what you'd find in a restaurant in France"". So having said that, of course one of the first places I ever took my parents to when I started studying at Berkeley was La Note. This was a good 7-8 years ago, so memories have faded, but the only thing that my parents really liked was the bread basket. Fast-forward to 2016. Thrillist has featured La Note as one of the 11 most essential brunch spots in the East Bay and I figure- why not give it another try? If it's better than I expect, then maybe I'll bring the parents around for them to try again. Sadly, I still won't be bringing them here. I ordered the Tartine and the Brioche Pain Perdu, whereas my friend got one of the egg dishes and a side of the Creme Fraiche pancake. I tried a bit of her Creme Fraiche pancake and it was actually quite tasty. For me, I loved the Tartine- the baguette was delightfully toasted/crunchy and the homemade butter/jam combination was delicious. It came at a bigger portion than I expected but made sense with its $4.50 price tag. I wasn't expecting to finish it given that I still had my Brioche Pain Perdu to eat, but I eventually did, because I hated the pain perdu. I had hints of the lavender honey when I ate it but more bites were without the lavender honey than with. Without the lavender honey, the pain perdu didn't taste like anything to me, and was a lump in my mouth that I had to force myself to chew and swallow. I ate about half of my brioche pain perdu, stopped, and decided that if I was going to stuff my stomach with bread, I was gonna do it with one that I actually enjoyed, so I finished the Tartine instead. So it's the same as it was 7-8 years ago. The food is forgettable, but the bread is good. 2/5 and will likely not come back because I'm not waiting over an hour for baguettes, butter and jam. Disclaimer: I don't really like egg dishes in general except when the yolk is gooey. Given that half the menu is pretty much eggs, that decreases my interest in coming back. This obviously won't be true for everyone and would greatly affect other people's opinions of the place. My friend (Tiffany L.) wasn't impressed with her omelette, which I'm sure she'll go into in her own review. While I'm on the subject of eggs though, the only thing I would've picked for myself is Oeuf a la Coque, which my grandpa used to make for me all the time, but I'm not about to pay $11 for two eggs, toast and homefries."
26,"Food was decent, but the mandatory 20% gratuity added to the check with notification after the fact, was irritating. Maybe the mandatory tipping added to the less than attentive service and long wait for our food. Why does the staff need to make an effort when the reward is already built in?"
27,"It's mind blowing to me that this place gets 4 stars. Â We had dinner here before a show at Zellerbach the other night mostly because it was so close to the venue. To be fair, the waitstaff were all very sweet...albeit very young, inexperienced, disorganized, and slow. There was no head of staff or any seemingly senior person on site that evening at all which seemed weird. I'm not even sure the kid who was serving us wine was old enough to legally do that. And, well, the food was just bad. Soggy pasta. Oily cheese appetizer. Is this place Italian? Is it French? It's mediocre either way. I'd be delighted to see them up their game given their location."
28,"I can understand that I have to wait 40 mins to get inside. What I don't understand is, once I am sitting, why they took another 40 mins to take my order and yet another 40 mins to bring the order to table. At the end of the day, I just want to have some eggs as my Sunday brunch. It shouldn't take 2+ hours.On the other hand, the food was pretty good as usual."
29,"I wasn't pleased with the service. I had to twice get up from my chair and ask for the waitress. I was planning on lowering the tip and pleasantly discovered that a 20% surcharge was added to the receipt. No wonder the service was below par. Even mentioning on the receipt of an additional 5% tip to the server is beyond ridiculous. Needless to say, I will not be coming again."
30,"Meh I've had better. Maybe I definitely had better last time I went. The brioche was still really good. Â i ordered the potato and caramelized onion omelette and it was not great. Â Potatoes were a bit undercooked and there was just no flavor in the dish. Like none. I had to put a lot more salt and pepper than I like on the food just to get it to taste like something. Still a small place and there's not much room to maneuver around. Protip: just get the brioche. otherwise, everything else is just average."
31,"LA NOTE ENGAGES IN DECEPTIVE PRICING.20% surcharge on the bill, with an option to tip more if you're not paying attention. Pay your own employees La Note, diners shouldn't have to compensate your workers. If you really care about reasonable compensation work it into the price and leave off the tip line, absolutely deplorable practice.The food was forgettable, I had the Cote Sud. Sausage was okay but the rest was just a small servings of cheap bread, eggs and potatoes. Hardly worth $16.00 (actually 20.00+ when you consider all the hidden charges)I was still hungry after brunch."
32,"Went out for brunch yesterday at a 4-star rate restaurant on Yelp with most reviewed. We ordered and caramelized potato and onion omelette with roasted tomatoes + vegetable stew. The food overall is great. But we experienced really bad service here. We had to wait for the food for 40 minutes. Everyone else coming later than us got food before us. For instance, the waiter forgot one of our dishes. I wouldn't go back to try other foods on the menu and wouldn't recommend my friends to go .The food I will give 3 stars The service I will give 2 stars"
33,"Ate here last night (5/27). Â What a disaster. Â The manager allowed in animal rights activists who lectured customers for a half-hour about vegan food. Â The evening was entirely destroyed, and customers were insulted. Â Afterwards, the protesters moved outside, and the manager must have never called the police, because they never came. Â In other words, the manager did not act to solve the situation. Â And then, we get charged a 20% service charge despite the completely unacceptable ambience. Â My advice avoid this restaurant at all costs."
34,"La note has long been noted as a great place to eat breakfast. However I MUST disagree. Why? The 20% automatic gratuity to be split amongst staff, with a request for an additional tip for my server. This is a trend for some of the best restaurants, however a bread basket full of under toasted bread, undercooked pancakes Â topped with frozen blueberries and syrup that isn't real maple syrup? No! It was equivalent to eating at Denny's. The menu was ambitious and used to be executed beautifully. But La not is like an arrogant friend who doesn't realize that they are no longer relevant. Why did you change!! I ate for cheaper in Paris!!!! If you're going to flaunt a French identity you better bring it! Disappointing!!!One exception: Garlic rosemary home fries are perfection!!"
35,"This place is way overhyped. The food here is okay, but nothing to really rave about. Perhaps I'm biased because I'm used to all the great brunch spots in LA that really, in my opinion, are just incomparable. There is always a line here for brunch, sometimes up to 1 or 2 hours. The inside is cutely decorated but very cramped. You might be touching elbows with other people. However, I can't deny that it's a great place to catch up with friends and take nice pictures. I've tried the famous Brioche Pain Perdu, which was okay. Mine had a weird greasy, savory taste as if the chef cooked it in the same pan as bacon or some other meat product, which ruined it for me. But the bites without the greasy taste were pretty unique. The citrusy flavor was refreshing. The Nutella French Toast was yummy but very average. It tasted like Nutella inside well-cooked french toast, which is hard to go wrong with. The Creme Fraiche Pancake wasn't really my type of food. The pancake was soft and fluffy, but the flavor of the sauce was a bit off, and I love creme fraiche! Perhaps I just came on an off day, but I wasn't very impressed with the pricey food."
36,"This was my second visit to this restaurant. Â I was really pleased with the food during my first visit a couple of years ago. I wa disappointed with my lemon gingerbread pancakes. Â It was dry, heavy and doughy. Â I really liked this on my first visit here because it was light and fluffy.I was really disappointed because the wait wait was too long and the food was not that that good!I wouldn't come back to this restaurant."
37,"Teetering between two or three stars. Â An unusual conundrum when faced with a 4 star yelp rating, 2,000+ reviews. Â How does one rate poor service, and what was good tasting but barely-warm food? I don't mind a 30 minute wait to be seated for breakfast, I've come to expect it. Â Sadly, our server's head & heart didn't seem to be with it this particular Sunday morning. Â Other sections seemed to have more attentive servers, chalk it up to a bad morning for this chap? Â Had he asked, I would have said my potato and caramelized onion omelette was cooked perfectly, Provencales tomato were seasoned very nicely, albeit simply served past its prime."
38,"The food is ok, service could have been better. i had the ginger pear pancake, eggs and coffee. the pancake was the densest pancake i ever had. i am a bad cook but i made better pancakes from store boxes than the one i got. the eggs were fine. the tomatoes were nice.The main reason I am rating low is that they add a 20% surcharge automatically to all checks, doesn't matter the size of the party. The ""tip"" is a gesture of appreciation for a job well done. When it becomes a part of the check, its not a tip, its an expense the owner is passing along automatically to the diners, which is NOT ok. Its not like the menu was dirt cheap that they need to add 20% across the board. And they had the audacity to ask ""additional tip to your server is greatly appreciated"". this is a scam without doubt, scamming the customers that is. the entire menu is in French prominently with English on the side but if your order in French, the server can't understand it. not sure how to put it but pretentiouswill definitely not return."
39,Just overall disappointing. Overrated and overpriced. It ended up being more than $50 (they also have a 20% charge) for breakfast for two and nothing stood out. The drinks were lukewarm and the servers seemed unhappy. The omelet was not special- large hunk of plain egg. The French toast was somewhat tasteless. The chicken apple sausage was something you could heat up at home.
40,"I found the La Note very overpriced. The food is good and you cannot complain about it. Still it is nothing very special, really! The price therefore is very high ;) I think it is just not worth it."
41,"super slow serviceordered the lemon gingerbread pear pancakesthe texture of the pancakes was terriblegrainy, crumbly (?) and thicknot light or fluffy at allthe flavors were terrible - overly gingerbread-y without a hint of lemoni've never seen my friend do thisbut he literally took a bite and sent it backhe added a side of the chicken apple sausageturns out it is aidell's that you see at the supermarket -one pack is around $5they charge $4.50 for ONE link - wtfi ordered the les oeufs lucas (scrambled eggs with roasted tomato and goat cheese)simple, boring, and just okdefinitely not worth $12our other friend ordered the coffee cakewe all agreed this was the best thing any of us gotwhich was actually very goodthe sour cream added a great moistness and flavor to the cakecome here for the pastries (maybe? Â at least the coffee cake)but skip the foodi've definitely had betterand i would not wait in line for this"
42,"Status Quo in this Town. Mediocre service from the tall thin waitress. The hostess was very good and knowledgeable of her tables. The waitress seemed like she was jealous my daughter was prettier than her. After 45 minutes and no coffee refill we asked the manager about our food and refills of coffee. The food some out 5 minutes later. My over eggs completely cold and the sour dough toast was Â small water cracker size, hard as a rock and cold. The manager comp'd the coffees so I left $1.50 tip. Rarely, do I leave such a tip but, the bizarre attitude of the waitress and the temperature of my food lead me to believe she didn't want to serve us."
43,"Way too overhyped! Not sure if it was the wait, the atmosphere, the service, or the area. A little overpriced for brunch I would say, the French toast that I ordered, was not even TOAST! it was pretty much cut up baguette! OH but the ratatouille was BOMB, I would get that if I ever return here. overall the food was pretty mediocre, theres better brunch places down the street and around the block. the line is long here on the weekends. but the service is superb though. p.s. they would not seat you unless your entire party is there. what? Â  Â  Â  oh and put you name on the waiting list on the brunch places around the block in case the wait time is over half an hr."
44,"Let me preface this by saying that my family and I have been eating at La Note for at least 5 years now and we are accustomed to the long line and having to wait for a table. But the service we experienced a couple of weeks ago (brunch on 2/18) was unacceptable. Please retrain the current hostess or hire a new one.This is what happened:We arrived on a Saturday morning at around 9:20am, expecting to wait since it's the weekend and brunch time aka their prime hour. The hostess said we would have to wait 30-35 minutes for a table of 4. Not a big deal. I was expecting longer. We ended up waiting 75 minutes for a table (double the amount of time the hostess estimated!) and got seated at 10:35am. At around 10am they seat a table of 7 at a table that was meant for 4, and a table they could have seated us at. This table of 7 arrived way after we did, I know this because their name was further down on the list from ours. At around 10:10am there were two tables for 2 that opened up right next to each other and they could have pushed together these tables for us, a table of 4, to sit at. She instead chooses to seat two parties of 2 who, again, arrived way after we did. I was fed up because we were hangry, the hostess overestimated the wait time, and was messing up all over the place. So I finally went up and asked when our table would be ready. She said we were next in line, perfect!A table of 4 freed up right in front of us but the hostess did not seat us there. She instead seats a different party of 4, when she had just told me we were next. When I asked the hostess about it, she said ""Oh, I thought you said you didn't want that table."" I did not say that. She confused me with a girl in a party of 2 who insisted on a different table, note that the table in question was not even the same one I was asking about. She was confused about the whole situation. When another table of 4 finally freed up, there was no rush to get the table cleaned and ready for us. The only bright side was the waiting staff and the kitchen. Our orders were taken super quick and we got our food within 15 minutes of being seated. However, my sister did say her French Toast seemed to be a tad undercooked. Will I go back? Yes, I love their brunch. But I will check who the hostess is and walk straight out if it's that girl again (Caucasian, medium height, glasses, brunette). Maybe she was having an off day, but something needs to change. Side note: It was my sister's 25th birthday and this is one of her favorite brunch places and this poor service really put a damper on the day. Ok, I'm done. If you read through this long review, thank you!P.S. Our favorite dishes are the Brioche Pan Perdu (they've gotten stingy with the lavender honey over the years though) and Cote Nord."
45,"Seriously not worth it waited over an hour to get seated. When we finally did get seated, no offer of coffee.. ran out of water.. no refills offered. Almost another 45 minutes without any food while others who were seated well after us were served. Attempts to get water, service or basically any attention whatsoever were met with a dismissive turn of our servers head. This was atrociously Â terrible service. After investing almost 2 hours in this fiasco we actually got up and left before our food arrived- it was that bad. There is absolutely no fucking way we would ever return to this place and cannot figure out how it has the reviews it does. Save yourself the aggravation & head to Bette's, Venus or ANYWHERE else but la Note which probably translates to 'you're note importante to us' . If you are reading this I implore you NOTE to waste your precious time pining for this overhyped, time suck of a brunch."
46,"Been coming here for a couple of years now, but was super disappointed after my brunch - might be new staff or servers, no idea what it is but what a mess.Was told the wait would be 20 minutes, ended up waiting 45+ minutes. Was seated quickly. Waiter brings out pitcher of water with no cups, so we ask for cups a few minutes later. Cups were literally shoved at our elbows and slid across the table with no word spoken or anything of that sort.We then waited another 10-15 minutes for someone to simply come by the table to ask us to take our order. Food took another 20-25 to come out. From seating to getting food was about 40 minutes. Food was decent but pricy as everyone knows, but what a bust on the service.In all honesty, the La Note hype is not worth it, and I'll be finding another place to dine where I don't have to pay steep prices for egg & bread breakfast while getting disappointing service."
47,The food is mediocre while the wait and service is atrocious (probably because servers are tipped 20% regardless of their performance). Get brunch somewhere else and you'll be happier!
48,Food is fine but service is not really good. Everyone seems to be like unwelcome faces
49,"I don't often find myself in the east bay, but I had a few hours to kill before a wedding yesterday so I went in search of a good breakfast spot. La Note came up as one of the most popular places in downtown Berkeley so I put my name down and decided to give it a try.The wait was not that bad, about 15 minutes around 11am on a Friday morning. The coffee came along quickly, along with the friendly waitress to take my order. I opted to try the Brioche Pain Perdu, a single Lemon Gingerbread pancake and an order of the spicy lamb merguez sausage. I realize that this place is busy and they have a lot going on, but this is a small order for one person with nothing overly complicated in it. It really should not have taken 40 minutes to prepare. That was mildly frustrating.Brioche Pain Perdu - While the name is a bit intimidating, this dish was basically cinnamon bread french toast. I was not very impressed with this given how much it was mentioned in the reviews. I did like the subtle orange taste added into it, but otherwise it was fairly plain. The texture was decent, slightly fluffy and not too thick. I ate about half of it and I would not order it again.Lemon Gingerbread Pancake - This is what truly drew my attention while looking for places. I LOVE gingerbread, and I have had delicious lemon+x pancakes at other restaurants recently (Plow comes to mind). This dish came with pear slices and berries on top so it really does look impressive. Unfortunately it was nothing but disappointment. The pancake was too thick and doughy, the pears were clearly out of a can, and the berries clashed with all of the other flavors. I sadly ate less than half of this and was quite dismayed given my high expectations based on all of the attention this order got in other reviews. I would definitely not order this again.Spicy lamb merguez sausage - I only ordered this because the rest of my order was all bread and carbs and I figured I could use some meat to go with it. I'm glad I did because this was by far the best part of my meal. The lamb sausage was nicely flavored, with a juicy texture and just the right amount of oil cooked in. This was very good and I would order this again.Overall, I can see why this place is popular, but I just don't really think it deserves that much hype. Depending on how many other good brunch spots are in the area I could maybe see myself coming back. I'd definitely change my order significantly if I did though. Perhaps an egg dish would turn out better."
50,"This was our favorite restaurant in Berkeley, and we have gone here many times. However, they have now implemented a 20 % service charge on all orders. Just to be clear, I have no objection with tipping the staff, but if this is going to be a mandatary charge, it should be reflected on the menu as the COST of the item you are ordering. That would be honest, what they are trying to do is not. The cost of any item you order from their menu is 20 % higher than as shown on the menu, not including taxes. That is being honest, so reflect that in the listed price!I liked this restaurant, but not sure if I will return since I find this practice dishonest."
51,"So disappointed by this place. It looks so adorable, always has long waits and has such great reviews - you'd expect it to actually be good. But sadly it was not to be!I got the ginger pancake with poached pear. It looked pretty when it arrived, I'll give it that. But it was so very dry it was almost impossible to eat without dousing it in syrup - and then it was just too sweet and disgusting. The side of home fries was undercooked and almost raw. The folks I was with ordered eggs - their eggs were somewhat better but also nothing to write home about. The only thing we genuinely liked was the coffee cake. It arrived warm and was actually delicious. Service was fine, but overall we felt a little hurried. Annoying when you've waited over an hour for a table. Basically, this place just isn't worth the wait. You're better off going elsewhere and spending the extra hour enjoying the CA sunshine."
52,"Definitely best place to come if you like being told that your party cannot be seated because 1 person hasn't shown up AFTER waiting half an hour for a table. So basically after sitting patiently for half an hour, the waitress refused to sit us and instead gave our table to someone else. That's unacceptable and is disrespectful. What my money is not a good enough to sit down and have a cup of coffee while we wait for the last person to show up. Â I get better service at cheesecake factory."
53,The food was good but not worth the price or service. Breakfast for two came out to $80 and the waitress checked up on us only once the entire time. I don't understand the hype of this place. I could have went somewhere better for cheaper.
54,"It's really just okay. Â Food has a nice presentation, but I really thought it was mediocre at best. Creme friache and oatmeal raspberry pancakes were unique, but they aren't things that I would crave for or rave about. Same goes for the cote ouest. Service was descent, but I saw our waitress getting frustrated with other tables. Restaurant itself is cute but avoid the tables by the windows, they are filthy and disgusting with gnats and moths flying around constantly. My sister and I couldn't handle it so we asked to be moved. Â But still, the place is insanitary."
55,"I wish I could give La Note ZERO stars because nothing was good about my experience. My husband and I arrived before noon and was sat relatively quick. We waited five minutes or so to place our breakfast menu after our waitress took our drink orders. Fast forward to 45 minutes after we placed our order... still no food. What made us even more frustrated was a table of four was sat next to us and their food came before ours. Our waitress had no regard for the delay; she wasn't apologetic and why, because she was going to receive a tip either way. You see, La Note leaves this note on your table telling you that a tip will be added to your bill ""to help the serving crew out."" In normal circumstances I would be ok with this but today this waitress was owed nothing! The food was mediocre and the service was less than desirable. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
56,"This review focuses on wait time for your table and your food! Just a heads up...Getting seated can take up to an hour or more for a group, regardless of what the hostess tells you (most tables are for couples the wait for those is shortest). And know there isn't a waiting area or bar, so you will need to wait outside on the sidewalk. Reservations are highly recommended, especially for a group of 4 or more.We stopped by La Note on a Friday morning to try & snag an open table, a commodity apparently more elusive than a Berkeley parking spot. Knowing it's a very busy place, I called ahead to inquire about the wait, and asked if dogs were OK (yes, outside). The hostess confidently explained that the patio had just opened and there was seating available!Although we arrived quickly, it took 10 minutes to work our way up the line to get our name in . The hostess explained the wait would be 20 minutes. OK, cool. To be fair, we'd requested the patio because of our dogs, so I expected to wait a little longer.Over an hour later (still waiting), I asked about our table and was told ""it should be ready soon. The kitchen is really backed up though, so food's taking a long time.""Hey, I get it. La Note is The Sh*t and everyone (without a reservation) should expect to wait. But really, the owners could be more respectful. Had I gotten a more honest estimate of our wait time, we could have better decided whether to stay or go elsewhere. And we did, one block down to Venus, for a relaxed, delicious brunch that was deftly served. Think of Venus as your plan B if the wait is too long at La Note."
57,"Great food, but the service is terrible and the wait is way too long. I waited an hour for a simple order of pamplemousse, and my best friend waited an hour as well for her pancakes and eggs. We arrived at 9:45, and got our food at 10:46. We overheard another waitress telling a family of three to simply come earlier if they, too, didn't want to wait an hour. This is unacceptable service, and I will not be tipping well."
58,"Don't do it! Put our name down at 11 am, seated at 12:15 (after extremely flustered and unqualified hostess mistakenly gave our table away because of a ""misunderstanding"". Ended up having to wait another 15 minutes and finally got seated. Once we ordered, it took another hour and a half to get our food. Once our food arrived my entree was wrong and our unapologetic server explained that ""the runner picked up the wrong entree"". Do not understand the purpose of a 20% surcharge on all checks for employees, but no service?Guess they created that policy as a safety net Â to their little to no service. ^And THAT is why the wait to eat here is so long. Don't do it!"
59,"The one star is not for the food. Â Because the food is amazing and the place is extrememly cute. Â I used to go a lot. Â In January, I found on my bank statement that there was extra money added to my tab. Â I sent the restaurant a note to contact me right away because I wanted my funds back. Â They called me and told me to give it a few more days because sometimes banks hold a tip amount. Â Of course this is news to me so I wanted to give them the benefit of a doubt. After a few days there was no change I called the bank and they don't hold funds for restaurant tips. Â All this time has gone by and life just interfered, Â and I never called back. Â I almost felt bad like I can't ask for my $8 now... Â Bottom line is I wish this would have just been taken care of the first time instead of making me go out of my way to confirm my waiter didn't take an extra tip."
60,"So, as I said before, I'd only come back to La Note if my friends really, REALLY wanted to eat here. This time, we had reservations because we had a party of 7, this was convenient. Our table was nearly reserved. But as we all sat down, one of the girls had a SPIDER hanging out on her menu that was on the table. Ugh I just can't.. Major turn off already. We didn't say anything because we didn't want to make a scene, but that's twice that I have found something that's lingering in the wrong places. But I must admit, our waitress was really nice & attentive. I ordered the potato & onion omelette *insert French name here* The omelette came we toast & 3 grilled tomatoes. For 13.50$, the omelette was blah, not much flavor to my eggs, & not much potato either. I don't understand why it's so expensive for a plate of whipped eggs with a few slices of Idaho potatoes & grilled onions... BUT, The grilled tomatoes were delicious tho. Nice acidity and grill taste to em. Eh, I am still not a fan of La Note.. Sorry.. Not impressed again."
61,"Yes, the food might be good but on a sunday morning we waited for 45 minutes with two young children. And, it would have been Â longer if my wife had not caught a mistake by the hostess. Anyways, after sitting the server was in rush, impersonal and borderline rude. We understand that this place is busy but people come and stay in a long lines for the experience. We were made feel unwelcomed and under-serviced.To top it all, our server made a mistake in our order but we were just too uncomfortable even returning it back so we ended up not even having the right food."
62,"Omg. The hassle this restaurant gave us. About 1mo ago, my friend called to make a reservation for today because their website says to call for weekend reservations. In the conversation, despite hearing that they don't take weekend reservations, my friend reiterated that 10/1 is on a Saturday and asked whether or not we'd need to change our reservation which was scheduled at 1pm. The lady she spoke to reassured her that the reservation would be there since it was early enough because this was 1mo ago. She never received a call that this reservation would've been canceled if it was scheduled and if someone told her that, and didn't uphold their end of the conversation, that is just as bad. If we had known that this wouldn't be honored, then we either would've came there way earlier OR just found another restaurant. What a waste of time. Never coming here ever."
63,"Completely overhyped. I had been pushing my parents to come here with me for a brunch date, but my mom--quite the accidental Berkeley foodie--kept resisting. ""La Note's not that good,"" she would say. ""But how could close to 2000 reviews on Yelp be wrong?"" I would counter. To which she would facepalm.We ordered the lemon ginger pancakes, the french toast, a couple of omelets, and a side of chicken apple sausage. Everything was forgettable except for the sundried tomatoes and the roasted garlic that accompanied our sausage order, but neither of those things are why we brunch in the first place, am I right?The french toast was probably my second favorite thing, as the cinnamon brioche was satisfyingly thick and eggy. If you're like me and prefer sweet things for breakfast/brunch/all the time, then the french toast here is your best bet. But it's certainly not worth the wait that I've seen some people endure (we lucked out and waited only 15 minutes that day).To top it off, our waitress seemed to hate us and rarely checked in. Our table was also uncomfortably small for 5 people and 4 orders of food. At least there's a functional bathroom and the ambiance is cute. Visually, I can see the appeal of a place like La Note--especially when Berkeley is enjoying a nice sunny day like when we went--but my tastebuds and stomach typically cast the final vote when I write my Yelp reviews.Sigh, I hate it when my mom is right."
64,"I'll start by saying the food was very good, we had potato omelette and ham omelette. also tried the pancakes, light and fluffy, they were actually amazing. thank God the food was good because the attitude of the employees left much to be desired. Are the owners just blind or don't care about their business? The host doesn't say hello or makes eye contact when guests walk in and was sitting on a chair(?) I mean sorry to interrupt but can we have a table for two please. Then she slams down some menus and some water. About 10-15 goes by until the ""server"" comes over.....the place only had about 3 tables so not like it was busy. Â He says, ready?! No hi no hello no do you have any questions, nothing. We Awkwardly ordered our food... Asked about chocolate croissants? Just a ""no"". No suggestions or apparently no idea how to wait tables. Some other person dropped off the food and actually asked we needed condiments that was nice. There was food debris on the floor and dirty towels left on top of tables that were in the process of being bussed in our sight the entire time....Saw about 5-6 people ""working"" but halfHour to bus two tables, it's unimaginable . I can't say I'm shocked because this is the general type of service you get all around the Bay Area. I really enjoyed the food but i doubt we will return. The restaurant should just have counter service, saves them labor and saves you from ""having"" to tip 20% Â for bullshit service."
65,The only good part was being seated by the window . The waiter was horrible . Rude and completely ignored our table while checking in with others more than once . I had to ask the water guy to ask him to come over twice and I waited for my second glass of wine for 15 mins . Â Basically acted like he was doing me a favor . The place was busy yesterday but I know when it's just bad service . I still tipped him 20 % but he deserved O I won't be back . Â I should have just stayed with my regular French bistros but it was a bday brunch for a friend
66,"The food is great, esp my Omelette. Giving 2 stars is because the real bad service. No one took order, no one offered water, a waiter delivered the food and asked if need plate to share the veggie stew, we said yes, then nothing happened... what a awful place to eat. We will never go back again."
67,"We were seated promptly and then promptly ignored. After perusing the menu and deciding on our entrees and bottle wine, we looked around and realized that people who were seated after us were offered water and bread. Â One group that arrived after us was even served their entrees. After being seated, no one ever came to our table. After 30 minutes of waiting and watching everyone else be served, we left. The hostess looked at us without offering an apology or explanation. Disappointing experience after hearing such good things. Too bad."
68,"In all my dining I do not think I have ever been to an eating house that is more disrespectful of a customer.....!We were walks up and clearly when we arrived it was clear this joint was busy. So we put our names down on the list and understood that we had to wait 90 minutes...ok, all this is fair! We returned some 5 minutes inside the hour and half, and we were initially told to wait another 15 minutes. Still acceptable, and so some of our group decided to go for another stroll whilst others just waited. Then soon we got 'told', your table will be ready in two minutes, to which I replied some have gone for a walk so we will need to find them, to which I was told 'you need to come now or you may loose your table' .... we scrambled and managed to round the others up very quickly! We were ready and a sense of anticipation prevailed...finally.Soon that 'two minutes your table will be ready' blew out to 18 minutes........we finally sat down and the mandatory tap water in the bottle arrived. After a further twenty minutes we requested a menu...eventually it arrived, 'dumped' on the table...another ten minutes and after pleading for service someone came. The order was delivered..phew maybe some joy now!Well 40, yes 40 minutes laters some of the orders started to arrive....the first recipients waited for the other persons dishes to arrive before starting. Another 10+ minutes and now we had some cold dishes....Cradle to grave we waited 188 minutes or simply 3 hours!Some of us did not finish...the Omelette Fromage was awful, so wet that a spoon was the only means of consumption ...and the Short Stack Lemon Gingerbread was not a pleasant eat. The small Nicosia salad was fine and the rest is nearly forgettable - probably 30% of what was put on the table wasn't eaten despite our desire to satisfy our hunger.In the end the part that of this experience that is important is the inexcusable attitude that this eating house thinks its time is more valuable than a citizen. We were pawns abused and even worse our circumstances were taken advantage of .... no ethics or integrity and I left to wonder what happens with the food out of sight!Never ever again ...ever, will I return and this is probably my poorest yelp review. The day was 2 November and our server was Heather who Â felt sorry for us and who did kindly apologise!"
69,"Coming back after the college days, this place is a disappointment. Expect long lines that are not really worth it. We waited about 30-45 minutes. This time being seated inside by the window, you would think it's more privacy so it's better. Yea it was not as clustered as the rest of the restaurant. But I was constantly visited by flies. That's just straight up annoying when you're trying to eat. The table is already small and wobbly. I fear that my attempt to shoo away the fly might cause a table flip.Anyway, I had their omelette with tomatoes. I wasn't impressed with the food all that much. You know that feeling where it's like ""yea, it has my favorite ingredients.. tomatoes, eggs..."" but it's just lacking some chemistry. I know my face very well if I enjoy a dish with simple ingredients for the sake of the dish had some amazing flavors or textures or just something that is unusually awesome. Well, seeing such a bad rating, you can tell that I did not have such a moment. Boo hoo. More so, on top of bad food, it's also a grumpy waitress. Yes I see that you're busy, but show some professionalism. You are in the food and service industry, you do want a bigger tip in the end too, right? But yea, unless I'm forced to come back, this wouldn't be a brunch choice for me anymore."
70,"We waited an hour, ok. Not so bad if service and food are amazing. Right?...Wrong. We had Daria as our server. She gave us the wrong order, and double charged us for our meal. Wait, it gets better. She wrote the gratuity on our cc slip! Like we couldn't/ wouldn't do that ourselves? Took another half hour to get it fixed. Won't be back"
71,"This place is cute and all BUT DO NOT come here on a Sunday for brunch unless: A) You won't be hungry for 2 hours B) You don't mind ~never~ getting your drinks refilled C) Once you DO get seated after waiting an hour, YOUR FOOD STILL TAKES AN Â  Â  HOUR D) You like watching the buff hipster flex while he pours water (not a bad thing) However, I will give them brownie points for giving us the check and returning it to us after it was signed with LIGHTENING speed. Â The waitress was really fast at that even though every other part of the experience took an hour for her to do. Â So kudos for fast check-returning abilities, waitress, I will not fail to acknowledge your skills there. Â As for the food, I ordered a ham and cheese omelet which was delicious, but I didn't really enjoy it because I inhaled it after waiting for it for 2 hours, like I literally ate it in 5 minutes. Â My boyfriend ordered a sausage baguette sandwich thing which was surprisingly small, the sausage was really skinny and that was all that was in the baguette. Â  He was definitely still hungry. If I do return, it will not be for brunching purposes."
72,"Big fat, Meh. Basic food and sub par service. It took 40 minutes to get a seat followed by another 45 to 50 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering. Our waitress never once checked on us during this time. After getting her attention she informed us that our food was on its way and apologized because the kitchen was backed up. This would have been ok if the food was brought to our table straight off the grill, fresh and hot; but it wasn't. All of our egg dishes were luke warm and our toasts and creme friache pancakes were straight up cold. Like they had been sitting on a counter, waiting to be brought to our table. Bleh! Couple this with an error on our bill and the food's lack of flavor (the pancakes were bland and the eggs needed salt) and you've got a very good reason to not return. And to be perfectly honest, I've had better pancakes and service at IHOP. Just saying."
73,"We were told the wait would be 45 min, and after over an hour passed and we watched everyone but us be seated (some people even walked in and were immediately seated), we were finally seated at a tiny table that was it meant to sit four, but we were a party of five. And then, they were out of the bread they use to make French toast, which is what we came for, so we left without eating. This is the second time we've come and they had run out of French toast. The worst part is when I put my name on the waitlist I asked whether or not they were out of French toast, they weren't. Then, since we were left to wait so long, they were. And, they didn't bother to tell me. So disappointed. I hope there actions weren't racially motivated."
74,"Just had to find out what people liked about this place...found out it's just another popular diner with average food, long wait to get a table but then you're asked to give up your table after your meal bec. people are waiting...service was good though. Had brunch items-- french toast, lemon ginger pancakes, Ratatouille vegetable stew, which were all fair, nothing to write home about. Â Tried La Note bec. of Yelp reviews but definitely NOT worth the long wait and stuffy business policy, sorry thumbs down here. (It may have been a bit better 12 yrs ago, before social media.)"
75,"Do not come here during prime time. Â You're looking at a 1 hour wait time to get seated and about a 40 min wait for your food. Â Super crowded seating. Â You're pretty much spending 2 hours from start to finish. Â Service seems a tad understaffed. Â Food is decent. Â But factoring in price, wait time, service and atmosphere, it's better to choose a different place."
76,"This place is PACKED, we got here 8:40am on a Saturday and it was filled. We got our table after 15 minutes of wait. The place is compact and everything is packed, you can barely walk between tables.Food:We got a baking soda-taste pancake food, we got food poisoning that afternoon. I only took one bite of it.French toast looks tasty yet without texture..Drinks:hot chocolate was goodhouse coffee wasn'tNoise level:Loud"
77,"A bit too pricey for the quality of their food. 2 eggs with potatoes, 2 sausages, and a few pieces of toast was $14.95. Their sausages were juicy, but overall it wasn't worth the price. The caffe latte was served in a chipped bowl, although it tasted fine. The tables were cramped together. The waiter also gave me the bill pretty early."
78,"You'd think for such a hot spot in downtown Berkeley, they would know to have more staff during dinner time. It didn't take too long to get our overpriced food, but getting our check was another story, then getting a waitress' attention to run the card took an extra five minutes on top of the already drawn out time. I work in the service industry as well, and the place wasn't even at maximum capacity, yet it had staff members frantically stumbling around like there was a hectic rush. On top of this, I had asked if we could be seated in one of the three empty window seats and was rudely told no, only to be told that they were reserved when I replied ""....ok...."". These tables sat blank my entire stay here. Despite what I've heard about breakfast here, I won't be going back."
79,"After wanting to come here for about a year, I finally had the chance to eat here when my friend booked the patio area for her birthday celebration. We all drove separately and most of us came on time with a few trickling in a bit later. We were each seated immediately upon arrival.They have indoor seating as well as an outdoor seating area. Very cute place, I really liked the decor, flowers and the entire scenery in the back. I would recommend sitting outside when the weather is nice. It's more cramped inside.A few people had to leave early to catch a game so of course they ordered first before the rest of the group arrived. A basket of assorted bread and water were served immediately. I also ordered a cup of coffee. The bread was decent, it didn't come out warm, but the variety was nice. Now because we reserved the back patio for a private event (had no idea my friend paid a $150 deposit for it and NONREFUNDABLE?!), we were given a prix fixe menu and we voted for menu #1 which included the assortment of bread (to share, 1 basket per table) and coffee/tea/iced tea plus 1 entree per person for $17 per person. Even though some people ordered first, the food didn't come out for a long time, now I'm not exaggerating, it took about 45 mins until their food came out. They informed the waitress they were in a time crunch so if possible to have the food packed to go after waiting 25 mins. They got their food and were able to make it to the game on time. Now, for the rest of us that were still there, we waited about an additional hour until our food came out. By then, I've already had 2 pieces of bread and 2 cups of coffee. Now I understand food takes time to make, we're a large party, and they're busy. But to have to wait that long for food was unreasonable.Even after that long wait, our food didn't seem like it was served right after being prepared. The food didn't come out hot and cooled down by the time they brought it out. So it was most likely sitting out for a while. Unbelievable, especially since we waiting a long time and didn't complain or question the waitress about the whereabouts of our food.I got the lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears based on the recommendations on Yelp with scrambled eggs and homefries. I was so disappointed with the pancake after reading all the great reviews and long anticipation. I couldn't even eat the pancake, I didn't like the taste at all. I could taste the gingerbread slightly, but it didn't have much flavor and was very bland. I could barely taste the lemon and I didn't think they complimented each other very well. In the end, I just ate the poached pears and blueberries on top. The only part of my meal I enjoyed were the homefries. These were cooked perfectly, seasoned well and came with large pieces of garlic, which I didn't eat but my friends enjoyed eating.Service was horrendous and nonexistent. Our waitress was rarely near our table. I could tell she didn't want to serve such a large group and she was unfriendly and gave us some attitude. It was difficult to grab someone to refill our coffee, waters, and tea. My friend also brought champagne and wine. They were nice enough to open the bottles for us and bring glasses. I'm sure there's a corkage fee, but I don't know the cost.I had an awful experience here and I definitely won't be returning. You can imagine the price of everything too, $150 deposit to book the patio plus $17 per person (we had a party of 15), plus additional corkage fees, and included gratuity (FOR SERVICE THAT WAS NONEXISTENT) and tax. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY! The only thing that made this day enjoyable was the company and the birthday girl. I definitely left disappointed and felt ripped off. Save your time and money and go somewhere else, it's definitely not a 4 star place."
80,"Came here for brunch with my best girl friend and we expected to wait. When i put our names on the list and inquired about the wait time the hostess told me 45 minutes, we hung out in the car for a while and wandered through the bookstore next door when I came back about 50 minutes later she informed me there was still a twenty minute wait. Normally I'd have been really upset about this but I'd heard this place was awesome so we continued to wait. 35 minutes later we finally got seated and were given a thimble sized pitcher of water and two shot glasses after about 15 more minutes our waitress took our order I got eggs and sausage, she ordered eggs and ham we decided to share the creme fraiche pancakes. WE WAITED ANOTHER 35 FREAKING MINUTES! And we still hadn't gotten our food. When I questioned another waitress after watching people who came in after us eat and leave we were told that there was a party of 16, I asked why no one had told us this before she actually shrugged her shoulders at me. When we finally got our food it was really unimpressive, the potatoes were ok, the eggs were cooked ok, my sausage was undercooked the pancakes were just meh. Bottom line, after all the crap this place put me through I at least thought the food would be awesome it was just ok and the bill was over $50!!La Note freaking sucks and I will never spend another dime there"
81,I love La Note and this review is not indicative of their great food. This is for the way I was poorly treated. I consider myself a regular as anytime I'm in Berkeley this is usually my first stop. They open at 8 am and we walked in at 8 am. The young lady standing by the espresso machine told us they were closed. I asked if they opened at 8 because maybe I was mistaken (but just confirmed on Yelp I was correct). Instead of answering my question she pointed rudely around the restaurant and said WE ARE CLOSED. There are so many ways she could have answered but she decided on being rude if she would have said we are running late and we are opening in half an hour I would have come back. It'll be awhile before I go back. She left a bad taste in my mouth. I can only imagine how she treats her co-workers and other patrons. Thankfully we were welcomed in to Venus with open arms even though the weren't open right at 8 am like their sign stated. We were welcomed with a great smile and a Happy Columbus Day!
82,"Sunday brunch. The hostesses here are the worst. Someone needs to train these girls on how to do it. I worked as a hostess and server for many years and took pride in it. As a customer, it is offensive to be on the waiting list and have several people after me on the waiting list be seated before me. When I pointed it out, instead of an apology, I got a bad attitude."
83,service of this resturant is terrible.The food is fine.Just for the terrible service we don't think we will go back.
84,"The food is 4 stars but the service needs work. The server had over 10 tables and not much help, everything took forever. Ordered after 10 minutes of sitting, another 10 minutes to get coffee (which I had to get up and ask someone for) finally got our food, ate & tried to pay. Which also took forever. I don't really think it was the servers fault, way under staffed for a lunch rush. I won't go back."
85,"Terrible service and very average food. I've always wanted to try La Note and I got the opportunity when my friend made a reservation for her birthday. We were offered prefixe menu, which was very expensive in retrospect - I.e, sharing the basket of bread with one table, one pancake (one!), scrambled eggs, bacon, and tea was $17! And that does not include gratuity or tip. I don't eat a lot, mind you, but I was still hungry after my meal. My friend also had to pay a $150 nonrefundable deposit just to book the patio! (Pretty appalling since they did not give us any particularly attentive service). The employees also don't seem like they enjoy working there. When we first walked in, the hostess blatantly ignored us (without so much as a ""hello"", or ""I will be right with you"") walked around the room for about five minutes before greeting us. Our reserved table was not ready 5 minutes before the time, but that's understandable. She said she would come get us when it's ready but she never did - we went up to her and asked ourselves. Some of us had to leave early from the group and we requested to place our orders first. Our waitress was initially understanding and pleasant. However, after 25+ minutes when we politely requested an update, her brash response was, ""it takes time to cook the food you know..."" This left a bitter taste in our mouths as we were aghasted at the way she spoke to us. Most people would have said, ""it should be coming soon, I'll check on it for you."" I'm not sure why she was so rude about it; of course we know food takes a while to cook!The creme fraiche pancake was good, but definitely not anything to write home about. I've had better pancakes elsewhere. I think it would be worth the menu price of $5, but not $17. The kitchen skimped on the scrambled eggs. The food is not worth the hour+ long wait that La Note seems to constantly have. The service definitely needs improvement since the staff is very inefficient and rude."
86,The 1 star is for service. Â Our server Lonnie was the worst. Not very attentive. We watched him go to all the other tables. After 15 minutes we had to ask the hostess for coffee. Â He came back after another 15-20 minutes to ask how we were doing. Â Food was slow coming out.It took him another 10-15 minutes to get our check and we could see him chatting at the bar.We would come back for the food but would ask to sit at another server's section.
87,"I don't generally like to write negative reviews, but as someone who really enjoys French food--I feel a sense of duty to bring some truth to these reviews. Â And maybe if the owners read it, they'll work on making some improvements.I was SO excited to eat at La Note, when a friend scheduled her birthday brunch here. We arrived on time on a Sunday with a group of 7 total. Â And we waited. Â And waited. Â And waited some more. Â Long waits can be forgiven when the food is worth it. Â In this case, it was not. Â I ordered the potato omelette. Â My boyfriend ordered the gingerbread pancakes. Â Everyone else in the group seemed to enjoy their food, but my theory is that no one wanted to say anything about the blandness of the food because our friend had chosen it for her birthday, or maybe the other folks just have no palate. Â I'm not sure. Â But the omelette I received was the most grossly under-seasoned, bland, breakfast I'd ever eaten. Â I mean my La Note breakfast makes Denny's look gourmet. Â At least Denny's breakfasts have flavor. Â I kept grabbing salt and pepper and ketchup and even tabasco in an effort to impart some flavor into this dish. Â It didn't taste bad. Â It really was flavorless. Â I could easily make something way better at home and not have to wait over an hour for it or pay $15 for flavorless eggs and potatoes. Â My boyfriend's pancakes were cold, and sadly, nothing special either. Â Breakfast was a total disappointment.Listen La Note. Â Here's the deal. Â If you're going to be the only or one of the only French brunch spots in the East Bay, you better start upping your game. Â The food I experienced a couple weeks ago did not even deserve to be associated with French cuisine. Â Please-oh-please, at the very least, instruct your cooks to start using some salt. Â Thanks,--Jamie M."
88,Below average lunch experience. The ham and cheese baguette was not good and tasted exactly like from a deli but for twice the price. They messed up my order and brought the wrong tuna sandwich. Tuna was overcooked. Nothing special. Coffee was a little better than at a diner.
89,"GO TO LA NOTE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE NO DINNER ON YOUR BIRTHDAY NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!La Note is a right place to go if you want to not be greeted, ignored, and be provided a table even if you make reservation one week in advance for your birthday!!!I made a reservation online and received confirmation one week before. I even mentioned I would be celebrating my birthday with my son. I asked them if it was possible to give us a table by the window, but didn't really hope for this special treatment.I am usually early for all my appointments, including restaurant reservations, but this time we could not find parking for a long time and had to park very far. We walked very fast with my son despite his headache. Even though it was a 15 minutes walk, we still arrived at 6:34pm (our reservation was at 6:30pm). When we came, I was surprised there was nobody at the desk. Then I saw a lady who was walking back to the desk. She didn't greet us, or smile, but instead went straight to the phone which rang after we had arrived. She talked on a phone for several minutes. When she was done, she finally looked at us and asked us what we wanted. I said we had reservation at 6:30pm. She looked online and said they did not have any table for us because it was already 6:38pm. I told her it was my birthday and she was talking on a phone all this time. She said that's their policy. I was in shock. When we arrived at 6:34pm, there was nobody coming or starting to eat. Clearly, she took somebody before the time of our reservation. I have been to many restaurants in the Bay Area, California, and in many other countries such as France. (I actually lived and studied in France.), but I Â never had such a bad experience. Treating somebody with a child on their birthday goes beyond simple lack of professionalism or poor customer skills, it tells you a lot about that person. As for business itself, it seems strange to me, there was no manager or anybody with whom I could talk that night. The same lady at the desk said there was no manager and gave me the phone number to call. I called right away, but there was no answer. The business owner of this establishment is clearly resting on his laurels, thinking that one miserable customer is not going to change their reputation. Indeed, one is nothing, but perhaps it is just a beginner of a future fall..."
90,"Food is ok, but I got a piece of glass in my home fries so I will never go back. The owner was also a jerk about not paying for my tooth that I chipped on the glass that was in my potatoes. So if you love glass in your potatoes and chipped teeth dig in!"
91,"Too expensive for what it is.La Note is a quaint place, with a very southern France bistrot atmosphere. Accordion player in a corner, wicker baskets on the walls... The menu strikes that note too (though I was hoping for more of the southern particularities and less of the ""steak frites"" and the likes). It's simple, quiet and puts you halfway on a trip to Nice.Problem is, the food in your plate does not take you all the way, you're kinda stuck in touristic arrondissement of Paris. The starters were fine, really good cauliflower soup (though the bread floating in it was very mushy by the time we got spoons to enjoy it), the crostini (tried goat cheese) really struck the right note... but it went downhill from there.The steak was kind of bland and not seared enough and the fries accompanying it were simply not any better than your average McDonald's. The feuilletÃ© de St Jacques was dry, with too much salmon that killed the rouille flavor I was hoping for and which was only barely noticeable in the back.Don't get me wrong, the food was ok, and I would certainly go to La Note as my local lunch cantina if I was working nearby .. and if the prices were not on par with top rated restaurants in San Francisco.I appreciate their new tipping policy and trying to give fair wages to all their employees, but $10-15 for starters and $15-20+ for mains when it only tastes like your average bistrot is just way too much, and the service does not make up for it.As we say in France, La Note est salÃ©e !I tried and I will not go again."
92,"Totally do not get the excitement over this place. My friend moved back to the bay area and wanted to go here. Arrived at 9:15 on Sunday morning and against my gut instinct, we waited an hour outside to get seated (the hostess quoted 20-30 minutes, of course). The seating was great, the decor is very cute and the wait staff are friendly. After that... meh. I had an egg and potato omlette that was bland bland bland. I kept pouring salt on it and it was still bland. The latte was horrible, worse than no taste because it tasted bad. My friend seemed to like her egg and cream cheese thing -- and said that's what she always orders -- so maybe the key is getting something high in fat and goo. BUT I can go to any breakfast spot with a 10 minute wait that gives me fat and goo at $5 less. Note: it's 3 hours later and I have a tummyache from the food. :("
93,"again, i want to love you, la note. your creme fraiche pancakes and perfectly cooked eggs are the stuff of brunch heaven. but you make it so hard. we tried the restaurant on a week day instead (given our weekend fiasco) and still had the same issues: this is NOT the place to take kids or families. in fact, i'd go so far as to say this restaurant's seating policy DISCRIMINATES against families. just like my former attempt to eat here, a 10-15 minute quoted wait time actually meant waiting 60 minutes. the same response when i inquired: ""we only have a few tables that accommodates a highchair."" honestly, folks. if a table can accommodate a chair, it can also accommodate a highchair. needless to say, we ended up at a crappy 2-top (even though we were a party of 2 adults and 2 children) even after our long wait.la note, in the future, please recognize that children are people. they take up space. they eat food. and their parents tip well... if they are treated with respect."
94,"Not too sure what all the fuss is about now that I have had breakfast here. Yelp kind of let me down on this one. Came in on a Sunday at 9AM. Hubs and I were greeted upon walking in. The hostess offered to share a table with another couple or we would have to wait. Â I'm not a huge morning person and I like my privacy so I opted to wait. The wait was about 15 minutes. We were sat at a small table in the dining room, given menus, silverware and waters. I noticed she was seating patrons outside on the patio but she didn't offer to us. Maybe it was full? The menu is not a typical brunch menu. It is two sided but they do not serve the salads and sandwiches on the backside until 11AM. The front had the pastry, egg, pancake, French toast and cereal options. I ordered the Cote Est which has two eggs, choice of pancake and choice of bacon or potatoes. I asked for egg whites and chicken apple sausage with the oatmeal raspberry pancake. The waitress denied me said they don't serve egg whites and substitutions are not allowed. So I ordered the potatoes to share with hubs. Hubs ordered the French toast brioche and sausage since he knew I wanted it but didn't order for myself. Yay he is thoughtful like that. The food took about 20-25 minutes. During that time we had our carafe of water refilled and looked around the restaurant at the decor of baskets and art. Then the plates of food arrived. My meal was okay nothing stood out. Scrambled eggs were plain, pancake was flat, small and didn't have much flavor. The potatoes were good roasted with onion and herbs and you can't go wrong with sausage. Once again Hubs had the better meal. The brioche was great. With the flavor of the cinnamon, the thickness of bread it wasn't soggy at all and sweet without needing syrup. Our waitress was fair. She brought everything we would need with the food but never checked to see if we needed anything else. We were sitting for awhile and asked for her to run the card without being brought the bill. I visited one of the two restrooms and it was in horrible shape. The place needs some TLC with cleanup and with some cosmetic up keep. One other thing I noticed was an employee braiding another employees hair for him behind the bar area. That grossed me out a little. There is a time and place for that.Overall for my rating:3-for overall food, quality and portions.2- for waitstaff service.1- for no substitutions this makes patrons have to order more and restroom being a disaster. Negative stars- hair braiding in plain view of patrons on the dining room floor. Adieu La Note, I don't think I will be back anytime soon."
95,"Worset dinning experience ever, went to this place this Sunday morning for brunch with my family and my 8 month old daughter. When we got there was about 11 am and there were long line wait out side which I kind expected because I know this restaurant is very popular, we wait for about one hour when we got in, it was 12pm. We ordered our food, so far everything was OK. Then we waited for another hour there is no food on the table, 3,4 table who got in after us already finished and left. We asked our waitress during the one hour of waiting couple times and she told us"" oh, their server put in their orders before I did"". "" OH, they came in before you."" Ext... At this point we were very upset so finally my mother asked for the manager. She came and told us. "" I checked for you and what happened is that we had the kitchens windows open and your order has been blow away by the wind, we will make your order now"" we were like for real? What kind of excuses is this? But anyways, we accept the managers apologize and waited again. OK here came the best part, because we were inside for almost 2 hours now and my 8 month old started to make funny sounds. We didn't want upset anyone around us so we went outside for a quick break, when we came back, our tablet was cleaned. The Manger was like "" OH, sorry I thought you all left"" are you kidding me, my daughters stroller were still inside how did you figure that we all left? Â Also, during the whole time, the server and manager acting like it was my fault, a waiter even said to me that"" today is a busy day, everyone is busy. I really not appreciate that you complain Â to me"" haha, I don't what to say at this point, after all this their attitude were like "" shut up, we are popular. We don't care""  Here you have it, after 3 hours of waiting, we been kicked out the restaurant. What a way to spend your Sunday morning"
96,"Was really disappointed with this place. French food will always be a little pricier, but the meal we got for the prices here is ridiculous. We had the mussels & chicken mushroom entrees, both very under seasoned & flavorless. The chicken tasted old, Â but the sauce it was served in was even worse. Ordered the lavender creme brulee, no lavender tasted. The white wine was okay, wasn't really impressed with the wine selection. Only good thing we had was the charcuterie, pate, and the apple ginger dessert. Perhaps France spoiled my taste buds on their traditional dishes, but this place does no justice to the cuisine. Thankfully there are reputable French restaurants in the city I can go to if I crave the cuisine again, but I will never come back here."
97,"Nothing Special.La Note has been around for years in Berkeley. On the weekends there is usually a large line to get in because it's known for its breakfast servings. Having gone there several times though I'm not impressed. The food is simply not that special. Today my family went and we had the chocolate french toast, pancake with home fries and sausage, and a ham and cheese sandwich. The french toast was basically a nutella sandwich and so thick that you could barely finish it. The pancake was rather plain. The best part was the sandwich and even then all of their sandwiches are rather basic and plain with the break, meat, cheese, and some small pickles. The other good thing was the home fries which were cooked with cloves of garlic. Still for the basic flavors and the prices they charge you could do a lot better for your breakfast or lunch choices."
98,"After seeing the long brunch line on Sunday, a friend and I decided to make reservations to come here on Monday. We made the trek down to Shattuck, and were seated pretty quickly. The place is very small, and apparently resembles a French cottage (looked like the furniture from Salvation Army to be honest, but thats just me). After looking at the menu and some yelp reviews, we decided on the les oeufs with merguez sausage and full stack lemon gingerbread pancakes (we picked those two because nothing else looked appealing really). The sausage was nice and spicy, but the eggs and potatoes were nothing special. Then we gave the pancakes a try, and although they looked appetizing for my instagram, they were rather bland in person. I appreciated the pears (they were the ones from a can, but they tasted good). Verdict: this place is mega-over-hyped, not worth a try."
99,"I had been here for brunch and wanted to come back for a birthday dinner; since the reviews for service and food have been good, I was surprised at the hostesses lack of customer service. I made a review for three people and was seated at a cramped two person table. Â When I asked if we could move to the four person table, I was told that was reserved for another party who hadn't arrived yet. Â I'm not sure why a reservation for four should be treated as such, while a three person reservation is treated as a reservation for two. Â We decided to leave. Â And went to FIVE at the Shattuck restaurant, a few blocks down. Â The service was stellar and the food was delicious. Â I don't think I'll be giving La Note a second chance."
100,"I am not a fan. I know this place gets good reviews and I kind of understand why people may like it. But I don't like places that pretend to be something else somewhere else. And even worse, if this pretending is far from original...La Note tries to imitate French restaurant. But the fact is, that being from Europe and commuting to France for couple of years, I can clearly say, this restaurant has nothing to do with Â patisserie. Apart from interior that pretends to be French, nothing in the menu reminds me of Paris. Omlettes, eggs sound little European, but do not look like. Needles to say I havent eaten even decent criossant anywhere in the US and La Note is no exception.So please accept this votum separatum from wave of great reviews and enjoy the good position you have anyway :-)"
101,"Our estimated wait for 5 people at brunch was 40-60, and it took about 70 minutes. They sat all 5 of us at a cramped, 2 seat table. The service was incredibly slow and the waitress was rude. The food ranged from ""OK"" to ""meh"".Will not return."
102,Most definitely overrated. My omelette was pretty bland and the potatoes were flavorless. The price and the taste definitely did not align. The service was a bit all over the place. A simple request for jam took two waiters way too long. I don't understand the hype. Added a star because the decor inside was cute.
103,"Totally underwhelmed.....If you like eating with flies this is your place! Â Ordered a ham omelette and it was runny and undercooked, and the juice from the eggs made my potatoes soggy. The potatoes had way too much rosemary by the way! Oh and if you eat inside, don't expect A/C. It's hot as hell in there. When my server Lonnie ask me how my meal was I let him know that I was displeased. He assumes I was asking not to pay for our meal, which wasn't the case. I was offended because being African American I get stereotyped all the time and this was no different. He cops and attitude saying well you ate some of your meal. I said ""I only said something about the good because you asked.""Will never return to this place."
104,"The place is very cute. Â The servers are good. Â The food was bland. Â I went for breakfast. Â I ordered the omelette with potatoes and caramelized onions. Â There were cooked onions in it, but not caramelized onions. Â The tomatoes on the side were not fully cooked and underseasoned as well. Â I have not been to La Note in a few years, and had remembered it fondly. Â I will not be back."
105,This is a disgusting restaurant. I first wait in line for half an hour. Then what do I get. Over cooked pan fried potato. Duh! What is worst is that now I have diarrhea after eating at this place. I will NEVER come back.
106,"We came here to try to the Brioche Pain Perdu yet they were out. So I decided to order the Creme Fraische pancakes. They have absolutely no flavor at all! It pretty much tasted like I was eating plain dough. I sent them back and got them compt'd off the bill. When I wanted to order something else I was told by our server the kitchen was already closed. I work in the restaurant business as well and know the kitchen doesn't close until the last order is in no matter how long it is after we've closed. So I thought this was very unprofessional. Then after our server told us if we need anything he'd be sitting down and to go get him. What kind of service is that? I have to get up and get my server every time I have a question? I had a bite of some potatoes and the chicken sausage which was good. But overall, very disappointed with my experience."
107,"I'm not getting it. Â I fully expected to wait for the table, which we did. Â But not over 20 minutes to order. Â My latte was lukewarm when it arrived; cold by the time the food came. Â I go to brunch all over - this one was overpriced, even in the world of expensive brunches. Â $90+ for a 4 of us, no alcohol, and one of us drank only water? Â AND seriously, for these prices, serve real maple syrup. Â 2 stars for the waitress being very pleasant (if not slow) and my husband loved his french toast. Â Not worth a return trip."
108,"Eh.I was really excited to come here and sad to say that, although the food was ok, I'm not very happy.After being told to expect a 10-20 minute wait, we proceeded to wait an hour, in part because of the hostess passing us over, and once complaining, having to wait an additional 20 minutes for them to clear a table for 3 people.We were sat outside. It was a lovely day and the furniture is picturesque. I ordered the omelette de pommes de terre. decent, but bland. The salt shaker and ketchup were liberally used. My son ordered a oatmeal raspberry pancake, which earns 5 stars from me. My sister ordered a lemon gingerbread pancake, which neither of us loved, since the ginger was a bit overpowering leaving the pancake with a bitter aftertaste (maybe the lemon?). The best part of brunch?--the jam on the table. I would buy that jam. Hell, I might come back just for the jam."
109,"Went to get brunch at La Note today, the wait line was very long. It was a 45 minutes wait for eating inside and over an hour wait for the patio. Food wasn't that great. I think the pictures make the food look tastier than they really are. I got a hot chocolate and it was just your typical hot chocolate you can find at Target. Was disappointed, the hot chocolate wasn't anything special, it tasted bland. The food was at best decent, but not delicious. I had the lemon gingerbread pancakes with poached pears and blueberries. The presentation was fine. However, the pancakes were bland and dry. It was not moist enough, and didn't really taste that good. The poached pear was decent. The Mer...sausages Â was okay, wished they were more spicy. And home fries were good. Overall, just okay food not great food, and overall an okay experience. The patio in the back was cute and nice but, it loses it's nice atmosphere on a day when the whole patio is filled with people. I guess too many people makes it feel like you are in a crowded environment vs. a less crowded environment. Â The service was alright, not great."
110,"It's ok. Had the baguette and salami sandwich recommended by the waitress. It was just bread, salami, pickles and pickled onions. Nothing special. Rather expensive for $14 sandwich."
111,"After a long anticipated and courageous attempt to battle the weekend brunch crowd, I went in with a friend. Disclaimer: No French food extraordinaire but have lived in France and visited quite often with roots in French Louisiana and one thing I know if consistently agreed upon in food is ""la gout"" the flavor and taste trumps all. Not here to bash the place but lemon ginger pancakes came out tough and cold. Pain Perdu is done quite nicely, tomatoes provencale - meh, mascerated tomatoes came out without much flavor despite the gratious herbs atop.Omelette Jambon et Emmenthal- sufficient but not mind blowing... Overall, I found the aesthetics very cozy and French Village which is what they are going for. But we are here for the food first and foremost and found it paled in comparison especially on the flavor side of things...just pretty bland all around.If I go back will stick with Pain Perdu, seems to be a favorite and hard to mess up brioche french toast... that is a winner, otherwise I would adjust expectations to be mildly surprised if at all. Try their little cousin Cafe Clem for an morning pressed sandwich.. Now that I think is on point with a nice savory but light morning breakfast."
112,"This is a cute setting for a brunch, especially if you are seated on the patio. The food is good but not great. Since the wait here is long on a weekend, I would expect excellence and sadly I cannot say that anything was excellent. The pastries were good-not great. The service was distracted. Part of our meal was forgotten and it was difficult to find our waiter. When the item was delivered, it looked like it was also forgotten on the grill too. With so many options in the area, I wouldn't make a point to return to this location in the future."
113,"Sunday Brunch: Â Bad service, odd cramped table that wobbled. Food Â and coffee tepid not hot. We asked food runner for ketchup when he delivered our tepid food. He came back 10 minutes later with ketchup because he saw me at bus station trying to get some. By then food was cold. Definitely not worth the one hour wait for a table."
114,"The Charlotte for dessert was quite nice, Â and my generous lunch buddy's chocolate cake (she gave me a bite) was superb. But my Salade Nicoise was not good. First, there was simply way too much ""stuff"" Â just crammed into a little bowl. It was not easy to eat and seemed just messy and wrong. The corn, I swear to Diana, was canned, as were the beets. Awful. I did find the tuna, finally, at the bottom of the bowl. But it was a huge disappointment and needs a huge rehab and renovation. It's AOK, I think, to go totally conventional on the contents -- such as including green beans always, yes -- of Â this dish and put it on a platter or large plate, si vous plait."
115,"We arrived at 10:30am on Sunday for brunch, we were informed that it was a 30-40 minute wait. Since we were not in a rush on a cold rainy Sunday morning and we heard the food was delicious, we decided to wait along with the 12+ people on the wait list. The wait turned out to be 2 hours!!! We inquired several times about the wait and she reassured us 15 more minutes each time. I understand guesstimating the wait time, but 2 hours! The hostess did not have control - as our table was ready for us (she pointed to the table as it was being cleaned) another pushy patron & her friend sat down at the table and the hostess shrugged her shoulders, shook her head and DID NOT ask that patron to move, so we had to wait another 10 minutes for a table! The waitress was nice but it took her over 15 minutes to come take our orders, I had to get up and walk over to her at the bar area and ask if she was our waitress. She apologized and came over quickly. Once the food arrived, we were pleased with the yummy goodness! I had soft scrambled eggs with cream cheese over toasted levain bread which was perfectly done & delicious. Also had Brioche pain Perdu (french bread toast) and we thoroughly enjoyed and devoured. Â The 2 hour wait time was unbearable and just insane!! The hostess should guesstimate the wait time honestly so that we could decide whether to stay or leave and she should've handled the rude table stealing patron instead of having us wait. Therefore, this review is only 2 stars due to the insane waiting experience."
116,"I know everyone loves the Gingerbread Pancakes with Poached Pears but it just so wasn't for me. The poached pears were nice but the pancakes were SO DRY. I ordered 2, but you can order 1 or 3 as well. I didn't think it was worth the hype and the wait but I could have come on an off day. Looks nice in the picture though!"
117,The Egg Beatrice is really bad. They've put too much vinegar in it and I could hardly speak after finishing it.
118,"Waited more than an hour for a table and the food took 35 mins on top of that.Not impressed.This place is not worth the price or the waiting time, not to mention berkeley has so many other great brunch places that won't make you wait almost 2 hours to eat!"
119,"I give the one star for the beautiful patio. I cannot give a review on the food since my mom in law, myself, and my well behaved three year old daughter were never approached in the 30 minutes we sat there waiting. No one even came to take a beverage order or even refill our water glasses. We knew better than to go on a weekend so we decided to go on a Tuesday morning and we were seated outside immediately. However once we were seated we were completely ignored and I counted three tables of people who came in after us who received service. We were also sitting in the middle of the patio so there was no way you could miss us.It's a pity since I chose this restaurant based on all of the positive yelp reviews left by others. Also I would've sold my soul for the lemon gingerbread pancakes that received such rave reviews from other customers. Too bad so sad."
120,"Wow...such a disappointment...I was quite intrigued by the 1000+reviews, long lines outside, and things I've heard from friends and fellow Yelpers.I came here for Sunday brunch, around 10am, and the place was already packed, with loads of people outside. I was pretty pumped...after all, brunch is a serious business! :)It was only about a 30min wait. We got seated, and quickly ordered. I was looking forward to some amazing brunch food, but was soon let down.My girlfriend ordered their Lemon Gingerbread Pancakes and Poached Pears. I was in the mood for a more classic brunch, so I ordered their Les Oeufs Maison, with poached eggs and their chicken apple sausage.The pancakes were decent. They were a bit dry by themselves, and lightly spongy. Their Les Oeufs Maison were pretty mundane, especially for such a well-known place. I was happy they were able to serve poached eggs...but their ""aren't able to serve soft-boiled eggs?"" (noted on their menu.)The chicken apple sausages were pretty thin, with nothing notable. The homefries were OK, but I was amused how they cook them with garlic with the skin intact. I have never seen this at any restaurant...but did they forget to unskin the garlic? O.oI wasn't fully satisfied with La Note. My views weren't over-hyped before visiting, so I guess my disappointed was pretty unbiased. Personally, I prefer the other breakfast/brunch places in Berkeley - a lot better, sometimes cheaper, and more satisfying than the food at La Note.I don't think I'll ever find myself eating here again...still somewhat perplexed by why so many people come here. Is it because of hype? Maybe the French ambiance? Eh...if you really want to try, hopefully you can find something about La Note you like..."
121,"Doncha hate when the food is good but you have to take away stars for janky service? Since the food was good last time, we decided to go to breakfast here Sunday. We had a small group of moms & little girls. We knew there would be a wait but didn't realize how long since it wasn't that crowded..we put our name down and about an hour later were seated without explanation. It was pouring and apparently the waitstaff didn't think to consider the customers waiting outside, while there was space to sit and wait inside. The hostess reminded me of one of the sisters from sound of music, but less considerate. Not once person greeted us with so much as a hello or good morning. One waiter walked by and said You may want to put your name down! The kind of place where you immediate feel as though you've done something wrong. Ironically several other waiting customers were already talking about how rude the staff was, suggesting the 'tude was part of the French Country Charm. Tho the creme fresh pancakes are divine, they're not worth the 'tude on the side."
122,"From the month in advance reservation to the unfriendly service we received, everything seem like a one big joke. The parking was a joke, the wait was a joke, and our waitress was a joke. Although the interior was nice, the food was lacking in both flavor and substance. The mocha latte was bland and boring but on the upside it was a nice bowl. They also ran out of French toast which was why we came at all; no french toast from a brunch restaurant is pretty unbelievable. The ratatouille was a bit sour although it was definitely the best dish we ordered. The omelette was nothing special and the potatoes were just okay. Now that I think about it, this place was overpriced as well. This place definitely did not live up to its hype. Literally a month in advance reservation? Undeserved for this shit hole in the wall. Au revoir La Note, and may others see your flaws as have I."
123,"Terrible service from start to finish. La Note's sign in sheet allows you to indicate whether you want to eat inside, outside, or either. We put our name down for either. 45 minutes later, after multiple other parties that arrived after us were seated outside in advance of us, we went in to check on the status of our table. After telling the hostess our name and that we were willing to sit outside, we were told there were two parties ahead of us. Â Seconds later the hostess came outside and called three names. After seating these three parties, the hostess returned to the front of the building and told everyone waiting that she could seat anyone now in the back patio. We, of course, said we would sit outside.The hostess walked us to the back patio, along with patrons who had literally just arrived, and pointed at our table in the sun. She then pointed the patrons who had just arrived to a table in the shade. We were not given the option, nor were we walked to our table.20 minutes later and we were still waiting on our drinks. Â Food service was also extremely slow.I will not be coming back or recommending La Note to anyone."
124,"Don't really understand why this place has such a high rating...Came here for brunch one day and the wait was ridiculously long. By the time we were finally seated after more than an hour of waiting, I was already so hungry expecting to satisfy my hunger with some delicious food. But unfortunately the food was so disappointing :( We ordered the tartine with goat cheese and peppers, la ratatouille borghetti with merguez sausage, and pancakes. The tartine was pretty good, the peppers were very fresh but the goat cheese taste was a bit too strong...the ratatouille borghetti taste kinda strange idk how to explain, the sausages on the other hand, were not juicy at all...they were so hard and taste like those chinese sausages wth :O Lastly, the pancakes were decent, but not particularly outstanding.The noise level is kinda on the loud side. Service was fair and the decor is pretty cute. But overall I didn't think this place is that great."
125,"The Good: This place smells amazing, is very cute inside and has a great, sunny feel. We were immediately served cold water and fresh coffee and the noise level was not bad at all for how small the place is. The firs thing we ordered was the tartine mistral, which was fantastic- toasted to perfection, just enough goat cheese, fresh chopped basil. Wonderful. The veggies all seemed fresh and the yogurt was very tasty- possibly house-made, maybe just local. The Bad: After being seated and served coffee and water, we disappeared off the map somehow. Neither were refilled for 45 minutes. Checking in on Yelp is a marvelous tool to track service timing; any time you sit hungry and anxious seems longer than it is. Checking in when you sit down will help you gauge time accurately. So, yes, for 45 minutes we waited without water or coffee refills. We had ordered the tartine as the starter, but it arrived with our breakfasts and crowded the table. It was, however, too beautiful to refuse. My husband ordered the cote oeste, and found it light and engaging. I ordered the pommes de terre omelet, after numerous recommendations by other Yelpers, but found it sorely disappointing. The menu describes the onions as carmelized and the omelette as open-faced. This was served with undercooked onions in a folded omelette, which when filled with high-moisture onions and potatoes amounted to eggs folded around soup. The plate was somewhat redeemed by the tomatoes Provencale, but overall was a letdown. Overall: At this price point and level of quality, I expected both more attentive service and more attention to detail in preparation. I would have had better in both at Venus just up the street, which is where I will go next time. Would not recommend."
126,"La Note has been on my Yelp's bookmark for a really long time and you should have imagined my excitement when I actually had the opportunity to try it. However, that excitement quickly diminished...First off, I went on a Monday afternoon around 12pm. Even on a weekday, a supposedly ""few minutes"" wait for a table for two became more of a 10 to 15 mins wait. That didn't really piss me off Â because the weather was nice outside to wait...However, once inside, the tables were super crowded next to each other and I felt like the waitress forgot there were more than one table in the restaurant. We were waiting a long time to get our orders written down and then the wait for the food was excruciating. I think it was almost 25-30 minutes.The food was good (omelette with potatoes and caramelized onion), but for the price that we paid, the service should have been impeccable. Yes, their decor is cute and food is freshly made, but their service left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Never again, never again."
127,"I came here with Sumeena yesterday and was disgusted by the sheer lack of customer service displayed. I'm saddened as with such high Yelp reviews - you would think that the service would be amazing. I'm sorry to say I am not coming back here until these waitresses learn some manner. Unfrench, super unfrench."
128,"Really I'm a positive guy but felt I should clue you in.1. Â Hostess was sweet and nice but really inexperienced. Â Just wasn't sure what to do. Management should give her more training2. Â Came here for steak frites. Â No more steak. Â How can a French restaurant run out of steak frites?3. Â Waitress put on a good front but really knew nothing about French wine. Â The house red was lousy headache wine. Â We then took a half bottle which was a chinon that she claimed was deep like a Bordeaux. No it wasn't. Â It was a chinon. Light, thin and crisp for drinking outside on a hot summer day4. Â No steak frites so went for the pasta bolognase. Worst of my life. Â I swear it was tomato paste out of the can with parsley and cheese on top and some cooked hamburger. Zero flavor except for way too much tomatoWould not recommend!"
129,"The seafood puff pastry was bland and unremarkable. Â It was unseasoned and I could not taste any of the cheese sauce that the menu said was on it. Â I basically paid $17 for a piece of bread with some fish in the middle. Â The pastry wasn't particularly fluffy or flakey either, it was more like a calzone.Additionally the chardonnay that the waitress suggested tasted like Charles Shaw, not what I expected for $28."
130,"Let's just start with the atmosphere: it's a quaint and delicate little French-style restaurant with cute checker-lined chairs and lots of paintings on the walls. We were seated outside in the backyard garden with the beautiful scenery. The setting is absolutely charming. On the tables there were pots of raspberry jam, sugar cubes from France (both white and brown), and metal jugs of water; all of these were in containers with so much character I wanted to take them home.I am pretty sad that places like this get raving reviews and high popularity when other restaurants deserve the hype way more. The pancakes here are nothing special, a bit dry and rather flour-y in taste (I'd say even Denny's has better pancakes, though less original in terms of flavors). Points for interesting flavors. The french toast is literally two pieces of thick-cut toast pieced together with nutella (or whatever other filling you choose). No sweet, soft, moist bread slices filled with egg and milk; simply a piece of bread. That too, was very dry and one-dimensional in taste. The omelettes were better: home-style fries well prepared, but very oily. My cheese and ham omelette (omelette du fromage et jambon) tasted like something I could have made at home: eggs with a bunch of cheese and ham slices thrown in. No additional herbs or vegetables or any sort of seasoning that sets it apart from a regular omelette. Good but it needed lots of additional flavoring with ketchup and pepper.I really liked their raspberry jam though. Very delicious! And it comes in a cute little glass jar to complete the French setting. I would recommend getting a bread basket (assorted pastries) that has an assortment of French toast, banquettes, brioche, croissants. A layer of butter + a layer of jam = (fattening but who cares) LOVE.In all honesty, I think this place is overrated. With high prices and only decent-at-best food, La Note probably shouldn't be as glorified as it is."
131,"Went on a Sunday at 9:30 am expecting to get right in. 20 minute wait, we were told, with many people out on the street. We waited 50 minutes in the cold, because they were trying to set up the patio. It had just rained heavily the night before, why would anyone want to sit out on a cold, damp patio?Got our table, a small two-seater CRAMMED between the other two-tops. Spilled our drinks trying to sit down. The coffee we were given was lukewarm, asked for a new cup, also lukewarm. Ordered breakfast, took at least 30 more minutes (for pancakes! come on) and again, COLD. While waiting for the food, I had to go to the bathroom - only two lavatories, both were occupied easily for 10 minutes. That's not the restaurant's fault, but cramming too many tables in the place and only having two johns is. Called the server over, explained how unhappy we were. She said our meal was on us. The manager then came over and after our explanation, tried to only take off the pastry basket on our table (the cheapest thing and the one thing there was nothing wrong with). We said no, please take off all the cold food. They did, and were very kind to us, but frankly this place wasn't worth the hype. The little I did eat of the gingerbread lemon poached pear pancakes was gross - overly cakey, there was no lemon to speak of, and the pears were nasty, like they were canned. My husband's lamb sausage had a gamey taste to it. The coffee was bitter and lukewarm. In short, maybe dinner is better at this place, but for brunch - AVOID."
132,"If you can tolerate the rudeness of the woman who seats you, the food is quite good.However her arrogant attitude over shadows the food."
133,Really poor service. First the server didn't come for like 15 mins. Took the next 15 mins to get orange juice. Food took pretty long as well. The food was pretty good but the service spoiled it for me
134,I had heard a lot about this place and everyone said it was a best place for breakfast in Berkeley. But to be honest I couldn't see what all the fuss is about. We ordered two types of pancakes and the potato omelette and everything was just mediocre. The environment is pretty for sure. But there is not enough accommodations for Â the hot weather and everyone's sweating. The patio was not covered enough by trees (although we did visit around noon and sun was direct). The pancakes were dry and did not have enough cream on them and the omelette is tasteless too. I feel they should turn it into a museum. The food is not good
135,Their famed brioche pain perdu is fading....ordered recently and it was completely undercooked and soggy. Get one of their egg dishes.
136,"This place is way too overhyped and getting cocky, an hour and half wait and they don't wait 5 minutes for you. Â Unacceptable! Â So if you want to wait 2 hours for mediocre food, this is the place for you."
137,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!! First off they need a new system on handling customers instead of dump and run from a complaint. Second, do not tell a customer 45 min wait when its obvious that it is a 2 hour plus wait, taking only first names run into the risk of someone else taking the same name on the wait list. You have a 6 to 7 man kitchen crew, with over 40 tables of service(including patio)...it doesn't take a UC Berkeley grad student to figure it out. Whats worse instead of offering a coffee, water or juice they just tell you ""sorry we are busy"" and show you the door. As a patron of TEN YEARS!!!! I will NEVER go back to this place extremely poor service ...if this wasn't YELP, i would say excuse my French ^&*# off"
138,"Find a hair in my omelette today, never happen before( I always come here for brunch)... I'm kind of mad bec they only say sorry, no free drinks.... Very poor costumer service today... I find out in US the waiter don't really care bec their owner didn't teach them much about "" costumer service"" Â although the food is tasty but the costumer service should be equal important as how the food taste!!!!!!"
139,"This place is probably the most popular cute and quaint brunch hotspot for Cal students. This is the place to go if you really want to treat yourself after the eve of a drunken Saturday or to impress a new date. Their food is good, but I think La Note takes its status for granted by offering subpar service.My friend and I waited about an hour to sit, which is expected. We passed our time at Alexander's Books. When the maitre d' sat us, it was clear that she was in a rush and didn't have time to welcome us. Both my friend and I rehearsed our orders since they're in French and we didn't want to look dumb. When my food came out however, it was completely different from what I'd ordered -- I was given scrambled eggs with nothing in them. First I tried complaining to the maitre d' since she walked by, and she simply told me that she wasn't the one to talk to and that I should tell my waitress. When I brought this up to the waitress she insisted I'd said ""scrambled eggs"". I know I didn't say scrambled eggs because I'd been practicing my order, and even if it was mangled French, it wasn't ""scrambled eggs"". After what felt like an argumentative exchange, she finally conceded with ""well it's loud in here."" To appease me she brought me some goat cheese to eat with my plain scrambled eggs -- thanks but it's still not what I ordered.I think this place has it easy. It succeeds because it's renowned as a fancy, romantic, French brunch place and students buy into it. So La Note doesn't really have any incentive to offer quality service when students will arrive in hordes regardless.There are other brunch places near campus with even better food, service, and ambiance. My favorite is La Bateau Ivre. They serve an array of beverages, some even with a bit of whisky if that's your thing. Their ingredients are fresh, and they have a beautiful tree-shaded, street facing patio that's wonderful for people watching. Not to mention it's just south of Dwight on Telegraph."
140,"A very long wait (50 minutes). Although it was only halfway through brunch, they had run out of all pasteries by the time we were seated. We ordered omelets but recieved the wrong order. Since the server never returned to check on us for 15 min, we decided just to eat the food we hadn't ordered and leave."
141,"I am mainly giving La Note one star because One person in our party was running really late. When our table was ready they asked if our whole party was present. We said yes except one. Â They refused to seat us. Â I asked if they could go ahead and seat us so we could order AND we would order for our missing party as well. Â We were all pretty hungry after the long wait. They still refused. The hostess became rude after I asked what could be done so we could eat and have space for our missing party once she arrived. She offered no assistance. Â  So, I requested to be seated for 4 instead of 5 And we pulled a random chair over when my Missing party arrived. Â We ordered for her like we said we would. Â I'm okay with rules but you also have to be accommodating as well. Not everything is black and white. I always come for breakfast and I always leave 20 percent. You would think she wouldn't be rude knowing that!!!"
142,food is okay - low stars for what looks/sounds/feels like a default arrogance.
143,"Not sure how this place has almost five stars on trip advisor and four on yelp, it must be same people rating.This venue is cute, hostess is rude, and food was not as good as I was expecting. Â It is a bit overrated. Â For that kind of wait time I rather go to Liaison or La Fable."
144,"I had an aweful experience at la note recently. It used to be my favorite restaurant, but the quality of food and service have just gone down incredibly.Sure, the wait is long and i get that but our waitress took our order for drinks 45 min after sitting down, and then took our orders for food 40 min later.They didnt have coffee mugs and they ended up bringing it in dirty dishes.The food that they brought was both cold and burnt. I have no idea why our stupid waitress couldnt bring the burnt food before it got cold!! Even when we asked her about it!I was planning on not leaving tip but they automatically charged 18% tip for only 5 people!!!!It seems like they are very low on staff most of the times, and the staff are very incompetent.Im never going back to la note ever again!"
145,"I really want to give this place more stars, but I'm rating off overall experience and whether I'd come again. The good: food. Decent, fresh, and well prepared breakfast food. I ordered egg with a goat cheese filling topped with chives. All tasted good. The 2 star maker: 1 hour 15 minute wait outside and and another 45 for food. I don't care how popular these guys are but that's just unacceptable. I'll likely not return until they fix their operation"
146,"Is there a real purpose to why this place has a high rating? Â Because if there is, than I'm pretty much missing the target! Â Of course the staff was really friendly, the atmosphere was really crowded, and the seating was pretty close to one another. Â It all looked like signs of a great restaurant Â but then again when I read reviews like the ones I see on Yelp, I tend to get my hopes up. Â Luckily, we were seated as soon as we walked in. Â The tables were so close together that our waiter had to move tables around for us to get into the booth (that or, my purse would of knocked over everything off the table next to us). Â There are cute little pads on the wooden booths for those sitting on the hard wood, small pitchers of water to self serve, and a menu writing in French with English captions written under everything (Thankfully I went up to French Honors 3 in high school). Sad thing, I don't think any of the waiters spoke a lick of French. Â I ordered the lemon ginger bread pancakes with pears. Â Come to find out, I don't like ginger bread at all. Â My boyfriend ordered an omelet with onions and potatoes with some tomatoes. Â The best thing on his plate was the tomatoes. Â We also ordered the basket of sorted breads, which was really good. Â Maybe I ordered the wrong plate? Â Perhaps it just wasn't our cup of tea? Â But all I know, I've had better."
147,"Ok La Note, if you're going to allow OpenTable reservations, please remember to actually reserve a table and honor the reservations when people show up on time for them. Otherwise, there's really no point. That said, we made an online reservation and still had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a table (I don't think we were the only party that had to wait). We told the hostess we wanted to sit inside (it was a chilly morning) and she kept coaxing us to sit on the patio; she said it would be a longer wait for the inside (this was after we waited 15 minutes already). She told us to follow her outside to the patio to feel the heat lamps. I could see she was very desperate to get rid of us and we were all starving, so we gave in and agreed on the patio seating. The heat lamp, by the way, was very weak (there were only 2 in the entire patio). During our wait, some people without reservations came to check on their wait time and the hostess told them that because a lot of reservations showed up (she sounded so surprised...?) their wait time was increased. Sounds like they need some serious work on organizing those reservations.....So we ordered some pancakes, omelets and scrambled eggs and it took nearly 40 minutes for them to come out. I can wait 40 minutes for bomb-diggity food, but 40 minutes for mediocre food was a huge disappointment. 3 years later, I can conclude that La Note is overhyped. Â There are a TON of less-crowded eateries with much better tasting food. I do want to say that the wait staff has always been friendly and professional."
148,"How French is it to serve your omelettes with Tabasco and Heinz ketchup? After waiting like, 25 minutes, this was my thought when my food finally came. But hey, maybe they are just catering to the American custom. Then I took a bite of my potato and carmelized onion omelette.Sounds good right? Wrong. It was just one big pile of bland. No salt, no herbs (well, a sprinkle of parsley on top that didn't provide any real flavor) nothing that would earn the 4 stars on Yelp or the $12 they charged. Ah, that's why it came with ketchup and hot sauce. My husband got the ratatouille, which was much tastier and appropriately seasoned. I should've ordered that. In general, there isn't much here for a vegetarian to order --especially if you don't like goat cheese, like me. And there's pretty much nothing for a vegan, unless you want bread and lettuce, hold the cheese. So I don't understand all the love. This place is usually packed. Those people will say that I didn't order the right thing, maybe, or that I'm not French enough. I say, I'm saving my money for food that has flavor."
149,"This place is grossly over-priced. Service is lacking. And, if you don't order correctly, you can end up with bland food. Beware additions or changes to the menu, as they charge extra. Also, the plates are do crowded that you can't truly enjoy the meal: something I never really considered before. But my pancake, bacon, and eggs were all on top of each other and there was no room for anything."
150,"Had to wait to be seated. Plenty of open tables. Worker in saggy jeans on cell phone, standing around didn't acknowledge me. Â Worse still, exposed his buttocks and underwater. Â When he helped next customer, he offered a table right next to me when 15 other seats were available. He continued to take photos on cell phone and then sat down to eat. Then walked around with hands in pocket or leaned against counter or wall. Needed a lesson on greeting customers and general restaurant hospitality."
151,"I am so incredibly disappointed in La Note. Showed up at 10:30 am on a Sunday hoping for a relatively short wait for brunch. Because we were feeling pretty hungry, we were only willing to eat here if the wait wasn't too long. The hostess informed us that a table would be ready in about 30 to 40 minutes, which wasn't bad at all. We lingered around for a bit and checked in with her after half an hour, which is when she informed us that it would be about 20 more minutes. Okay, not too bad and it's still pretty close to the original estimate she gave us. After waiting another 30 minutes (an hour in total at this point) to no avail, we asked for a new estimated wait time. The hostess responded it would be another 20 minutes, but insisted that she could not give a definitive answer because her answer was merely ""her best estimate."" I looked at the list of tables still waiting, and there were at least 5 more tables ahead of us. Given the small size of the restaurant, I was highly skeptical that those 5+ tables would have been seated within her new ""best estimate"" of 20 minutes. We became so frustrated with their horrible service that we left at noon. So long story short, La Note made us wait for over DOUBLE Â the time of what they had originally estimated, and we still weren't able to get a table. It's not the long wait times that is making me give them such a low rating (I've been here before and I understand that they're a busy restaurant), but it's their complete and utter incompetence in estimating wait times. This kind of service and practice comes off as extremely deceitful and almost cruel - incorrectly estimating wait times over and over again to make your restaurant go-er wait an inexplicably long time. Had I known that the wait time would be an hour and a half, I would have gone somewhere else. Instead, we stood outside the restaurant and wasted a good chunk of our morning waiting for nothing. Throughout this whole process, the hostess was thoroughly unapologetic and curt. When I checked in with her the first time, she said ""You've been here for about 30 minutes, so it'll be another 20 minutes."" I'm not sure why she talked to us so condescendingly, as I was asking her about wait times and not how to do math. I especially disliked how she would say things along the lines of ""Well, this wait time is what it looks like to me and it's the best I can do."" If that were really true, someone definitely is not doing their job right.Considering that I did not even eat at this restaurant, I unfortunately cannot give them anything more than 1 star. In fact, 1 star is quite a generous rating seeing as they not only didn't provide any value, but they actually took away our time. Coming to this establishment incurred a net loss due to their vast underestimates of wait times.I almost never give 1 star reviews. Regardless of how terrible a restaurant's food may be, I still only reserve 1 stars for those that I believe are deceitful and dishonest. After this infuriating experience, La Note definitely makes the cut."
152,"Great food, really great food. Horrible service and long waits. Waiters ignore you and watch you die of starvation. Then, they are reluctant to take your money and give the change back."
153,"The wait for brunch was insane (about an hr wait), it took them forever to get our orders in and get our food...as in another hour to get the food.I got their brioche pain perdu, which was good but nothing spectacular. Their raspberry oatmeal pancake was interesting but bit too dry, and I had to put lots of butter on it.Eggs are well done, but it wasn't anything I couldn't get at any other breakfast place. Overall, the experience was a bit disappointing."
154,"Disappointed in the service, waiting 30 minutes on a Monday after the lunch rush to order, waiter was not very apologetic.I was really unhappy with my last visit. Â It was a while since I have been here but I never experienced bad service as this. I brought my mother on her visit because the last time we came she really enjoyed it. Â We waited over half and hour just to order. Â It was busy on the patio although I noticed other patrons being helped before us when they arrived after we did. Â I had to walk up to the busboy to try and get someone to take our order and he was pretty sarcastic to me about the situation. Â 10 minutes later, the waitress finally came and said sorry under her breath, lacking any sincerity. Â After we ordered we never saw our waitress again until the bill came. Â We received more attention from the runner's than we did from our waitress. To top it off the food was mediocre. Â Unfortunately, La Note doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be."
155,"I recently ventured in to La Note, was excited about having the Lemon ginger pancakes. I was quite disappointed with a flat cardboard taste. They were dry and I thought I coil revive them at home, know way.I believe the poach pears to be canned and tasteless.Overall I was disappointed but I guess I'll have to do a recheck in the future?Two stars are for table service."
156,"If you have 2 and 1/2 hours to spare for breakfast and you appreciate an indifferent staff, this is your place. After waiting over an hour and a half I checked in with the hostess who had apparently lost track of our name on the list. We were finally offered outdoor seating which we reluctantly accepted in spite of the fact it was a cold breezy day. We were seated near an area heater which wasn't working. We suggested to the staff that the propane tank was possibly empty, but we were rebuffed. Noticing there several full propane tanks at the base of the heater we asked again if they might be willing to change the tank and a staff member finally relented to the relief of the many other shivering patrons seated in our vicinity.It's really tough to enjoy your breakfast when you are uncomfortably cold.The food was pretty good but the careless and inattentive staff made our meal an experience to be endured, rather than enjoyed."
157,"Very inconsistent -- I've been here at least 5 times. The last time will probably be the last -- we ordered the basket of pastries, and they just sucked. Cold, not good... comparable to pastries in a mediocre coffee shop. Very cute interior and patio, very nice-sounding menu -- but the cooking just isn't consistent enough to make me want to try my luck again."
158,"Be careful to go on a Sunday morning people! First I want to say that I like their house potato comes with your meal, it has roast garlic in it which is very tasty, but everything else I had was just regular. The potato is the reason I want to go back from I went there almost a year and half ago for the first time.BUT I would NOT go back and the reason I don't recommend this place is because you may need to wait as long as the people after you to FINISH their food before you get yours and no one will even apologize genuinely about. We ended up just wrap everything and go cuz we need to go to our appointment! Won't go back again not only because this bad experience but also their limited menu. There are tons of brunch place you can find all over the bay!"
159,"Being that this was totally raved on yelp, I have decided to give it a try. The wait can be long, but why not wait and see. I ended up ordering the Cote sud, which consisted of what I believe was lamb sausage, sunny side up egg, and potatoes. I didn't like the sausage at all, it was way to gamy to eat in the morning and didn't go well with all the other food. Very overwhelming!!!"
160,"I don't know...I am not a fan of eating brunch outside like cool hipster ppl do. So basically you pay 10+ dollars for eggs and bacon and like a piece of toast. I don't know man...not my thing. And I'm not giving one star only because I hate the idea of brunching outside. Their food wasn't that great. I mean who can fail eggs and toast...even I can make them great. My sausages tasted weird...I couldn't eat it so my roomie tried to eat it for me...and she's good at eating weird food but even she didn't like it. And their pancake was just okay. After few bites, it gets boring, feel like it's choking me in the throat so I wash it down with water.I D K maybe I'm not a brunch person :/Oh and this girl next to us kept farting or something...we were freaked out thinking that the smell was coming from their homemade?! jam. But it was the girl."
161,"Came for brunch on a Sunday. Was told the wait would be 45 minutes. The wait kept being 45 minutes for the next hour and a half. Once we got in the atmosphere was lovely, but the service was really poor and the food was fine but certainly not worth the combination of price and wait time."
162,"I would have liked to have given this place a higher rating, as the food is tasty, butnot worth the long wait it took to get a table, and the lack of good service that followedthe wait. Was bummed out when I saw people that arrived later than me, get theirorder in before I did, and was turned down about placing my order to go, as they were to busy to prep it.Rare restaurant experience."
163,"I had never been to La Note until my 38th birthday, even though I've lived in Berkeley for most of my life. Â I gathered a small group of 4 and went for brunch. Â I will say it was busy on the weekend, and we had to wait for about 45 minutes. Â They dont take reservations, during busy times. Â I got french toast, Brioche Pain Perdu so did one of my guests, another got the Ratatouille, and I dont remember what the other person had, maybe pancakes?! Â I wasn't impressed at all. Â In fact disappointed! Â The french toast was a combination of soggy and dry. Â I can make better french toast. Â I really expected greatness because of all the good reviews, and how long it has been around, but instead I got a bad birthday brunch!"
164,"Nice place, but VERY unorganized didn't have anyone taking names to be seated then was skipped all together even though I wrote my name in the list. Didn't get sat for an hour and a half. Very rude staff. Can't say the food was good walked out because of the long wait"
165,"I rarely post a bad review - but last nights dinner was truly an all-time low. We got there at 9 PM and at least a third of what we all wanted to order was no longer being served. The food was overcooked and hastily prepared, and the service even worse! My soup tasted like dishwater was sent back, as was my main course - it's hard to ruin a nicoise salad and yet the tuna was so overly peppered and so dry and overcooked it was an edible. The vegetables were not fresh and it was packed in a small little bowl. Nothing about it was tempting or tasty. The waitress argued with me and then said there was nothing left to serve in the kitchen because they were closing and the ravioli she said I could order she then came back and said someone in the kitchen was going to eat that last order - so I ate nothing! This is the second disappointing meal we have had at this restaurant which is very conveniently placed when you go to the movies on Shaddick. Anything would've been better, and by the way it was very expensive! It was impossible to get the waitresses attention and really I can't imagine or remember worst service or food. The only plus is the ambulance... But that's just not enough."
166,"I used to like this place. It was right next to my apartment in downtown Berkeley, so I used to go there a lot for Sunday brunch. It is all in past tense because I don't go there anymore. Why? Â Where do I start?The Menu: It always has been limited, as far as I can remember. They used to make just a few things, but made them well. Now they still make just a few things, but they are more expensive and no longer made well. They had this strawberry jam they gave you for your toast.Last time I had it it was rotten. You could tell that it has been passed from table to table, where various people has stuck their spoons in it, and you just hope they didn't lick them. It is disgusting!The ambiance: The place is too small, loud, and the tables and the chairs are uncomfortable. The patio was nice. I don't know if they still serve there.The Service: On Sundays, long, long wait at the door just to get in and been squeezed Â at a tiny table, sitting on a prickly chair while waiting forever to order. I had to waive for 30 min. to get a waiter to refill my water. If you drop a fork on the dirty floor, well you better pick it up, or eat with your fingers, because it won't be replaced anytime soon.My last dining experience there was so annoying, that I decided I'd never go back. I am sure other customers have had the same bad experience. It is no wonder they have to advertise so heavily - Â to lure in new victims.Don't be a new victim."
167,"LONG WAIT, MEDIOCRE SERVICE AND OBLIGATORY 18% TIPIn our group of five there were some good dishes ordered: bouillabaise (shellfish soup) and seafood ""empanada"" Â The specialty chicken wasn't special and the pork roll was dry. Â The salade niÃ§oise was good and serves 4 people.The deserts were not as good as we had expected. (Get your desert elsewhere.) Â The wait was 45 minutes with a reservation! Â The unsmiling waitress was only attentive to serving our water and bread. Considering the blah service, the mandatory 18% tip made the restaurant more overpriced that it already is.With five or more at your table all your separate tabs will have an 18% TIP FORCED upon you -even with mediocre service! Â I won't be going back with so many other restaurants to chose from in Berkeley..."
168,"The food is not worth the wait. I was there for a Sunday lunch. I got a sandwich with grilled chicken which was good but not special at all. We were in 4 and we waited almost 1.5 hours. First, we were in line for almost 45 minutes and then after we were seated we waited more than half an hour. I know that we chose to go there and I understand that you have to wait because everybody wants to go there. So I accept to wait outside but after being seated I would like to wait a reasonable time. Long waiting time means that a restaurant is not properly managed. Â  Moreover I found the staff very rude and not really able to handle a busy situation. Â I don't think I give them a second chance."
169,"DO NOT HAVE YOUR SPECIAL EVENT HERE! I have been to La Note many times over the years, and taken out of town visitors there. I will NEVER go back, or recommend any one go there, until I get a personal response from the owner for the HORRIBLE service I received there.I was planning my bf's celebration for graduating with his PhD from UC Berkeley. I figured La Note was the perfect place with their adorable back patio. Service there has been spotty before but I was able to overlook that for yummy french toast. So, I made special reservations 2 months in advance. I had to reserve a pre fixe menu since we would be a party of 8 (had family flying in from Wisconsin just for this).So, we show up on graduation day for our brunch and are seated outside at a respectably cute table. However, we are informed that the bathroom is broken and we cannot use it. Gross! How is the staff washing their hands? Also, we have a 3 year old with us. They told us to go next door to Thalassa (the pool hall and bar) and use their bathroom. So I run next door and am turned away because I don't have my ID. It's 12 pm on a Saturday! Whatever, I go back to the restaurant and get my license. But now they won't let the 3 year old in to use the bathroom because he's not 21!! Well, why did La Note send us here?? We end up wandering the street looking for another business that will let a little boy use the bathroom.Back to the restaurant AGAIN...while I was trying to find a working bathroom, our waiter has given menus to our entire party. However, it is the WRONG menu (not the one I reserved). He has also NOT explained to my out of town family that it is a pre fixe menu and that certain drinks are not included in the cost. So, my family had all ordered mochas. When I told them this cost extra, they wanted to cancel their drinks.I go looking for our waiter and ask him to please cancel the drinks since they were not made yet. He told me ""that's a lot of espresso for the kitchen to waste"". We hadn't even gotten our drinks yet??!! I explained that he had not told my guests the menu was pre fixe and he responded ""It's written write there"". Are you kidding me?! What kind of service is that? Half the menu is in French! I ask to speak to a manager. Waiter says ""he'll be right back"".Well, he didn't cancel our mochas, he didn't get the manager, and we ended up paying extra for all those drinks. I asked a different server to inquire why we weren't given the correct menu and was told ""I don't know anything about that"".Seriously, this is not the kind of service I expect on a brunch that is costing $250++I also gave the server my credit card before we were seated, and asked him not to present a check to the table. Well, when it came time to pay he let one of my other guests pay even though I'd already given him my card! Ugh. The whole experience ruined graduation day. DO NOT HAVE YOUR SPECIAL EVENT HERE!!!!!I will recommend to everyone I know not to visit La Note unless they wanted to be treated with disrespect and taken advantage of. And, if you're our waiter with the long braids, you're a jerk!! And we still tipped 20%!!"
170,"One time I was in line at La Note* Â and Sean Penn the actor stopped by. Â  He saw how long the line was and left. Â  So far so good. The hostess, upon hearing the news from some gushing Penn fan, said ""Why didn't anyone tell me, we would always make room for Seaannnnn"" (she said it like *that*). I asked her, ""Really? Â You'd ignore this line of people to seat someone just because they're famous?"" Â ""Of course!"", she replied.That's the last time I went to La Note, and that was 13 years ago. Â Betcha Sean Penn realized it was a dump with high prices and doesn't go there anymore either.* Just a Note for visitors to La Note: Â Most time you spend there will be in line. Â The remainder will be spent waiting for coffee."
171,"Not a great experience today. Took about 45 min for food to arrive, then got my order wrong (wrong dish). Waited another 15 min for correct dish while rest ate. My dad asked for jam to go with pastry basket and got charged $1.50 for it. For real?"
172,"As of yet, I can't even rate the food here, because we haven't gotten it yet. Â In fact, we've been here for 2 hours, and have not even gotten our drinks yet. Â In the time I've waited here, I could have cooked myself breakfast and lunch, and eaten them too. Â I would not recommend anyone to come here unless they have 3 to 4 hours to kill. Â The menu isn't even very extensive and is very limited. Â And the staff does not even show any concern for the fact that we should have eaten and left an hour ago, and when specifically addressed by me, they presented the excuse that they were busy. Â I'm writing this review because I have nothing else to do with the time I've wasted here. Â The lack of courtesy and decent service constitutes my complaints about this place. Â Never come here unless you have an uncanny amount of patience."
173,"They don't take reservations but the wait wasn't so bad because we were willing to sit outside. Â The day started off chilly so everyone was ordering coffee or mochas. Â I wanted to skip the caffeine but didn't want the ice water either so I asked for hot water instead. Â The pain perdu (french toast), lemon gingerbread pancakes and rosemary garlic home fries were nothing to rave about. Â The cote nord was interesting since I never had scrambled eggs with cream cheese before. Â At this point they were at 2-3 stars and then the bill came. Â $0.75 for hot tap water! Â The server should have warned me when I asked for the water and I should asked if there was going to be a charge.NOTE: 18% service charge on parties of 5 or more."
174,Mind you - this is for DINNERDinner was so-so. The wines are sub par and the prices are at a premium. The service is good as always but the dinner is not as good as the breakfast.
175,"I came here with my friends for some breakfast food. Â It took some time to be seated. Â They are supposed to have fresh jam. Â I didn't really taste the difference.Everytime we asked for anything it took days to get it over to our table. Â Not that the waitress was rude, but I just couldn't understand why every single part of the meal took forever.As a whole, the wait time trumps any stars they would have gotten for the quality of food. Â I can't even remember the food."
176,"Had a Sunday brunch and the place was crowed, Â But after a short wait, we were seated in a lovely back patio and received excellent service. Â  Unfortunately, the food was quite poorly prepared. Â  Several of us ordered their specialty pancakes, and all were under cooked. Â  If you go, stay with ordinary items breakfast items like eggs and potatoes, and forget the pancakes."
177,"We went around 2pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all but as someone before me pointed out that's just the tip of the iceberg. We ordered their bread basket which was nothing special, although we did keep the honey and apricot jam they gave us. I was expecting more for $7. It took 30 minutes after we ordered for the bread to get there! I could not believe it- it is not hard to put a croissant, a piece of cinnamon bread, and 4 slices of french bread in a basket. Twenty minutes later we got our sandwiches which were a major disappointment. The cheese was very weak- easily overpowered by the sundried tomato or the (supermarket deli) ham. For $12 it could have at least been toasted and had better quality ingredients. It was accompanied by a bitter greens salad with next to no dressing. The only plus was that they left pitchers of water on our table so we had plenty to drink. A $50 lunch (for 3 people w/ no drinks) that could easily have been reproduced at a supermarket for probably $15. Too high prices, lousy parking, and terrible service - I definitely would not recommend this restaurant."
178,"I'm almost sad to say I can't like the place. Â I don't want to offend the enthusiastic reviewers who gave La Note five stars. Â I don't want to offend the waitstaff who seemed decent enough, heck, I don't even want to offend the kitchen staff who might have been the cause of our suffering, at the end, life is short so why make it difficult for others, right? Â  Well, our experience at La Note was not exactly at high point. Â We arrived at 2 pm, got seated right away, ordered, and our drinks arrived in decent time. Â Then we watched people with plates of food zipped by us. Â I gave up recalling how many times I told myself this must be ours. Â My daughter asked me how long it takes to make a pancake. Â I tried explaining to her the process in a restaurant, then I called upon her patience. Â After a while, even that stopped making sense because I myself lost my patience. Â At 2:47 pm, I asked another waitstaff to check our order, and a little past 2:50 pm, our waitstaff appeared with our foods. Â Thank God because I was this close to just leave hungry!Whatever satisfaction we might have gotten from our foods was unfortunately deeply discounted by the unreasonable long wait. Â What was going on in the kitchen? Â Did our order slip through a crack? Â Who knows and as I'm writing this, I don't care because I won't come back. Â The creme fraiche was good and the omelette with cheese and jambon was good. Â The baguette with spicy lamb sausage was overrated and overpriced, I don't know why it was raved about. Â As we almost finished our foods, the second waitstaff came to check if we were waiting for anything. Â I reminded her that I asked her to add the coffee cake to our order earlier, but also told her never mind if she had not done so. Â She said ""it has not been done"" (??? the kitchen had not started on it yet or my request was forgotten??). Â I was almost happy for the first time during that meal, because I did not want to spend another dollar there. Â She said ""Sorry"" and I wanted to say: Â ""I'm sorry too, my dear"".Adieu La Note! Â There will always be Paris and if that is far, Dottie's True Blue in SF."
179,"OMGHow did La Note get mostly 4-5 stars reviews is beyond me. Â 30 mins. wait for a table, 20 mins. wait for a croissant, another 20 mins. wait for the brioche toasts, another 10 mins. for a fried egg, and another 10 mins. for an omelet. Â I think this was completely insane. Â Moreover, the food came out barely warm and the hot chocolate was runny. Â How could this place get 4 stars I have no clue. Â Perhaps the only explanation is there's no other breakfast brunch place nearby. Â Folks, believe me, it's not worth the wait for this quality of food. Â Being a picky eater, I have to honestly tell you Stack or IHOP fare much better than La Note. Â Do yourself a favor and save your money."
180,"Was excited to try this place, but it was disappointing. The food was good, but not worth the hour+ wait. And I don't mean an hour for a table, we were sat promptly, waited 20 min for our server to decide she had time for us, and another 45+ min for our food to arrive. And the place wasn't even full. Our server spoke to us twice, once to take the order once to drop the check. We were there over an hour and a half..... for breakfast. About 15 min of which was spend actually eating food. I'm usually a 20-25%+ tipper but she got 10% and didn't even deserve that. Will not return."
181,"Wow, I really wasn't expecting to be so sorely disappointed from brunch here the second time around. Â I wanted to give them another shot and sample their other dishes after getting such a good impression the first time, but the food was mediocre at best overall.-Bread basket: delicious brioche bread, but sub-par baguettes that were very tough to chew.-Oatmeal Raspberry Pancakes: nice, fluffy texture and matched well with the raspberry compote.-Omelette de Pommes de Terre: W.T.F. Â This was by far the WORST OMELETTE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Â All you could taste was starchiness from the potatoes and there was no flavor to be found anywhere amongst those, the caramelized onions, or the eggs themselves. Â Don't even get me started on the sogginess or the dryness of the eggs. Â I took two bites and couldn't for the life of me get myself to eat anymore. Â A cheap diner omelette at half the price would've blown this pile of garbage out of the water.As for the service, our waiter was nice enough but forgot my coffee (which was also extremely average). Â I can safely say now that La Note is far over-hyped with seriously hit-or-miss food and high prices. Â Won't be coming here again."
182,"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!My girlfriend and I waited for 25 mins, not even a glass of water!!!!!!The waitress are kind of slow and not very smart.The food are average. Nothing impressive, way over price.Even IHOP has better pancake.I would NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone."
183,"Not particularly memorable atmosphere, food, or service. The bread seemed day old at best, the ratatouille could have easily been reheated from a frozen bulk shipment, and what was listed as bÃ©chamel on the croque monsieur tasted as if it was made with water instead of milk (or cream as the most decadent will attempt). Desserts seemed beyond the capability of the kitchen as even a coffee was weak and only after asking, were we given sugar and cream accompaniments. Truly wish it was better and will try again just to be sure it wasn't some aberration in this seeming Berkeley institution for french cuisine."
184,"I'll explain my star system here:1 star - Went running out before meal was over2 stars - Not worth a return visit3 stars - Not bad. Â Some good dishes but not hitting on all cylinders4 stars - Very Good! Â A winner in its class and category. Â 5 stars Â - Outstanding!! Â A true winner. Â A go-to place for a fabulous meal. Â Never a bad meal.So, why La Note fell flat and not worth a return visit. Â Nothing personal but just not at all worth it. Â Ferguson and I went for brekky today. Â He had eggs over easy with bacon and toast, I had scrambled eggs over toast with grilled tomatoes. Â Both came with taters.What worked. Â My eggs were nice. Â  Service was good and friendly.What didn't - Taters are my pet peeve. Â Good ones are moist and creamy inside, crispy outside. Â Oh, and warm to hot in temperature. Â Not many places can do this. Â Takes a lot of time and grill space to do right. Â La Note certainly didn't. Â Theirs were luke warm to cool inside, slightly underdone and crunchy with a deceptive looking carmelization on the outside. Â No seasoning except for some mildewy tasting rosemary (anyone else think that rosemary at times tastes more of mildew than rosemary?). Â Ferguson's over easy eggs were cold, his bread more wondery than acme-e. Â What else can you say? Â His bacon was cooked.Everyone loves a great breakfast place, and this certainly has the looks of one. Â Rustic setting with squeaky floors, tattooed waitresses with wingtip/ Far Side eyeglasses, etc. Â  However, the execution falls flat and sadly is not worth a return visit. Â When I pay $30 for two of us I certainly hope that it beats $10 for two at McDonald's. Â This place didn't."
185,"Food was pretty good. Poor ambience indoors though outside is great. Other than that, service was extremely slow even though there were plenty of empty seats and spaces. Food took forever to come. Â Almost got charged more than what we ordered. Bad experience."
186,"Overpriced for food that definitely is not worth writing about. $15 for one pancake (that was too dry), scrambled eggs, and potatoes? No thanks."
187,"Beautiful courtyard, pleasant but crowded interior. Â We made a reservation for a party of 6 for my wife's Birthday, and were seated in a charming corner table under what appeared to be a fruiting fig tree.After placing our drink orders (how does a French restaurant not serve French press coffee?),we placed our food orders and waited nearly an hour before we were served our food. Â Some of our friends had to put their food in to-go containers because it was already 11:45, and we'd been seated at 10:30. Â The food was warm, not hot, and the waitstaff had more attitude than competence. Â When I complained to a server, he said that ""it's not my problem!"", and slammed a plate of food down in front of my wife! When we complained to our waitress, she had nothing but technical excuses and no compensation whatsoever; ""feel free to talk to my manager"" was her response. Of course, said manager had just left the premises. Go for the location, but don't expect hot food any time soon or friendly service."
188,"Just got back from brunch. Here are the details:The good: The cinnamon broiche was amazing. The meh: The homefries were charred. Not deliciously golden, but truly burnt and pretty gross. The rest of the food was not amazing either; greasy eggs, dry pancakes, etc.The bad: 1.I know estimating wait times is difficult, especially during hectic weekend brunch, but please don't tell us we'll be waiting 30 minutes when we will actually end up waiting over an hour. Ridiculous. 2. Even more ridiculous: getting to our table and having to wait another 20 minutes before the server even noticed we existed.Overall, if you must go, try to go at a time when they won't be as busy. And whenever you go, expect painfully slow and inattentive service"
189,Where to start?! First we waited 30 minutes to be seated to then have to wait an additional hour or so to get our food because they lost our order! Our waiter was a complete dumbass we kept asking for water and coffee and he never remembered. Another waitress kept having to serve us. Then after we finished our food it took just as long to flag down that same dumbass waiter so we could get the hell out of the restaurant. The food was mediocre so the long wait was even worst! As many times as we asked for different waiters to check on our food no one gave a shit. Will never come back to this place EVER!!! We came in for brunch and 1pm and we are barely leaving now at 3:40 pm. Just waiting to sign so I can leave this place! Worst brunch ever!!!!! And he fucked up splitting the bill just now. The end! Done with this place.
190,"Went for brunch and ordered the cote est meal with a creme fraiche pancake and home fries. Â I was really surprise at how ""meh"" it was. Â At $12.50, I would have rather gone to a diner for better food at a cheaper price. Â I prefer Crepevine on Shattuck to La Note any day."
191,"Where to begin. This place is really hit or miss; most days, the food is great, service is unremarkable (sometimes friendlier, sometimes with more attitude) but today crossed the line. We specified an outdoor seat but we were sat down indoors; since we had been waiting so long we decided to settle. We didn't receive menus until we asked someone else about 5 minutes later, it took another 10 before our waitress took our order and then we waited probably half an hour or more before another group of waiters brought us the food. We also had to flag down someone else to get coffee because our waitress was nowhere to be seen. In the end, two of the dishes were messed up (had a substitution request that wasn't fulfilled) but worst of all, the Pain Perdue, normally delicious, was dry and bland. We saw our original waitress maybe 3 times throughout the while brunch. We were sitting inside and there were open tables all around us, so the place was not busy. Worst brunch ever. Won't be going back for a while."
192,"Ordered the lemon gingerbread pancakes, and after 30 minutes of waiting it was an utter disappointment. Pancakes had a rubbery texture with no lemon flavour at all. Not worth a combined hour wait ):( The omelette/egg dishes looked decent but im not sure ill be willing to come back to try them. If u have a sweet tooth for breakfast, skip this place"
193,"Not too sure what people see in this restaurant. Coming from Portland where we tout amazing brunch places, I was excited to try one in Berkeley. My friend and I came here around 11 and found the place to be jammed packed. We were, however, sitted quickly since we volunteered to sit at the outside patio.The biggest complain I have about this place is that my food came out COLD. VERY COLD. Who the hell wants to eat a lukewarm pancakes and scrambled eggs. Who?! I wanted to stand up, take my plate, walk over to the kitchen, and ask the chef to try my food to prove my point. I hate eating lukewarm brunch meals especially when I have to pay $20 for it. I held back my anger and ate my meal with a hint of salty attitude. Also, my food tasted OK. I tasted way better concoction of awesomeness in Portland."
194,"I did like some of the food but the service was horrible! Â This rating is for the service! Â I've been wanting to try this place for some time and as the other yelpers mentioned Sunday brunch gets busy, so I got there a little before 9 the hostess, is the most friendly and attentive of all, this is sad! Â We waited about an hour because they don't start until the whole party is present and some of my friends were late, we did have a group of 5. Â We finally got seated and we were Soo busy catching up, we didn't realize a half an hour had passed and NO one came to see if we wanted to stay off work drinks or anything! Â There was a waitress I was able to get eye contact with but she blatantly ignored us multiple times, we finally had to flag down the busser to find our waitress, he asked the other waitress that ignored us, whose table it was. Â When she showed up, I was upset because she had been in the dining area the whole time, she wasn't apologetic or anything! Â Once we place our order and she brought our food, we barely see her. Â Because of the server this place is definitely not worth it! Â Cote nord with cream cheese was delightful, the eggs are perfectly not over cooked and worked well together, wouldn't have thought the combination works, but it is delicious! Â The omelette with ratatouille was more of a disappointment, the omelette was over cooked, not even slightly runny, definitely not French style! Â We also ordered lemon ginger pancakes, agree with the other post, barely taste the lemon, the ginger was over powering, it was ok, not much to tell. Â If the rating was just on food, I'd say 3 stars, but service takes it down, I'd leave no stars if possible!"
195,"Good portions, potatoes were really good. Eggs were decent. But that's really it. I just gotta say that our server was ridiculous, though. My girlfriend and I came at a slow time, yet she took so long to take our orders and was rude while at it. Probably having a bad day, but I've worked in food, too. Also, she was being weird when we asked for warm milk... I don't know. It was just a strange interaction, and I felt pretty judged. Her attitude wasn't good at all, hence the 2 stars. I wouldn't wait for this place, but you could give it a try just to try."
196,"I went here for brunch.I ordered a mocha. It was alright. Needed to be hotter... a little watery even?Ordered a tartine (french baguette with butter and jam). It was the highlight of the meal. I don't know if that's a good thing.For the main, I had the pain perdu (aka french toast). It's made with challah bread and has a orange-y ness to it. It's very subtle. I haven't decided if I like the orange flavor. The dish itself was very light and lacked flavor. I felt like I was better off just ordering the tartine. I've been wanting to go here because I've heard great things about this place but...it's overrated!! The wait is ridiculous. We waited over an hour (stopped keeping track after the 60m mark) for a table of four."
197,"I was there this weekend with some friends. The wait was not too bad. Â I did have to flag someone down about 20 minutes after ordering to plead for some drinks. Â All of us enjoyed our food. But really the service was just horrible! Â I might be more understanding if the place was packed but there were 5 empty tables. Â Anyway the waitress was reallly reallly bad. She was a horrible representation of what I am sure the owners want the world to see. Everything about her screamed that she hated her job and that she did not give a darn about the customers. Â We were so insulted by her behavior that I wanted to find a manager to express my concern. However my friends needed to leave so we did not. If based on food and drinks, I would give it a solid 4 stars. However there is no food worth such terrible treatment. Â  Oh and just a note we were four women, all well dressed, we all ordered a drink and entree. We were not there to waste her time!If you do decide to give this place a try... You will like the food and I pray that you will have better service! Â Good luck!"
198,"Disappointing Dinner Experience. Other than the romanic french ambience, this restaurant left me apologizing to my guest the blandness of every dish from soup to dessert. I can appreciate undersalted food but the flavorlessness of the bouillabaisse with its desiccated vegetable pieces left me bewildered at how this restaurant received over 1000 reviews on yelp with an average of 4 stars. Even the bread pudding was bland, drizzled chocolate with high amount of cocoa butter but lack of cocoa and sugar left much to be desired. However, most reviews on yelp were for brunch but I am not sure whether it is worth the risk."
199,The food was quite pricy than what we thought. Do not come here on a budget or with big parties. Food was decent. They add a large service charge and let's not forget the tip they asked for.
200,"If I can give this place no stars I would. There service was incredibly ridiculous. We came with a table of 7, they told us it was 40 minute so we decided sure why not, we can wait. Nearly 2 hours later, we were still not seated! There was a huge turnover of people coming in and out and we were still not seated. The women who were work there were so rude and totally inattentive to us. When we Â approached them with a very polite manner and asked them how much more time do we have to wait; they told us that they we're not able to help us because there was a party seated for nearly a half hour without even paying for their check. And their check was not even given to them, until someone from my party asked if they had a check drop. Basically fuck this place! And their shity service! The front desk women we're so passive and would hide in the back of the restaurant so that she wouldn't have to seat or even address that we were waiting for this long length of time!"
201,"I was thoroughly disappointed with the experience my family had for brunch at La Note. My mom arrived at 10:50 am and put her name on the list. She was told that there would be a 20 minute wait. We were finally seated two hours later. My mom was ravenous and asked for some bread. We waited, and waited. No bread. Then my dad asked for bread and a few minutes later it arrived. The restaurant had apparently run out of utensils and so they informed us that they would bring us knives. They never did. I was also disheartened to notice that the ""syrup"" that comes with the $12 pancakes is not maple syrup. Maple syrup costs extra. The ""butter"" that comes with bread tastes like whipped margarine.I believe that the problem may be a structural one. I'd like to suggest to the owner that they buy the right amount of silverware, and train their staff to provide more realistic wait times to people in line. In addition, it might be useful to have an additional server or maitre d' on the floor."
202,"Decent level (but pricey) american diner. (If I was rating it as a diner I would give it three stars.) I have no idea why this restaurants is characterized ""french"" (not even the name is french)."
203,"Honestly, I wish this place were as good as it looks - I'd love to find a French cafe with delicious food with this kind of ambiance. Unfortunately every time I've ever been the food has been solidly mediocre. I can see going for toast and a cappuccino on the back patio, but the kitchen just isn't competent enough to execute any of the dishes on the menu.Too bad."
204,"Brunch is my favorite meal so I was really excited about trying La Note. I had heard so many great things and that La Note was one of the best brunches in the area. So much disappointment... where to begin.Wait time was more than an hour for a Saturday morning, around 11am so we visited Berkeley's campus until they called us (they take your number) to be seated. Once we were seated, it took awhile to order. When we did order, it took an HOUR for us to receive our food. We scarcely saw our waitress and when we did see her she informed us that there was a huge party that had ordered before us so our orders were running late. Really?? Ugh.We got the french toast which was unmemorable. Regular, plain french toast.We also got the lemon-ginger pancakes which had more ginger than lemon. It wasn't a good balance of flavors.Such a disappointment! Not even close to brunch food..."
205,"I've been to this place twice and was disappointed twice. The first time I was there it was alright not the amazing place people make it out to be. I decided to give it another shot and was completely disappointed. I ordered my eggs over hard and it came out runny, the service sucked so bad that I didn't even want to bother wasting time letting them know. Another note, all the servers were crowded into the corner where food is brought out and they were all just talking not paying attention to the needs of the guest eating and laughing and chatting it up, it took the buss er to notice that quite a few tables needed service. Also some of the servers were a bit touchy feely with one another rubbing each others backs and hanging off of one another, at least take it to the back where the guest aren't able to see that."
206,"Today I had the Salade D'Epinards for lunch, plus a glass of water. Â With tax and tip, my lunch came to $15.00. Â The croutons were great! Â Otherwise, it was an unexceptional medium-sized spinach salad with crumbles of cheese and nuts. Â They were small crumbles; most of them fell to the bottom of the bowl. Â It was hard to taste them. Â There were lots of yellow spinach leaves. Â I Â felt it was a waste of money. Â I think the salads at Barney's or Zachary's pizza are much better.The service was good. Â This place gets really busy, and sometimes the wait is long. Â They have a nice garden area in the back."
207,"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and ordered mussels. Several of the very small portion of mussels that I was served were unopened, making them dangerous for me to consume. When I notified my waitress that several of the mussels were unopened she stared at me blankly, not apologizing for the kitchen staff's negligence and treating me as if I was being outrageous for mentioning it. I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant and will never return again."
208,"This place is obviously very popular, but it's hard to see why based on the meal we had the other day. The first course, cauliflower soup, was pretty tasty. The main courses, though, ratatouille and a bagnat (open face sandwich) were unexceptional, and there was absolutely no rosemary in the lukewarm, slightly soggy 'rosemary fries.' Meh."
209,"We went there for Father's day with our daughter and the hostess Neda didn't even bother to wish us. Â Then as were waiting 35 min already after we placed our order she decided to come over and say the wait is about 40-50 min for our food to come out. Â We didn't actually see her again until we were nearly complete with our meal. Â So I would rate the service a D+. As for the food, she recommended the chocolate croissant- it was cold and something I could buy at Safeway. Â The cappucino we received was lukewarm at best. Â The ham and egg omlette was actually really tasty and the brioche cinnamon bread she recommended was average. Â All in all, the food was probably a C. Â I have had much better food with service that was worth waiting 45 min for."
210,"I brought my significant other here for brunch after returning from an extended trip overseas. The food looked good, but after waiting to be seated, we waited another hour at the table without food being served. We ordered multiple items including pancakes, omelette, compote, croissant and drinks. All we received over that hour at the table was one glass of orange juice. We asked our waiter multiple times about the status of our order, but he was too busy to tell us that our ticket was lost by Â the kitchen, he finally told us as we were getting up to leave. We paid for the orange juice and spoke with the manager who asked us to come again. That won't happen. Service matters. This place is disorganized and doesn't recognize that it is ridiculous to wait so long without acknowledgement."
211,"I met up with a Craig's List Date here earlier this year. Â Parking during the lunch time hours can be a challenge. Â After circling around the block 4 times I was lucky enough to park right in front of the Restaurant. Â  The food wasn't that great and they are a little bit on the expensive side for what you get. Â My new friend and I had Les Oeuf Lucas - two eggs lightly scrambled with goat cheese, chieves, served with roasted tomatoes - $11.00; the Cote Nord - two eggs lightly scrambled with cream cheese, over toasted levain bread, with homefries and tomatoes - $12.00 and the Baguette a la merguez-grilled spicy lamb sausage, with sun dried tomato pesto on one half French baguette-$12.95. Â Also she had a glass of wine and I had water. Â All in all, spent about $60 w/tip. Â The place was packed at 11:23am, we sit outside in the back. Â  Oh yeah, Toby McGuire the actor from Lord of Rings was there sitting right across from us. Â Still I wasn't that impressed with La Note. Â Next time I go on another Craig's List date, I definitely won't be going back to La Note."
212,"I have eaten here twice before and had good experiences then, BUT last night I came here for dinner with my husband and we both were not impressed with the food! Â I ordered mussels in a saffron-curry broth. Â The mussels were tiny, basically the size of a pea (litterally) and the broth was just ok! Â The crostini toasts for our appetizer were burned and the various toppings (tapenade, goat cheese , and eggplant caviar) were a bit thinly spread and not very tasty. Â My husband ordered a seafood dish (salmon , mini shrimp, and scallops) in a puff pastry shell, which tasted like a seafood hot pocket, not very good! Â It was also very, very hot in the restaurant, which made it uncomfortable and not very enjoyable overall. Â It is not the cheapest restaurant, but if the food would be good, I would not have problems paying $80 for a meal for two....this, however, was not worth it!"
213,"Came here at 12.15. Went out at 3 pm. ZOMG can anyone tell why my star is 2 instead of 4 or 5??! Yes the service made us WAIT that long in La Note.Honestly, I really think they should hire more staff just so that they can actually comply faster the service of this place. Now, food wise, my favorite is the gingerbread pancakes with the poached pears. ORDER that if by any chance you are here. The rest of the food, was decent, nothing really special about it. I would honestly give the place a 3.5 but if i have to choose between 3 or 4 stars, i would pick 3. Waiting outside for our name to be called wasnt THAT bad, it was only 20 minutes, WAITING for our food was the CRAZY part, i cant believe it would actually take 1 hour to make omelets and roasted potatoes. I CAN make mine in 15 minutes, gezz and they said their oven is doing something funny? Its NOT funny for ME. I do hope my next visit in La Note(not in the near future) would be better, where i can do brunch in an hour ish instead of 3 hours."
214,"I don't know what all the hype is about and was quite disappointed with just about everything here. The wait was ridiculous and by the time we got our table, we were cramped to a table that was obviously too small to accommodate the 3 of us for brunch that day.I got the poulet grille, which is basically a chicken breast sandwich. I don't remember what the other members of my party ordered, but I do remember that everything was mediocre and wasn't anything amazing.I also don't like how they have their jelly in an open bowl on the table. Who knows what people could do to it (double+ dipping, spitting, etc.)! It's VERY unsanitary, especially because they don't replace it after every party. The jelly we had had some remnants of the previous table's food in it. -_______- Maybe I came on a bad day and had a bad server. Everyone was quite rude, which I did not appreciate. Being in the restaurant business, I know how it is when it gets busy, but there are better ways to handle it. Taking your frustrations out on the customers is NOT acceptable. For the price we paid, everything could have been much better."
215,"I drive angry. Â I type angry. Â I'll even sleep angry, but I rarely, if ever, review restaurants angry because I love food too much to be cavalier about the experience. Â That said, I have given myself more than a week to cool down and reassess. Â So, what do I think now? Â Yep, I'm still REALLY angry and have zero intention of returning to La Note any time soon.First and foremost, boyfriend and I have been to La Note several times and have always enjoyed the food. Â This time was no different. Â The food was still high quality, but let me say that the food would've tasted MUCH BETTER had I not had the sour taste of venom tainting every bite.La Note notoriously requires a long wait since it does not take reservations, is delicious, and is right next to the Berkeley campus (ie, teeming with college students +/- their parents and other assorted townies). Â So you can't go to La Note thinking that you're gonna get seated quickly. Â You simply decide whether or not the food warrants the wait. Â You walk up to The List, expecting the worst but hoping for the best. Â Then you cool your heels with hope, neh faith, that the social contract that you've just entered applies fairly to everyone else who is parked in front of the restaurant. Â Apparently this is not the case.Last weekend, I went with boyfriend and another friend. Â There was already a long line, and even then I didn't shove past anyone or ""walk faster"" to get past the couple that was sauntering up to The List. Â I was even gracious enough to politely point out the boy's error when he demonstrated that he didn't know HOW to sign his name onto the list. Â I could have totally just let him sign his name on the wrong sheet, but that's just not the kind of person that I am.Lo and behold, as friends and I stood patiently waiting for the next hour trying to not bother the hostess, several tables got seated. Â At one point, I did start becoming suspicious that other tables who had the same sized or larger sized parties were getting seated before us, but again, I'd like to believe that people are fair and just. Â So when I realized that not one but 2 tables of same sized or larger parties had been seated before us, I was flummoxed as to why that would be the case. Â So I asked the hostess. Â Her only response was that the other table had been pushy and ruder. Â So of course WHY WOULDN'T YOU REWARD THEM WITH A TABLE FASTER?Well, here's to you La Note. Â I'll give you some rude. Â How about I NEVER bother you and your hostess again???!!!! Â Yes, the hostess seated us immediately when she realized that we might be slightly offended that we had been unceremoniously treated like we didn't matter just because we had been polite and not bothered her, but then how do you explain the fact that a waiter didn't come over to our table for 10 minutes once we finally did get seated?In the time that I wasted at La Note, I could have eaten 2 brunches at Inn Kensington, which is always delicious and speedy.Final analysis: Â La Note is La Not!!! Â If you still want to go, make sure to prepare for battle."
216,"My expectations coming here were high based on the raving reviews everyone gives this place. I'm not sure why everyone loves it though, I feel like it might be herd mentality. I came here and ordered the Cote Est which is two eggs, a pancake, and two slices of bacon... for $12.95. For that price, I'm thinking this is going to be some of the best breakfast food ever. No, that did not happen. If you are going to charge that much the presentation of the plate should be good but that wasn't the case. Everything tasted mediocre. I probably could have made the same plate for 1/5 the cost and it would have tasted better. The service wasn't very good either. The server rarely came around to fill up water and I really do think she forgot how to smile. Moral of the story: I will avoid this place in the future."
217,"ive been wanting to come here for a long time and have heard a lot of great things about this place. it started off very promising... i was told the wait here on the weekends are at least 45 minutes to an hour. i came here on a gorgeous saturday and was very pleased that we only waited about 15-20 minutes for a table for two. my boyfriend and i ordered an appetizer to share and each got an entreethe appetizer we ordered, the tartine mistral, came fairly fast. its a very simple appetizer but i really liked it. there was a little too much roasted pepper for my liking, but that can just be easily scraped off. Â for an appetizer, it was pretty big in portion so we only ate half of it because we did not want to fill ourselves up with bread.we've waited for at least over 15 minutes for our brunch entrees but it still did not come. our waitress came to check at almost every table but not ours. we're thinking... maybe we have to finish our appetizer before we would get served our entree? but that doesnt quite make sense... all the parties that got seated after us all got their appetizers andd entrees. finally after almost 30 minutes of waiting, our waitress finally came by and said she doesn't know what is taking so long. by then i was pretty hungry so ended up finishing the entire appetizer. then our waitress came and said that our entrees are being cooked right now and will be out soon. we ended up getting our scrambled eggs and cinnamon french toast almost an hour later from ordering and it was not even hot! it really tasted like our orders have been made a longgg time ago and was just placed under a heating lamp or something and forgotten about. it was even our waitress that gave us our dishes but a random waiter who i guess noticed we were sitting there without anything for a long time.my friends have raveddd about the french toast but the one i had was mediocre at best. maybe because it was served to me kinda cold.. but it was not good and it was way too much bread.blehhh overall, Â it was just an OK experience... glad we did not wait almost an hour to get seated or else that would have been a really upsetting 2+ hours. this place was definitely overhyped for me"
218,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, loooong wait times. I'm ok with waiting for great food, but waiting for what you think will be great food and ending up with ""meh"" food? That's the worst. Of the 3 plates that we got, only 1 of the dishes was even close to being worth the wait. The brioche pain perdu was just scrumptious. Highly recommend it. But the other breakfast items were ranging from bad to mediocre. The potatoes that came with my dish were hard in the middle and underdone. An unforgivable sin as far as I'm concerned. I loooove breakfast potatoes and for them to be inedible... ugh, such a waste! Overall a disappointing experience."
219,"Although the food was tasty, 2 coffee's Cinnamon Brioche bread (2 Medium slices), shared , yes shared an omelet, double stack of creme pancakes. 2 adults $40.00 including a $5.00 tip. The omelet was good but very small and was very sparse on ingredients.  Nice atmosphere with a french feel, kinda. Adequate service with no real hiccups. One odd thing was the garlic in the potatoes still had its skin on... huh?"
220,"I would like to preface by saying that I am not a restaurant snob. I have worked in restaurants and understand that there is a lot of pressure and drinks, food, people, etc. can be forgotten when things get busy, but I had a horrible experience at La Note and am surprised that so many people seem to like it.My boyfriend and I came for a weekend brunch, fully realizing that it was going to be busy. We were told the wait would be about 30 minutes but that a table outside might open up earlier. It was foggy and windy out, but we said whatever was quicker since this was a brunch following a night out and some eggs were much needed. 45 minutes went by, then 55...after about an hour, I went to the hostess when she came out to call a table to see where we were on the list. She said we were next. Another 30 mins went by. This time, I actually went inside to see what the deal was and immediately saw 3 or 4 open 2 tops. I was confused and asked when we could be seated and she responded that there was still a wait on the tables outside and that the indoor tables were being saved for people who came and wanted to sit inside. I told her without any attitude that we did want to sit inside but were willing to sit at the first table that opened up regardless of where it was and that we had been waiting for well over an hour. She kind of starred at me blankly, and said that we would be seated soon.So, after that, we wait another 15 mins (there were no menus so we had to wait for those before we could sit down), we were taken back to the freezing cold patio with a bunch of other groups of two who had literally just arrived. Our wait was about an hour and 45 minutes. Looking back, I have no idea why we didn't just leave then. After being seated, the waiting continued. We sat there, watching servers float around, topping up coffees, chatting with other customers, folding napkins and Â laughing with other servers. No one came to bring water or take drink orders for about 20 or 30 minutes. By this time my slightly hungover self was fuming. I flagged down a waiter, which is something I very rarely do, and she told us with attitude that someone would be with us soon. Our server was nothing special and never acknowledged the fact that it took her so long to come see us. I understand if you are swamped, but if you have time to fold napkins and slowly walk around to other tables, seeing who needs more coffee, there's something wrong. After all this, I didn't really care that my meal was good. Â The staff seemed either entitled and slow or just not that bright. My boyfriend, who is one of the most easy going people on the planet, was even pissed and refuses to ever go back. Based on the other reviews, it seems this place doesn't have too many complaints, but I don't think they'll be seeing us again."
221,"I think this place is way too hyped. The restaurant itself is really cute and I liked the back open patio. However, our waitress wasn't very friendly and the food was not that great. I've had much better brunch plates with greater service. The three of us ordered the French toast, ham & cheese omelette, and the pancakes with poached pears. We all agreed that the ham & cheese omelette was our favorite especially because it came with the delicious garlic homefries. The pancake and French toast had too much of a ginger flavor and the lavendar honey glazing on top was just a tad too sweet for me. We also lost our appetite when we found a piece of hair in the pancake, thus the 2 stars. Overall my experience at La Note was not very satisfactory and I wouldn't go again."
222,"Was kind of a big let down. Â I ordered a signature dish for breakfast (the La Note Pain Perdu) and it rather plain and not filling. Â For the price and the service I can not give La Note 3 stars. Â It was a major turn off watching servers braid a co-workers dreads in plain site in-between serving. Â I would not go back, and it was not memorable in any good ways. Â A lot of better choices in the area, although we may have just experienced a fluke..."
223,"Came here for lunch one day after finding this place on yelp and boy was I disappointed. After reading mostly great reviews, I expected this place to be a lot better than I what I experienced.Although about half the tables were open when we arrived, it still took the hostess over 10 minutes of us standing around to get seated even though I clearly saw a couple of staff chatting over in the back by the bar area. After we got seated a waitress came by after a minute to see if we were ready to order. Haven't even really looked at the menu yet, we just asked for water and to give us a few more minutes............10 minutes later there was still no water.Finally we had to ask another server to get us our water and to take our order. I ordered the pasta special of the day which was bland and tasteless while my girlfriend ordered a french toast with a side of that $3 blueberry compote. She kept giving me the look like, wow do I feel ripped off. I tried the compote that was barely more than a tablespoon's worth for $3 and I knew what she was feeling. It tasted almost like the little packets of jam you find lying around at some diners.Final bill came out to ~$35 after tax and tip for the two dishes and coffee.I had friends come here rave about their experience, but I beg to differ."
224,"We've found that Yelp can generally be trusted when there are a statistically sufficient number of reviews, so we decided to try La Note with high expectations. Its long lines and nice ambience spoke well of things to come. Once we'd eaten there, however, we just couldn't understand how this place got a four-star average. Tried it for breakfast and it was some of the worst food we've had in a long time. The regular French toast was not edible, and when the waiter asked how it was my wife told him, ""worst French toast I've had in my life."" Ordered a single pancake instead and had to pay EXTRA for syrup! WTF? Who charges extra for syrup when you order a pancake? The French toast with Nutella inside tasted like cheap street food that I could make with a loaf of white bread from Safeway and generic chocolate spread. Very disappointing considering the price point we are talking about here. Was the chef off that day? Is this place rated highly because it's trendy? Do they pay people to write nice reviews on Yelp? Whatever the reason, it's not for the food. On the plus side, the service was fine. Want to know what a real breakfast should taste like? Try The Griddle Cafe in Hollywood, and if you can't make the drive to LA, Berkeley does have a McDonald's, and even its breakfast has to be better than this."
225,"I made a reservation (yesterday) for my birthday lunch today at noon for 6 people. When i arrived with my mother at 11:45 i was rudely informed by the hostess that my table was no longer available...that tables were only held for 20 min. I said there must be a misunderstanding, as i made it for 12. Ok, we all make mistakes, but she kept insisting i had made it for 11!! Â So, standing by the door waiting for my sisters/friends, with my 80 year old mother and her walker, she again rudely asked us to move out of the way!! I work in this business and i was appalled by her unneccessarily rude behavior. So unfortunate!"
226,"over-rated.decor is very cute, service was good. Â on a saturday afternoon the wait for two was about 20 minutes.but food was underwhelming and left a lot to be desired:-chocolate croissant didn't taste fresh. Â was slightly chewy, not flakey. Â they could have offered to warm it up.-ginger pear pancakes bland and also chewy. Â not fluffy at all. Â pears tasted canned.-cheese and ham omelette was great. Â but what's not to like about cheese and ham? Â potatoes that came with it were leathery, over baked, not crispy. Â i don't know what the big deal is with the roasted tomatoes. Â i didn't finish mine.-coffee was alright, refills were generous.i won't be back again. Â plow, slow club, sun rise cafe remain my go to favorites."
227,"This review is for the management of this restaurant. Overall it was an ok experience. But there were a few points that are worth mentioning. First of all, the menu is deceiving. The ""fresh squeezed juices"" are not actually fresh squeezed. They're probably Odwalla or something, but not fresh. I find bottled citrus too acidic and can't drink it. And the Merguez sausage is made with Lamb and there's no mention of this on the menu. Even when I inquired about it, the server offered no information on it. Sausages can be made with anything obviously, but usually made with pork sausage unless otherwise specified. I took one bite and nearly hurled. I can't eat lamb, I find it terribly gamey and gross. My plate was also incredibly small for my meal. My toast was literally hanging off my plate and onto the table. I had to ask for a side plate just to access the various items on my plate. We both ordered an egg brunch each and asked for one short stack of these famous lemon pancakes for our ""dessert"". Our server even mentioned that one pancake would be enough for ""dessert"", however all three plates arrived at the same time, on an already small table. So by the time we got to the pancake, it was cold and rubbery. Pretty much tasted like a stale gingerbread soggy cookie. The only upside (1star) was that my 3 minute eggs were perfectly cooked and the roasted potatoes were accompanied with roasted garlic cloves which were great, once I got them peeled, but I love roasted garlic. My boyfriend got the bacon and the scrabbled eggs with goat cheese and chives and they were tasty too. With a few fixes in the menu printing and service kinks, this place would warrant a return visit, but not until then. But if you do want to check it out, be very specific in your ordering and inquiries."
228,Why isn't there a zero star option? Horrible customer service. The food was alright but I specifically told the waiter I wanted to pay half in cash and the rest on my card but he didn't listen and instead he took the cash and charged the whole order on my card. I was outraged. I didn't realize it until the next day when I looked back in my receipt. It's partially my fault but the waiter should have listen and did his part as a waiter. Also we waited for a good hour. I'd give the food a 3 and the service a big fat ugly 0.
229,"It was MLK Monday and everyone seemed to think that it was a Saturday or Sunday. Â Don't gainfully employed people have to go to work? Â This meant that the line was long. Â And there were many people who lie about whether their whole party was present. Â Liars. Â All of them. Â May your college educated children go through as much hubris finding employment. Â I feel like I spent the whole day just eating. Â Not a bad thing, but I wish the things I ate were better. Â Today I had the baguette au magreaux, spicy lamb sausage. Â I don't care if I spelled it wrong. Â It was two sausages on a baguette, smothered in sun dried tomato pesto, with a salad. Â And no cornichons. Â So I requested a few cornichons to go with my sandwich. Â The sun dried tomato pesto was a bit sweet for my taste. Â I like it tart, spicy, greasy, anything really. Â But not sweet. Â Obviously, I'm not from Shanghai. Â Later, when we got the bill, they charged me for the cornichons. Â At first this made me upset because it was not mentioned on the menu. Â Or from the server. Â Or the guy who brought the food. Â And then the service was rushed even though the whole outside patio was empty. Â Too cold for these people who are not working on a Monday? Â They gave me the check about 10 minutes after getting our food. Â I don't think I even picked up my sandwich at that point. Â In conclusion, I like to enjoy the treat when I spend money on ridiculous meals. Â It did not feel like a treat when the service was similar to air line baggage fees and the swift check delivery grab-to-the-throat. Â I was not impressed with this meal. Â The menu is becoming mundane, expensive and trite.UPDATE: Eating the other half of my sandwich the next day, it was not very comfortable on my stomach. Â I don't care that they charged me for cornichons. Â I care that this food is not so delicious."
230,Terrible hostess. Â Rude and would seat people she knew first. Â Way too pretentious. Â Seems like a places would find in LA. Â The food is great and that is why they wait but the rudeness is too much.
231,"A pretty terrible experience at La Note on Saturday morning. We were told ""20-30 minutes"" to sit down by the hostess. After 40 I asked what the status was and they told me ""10-15 minutes."" Ultimately we ended up waiting an hour and 20 minutes before finally being seated, with only a mild apology from the hostess. I realize it's not in their control - but at least being honest about the situation would have been helpful. Had to move the car so that we wouldn't get a ticket in our 90 minute spot. I would have expected to be offered a cup of coffee or a muffin or something like that while putting up with that. The food was ultimately strictly OK once we finally did eat. Will not bother with them again."
232,"I had lunch, never heard of the place until today. My friend and I couldn't decide on a cuisine so we picked this place. I thought it was mediocre and way overpriced for what it was. We ordered the Poulet Grille sandwich and the Merguez Sausage sandwich, a cheese sampler, espresso and a creme brule. Mine was the Poulet, it wasn't really any better than the Tuscan Chicken I had at Safeway, it came with a salad which was really nothing more than lettuce with almost next to nothing when it came to dressing, he said his Merguez was ""all right"".  The cheese platter, a couple wedges of brie and some roquefort and a few pear slices and bread, OK but not worth over 14 bucks. The chicken sandwich was 15.00, my friend had the creme brule, the sugar topping should break with the tap of a spoon, all it did was bend, again run of the mill priced at 7.50, he ordered espresso it was so tiny the sugar cube stood 1/4 inch above the coffee. In the end it was over 65 bucks for a couple sandwiches, some cheese, an espresso and a so so dessert. Maybe breakfast is better. I just thought I was taken."
233,"Most of the food was decent, but for the price I'd at least expect it to be warm. Â My omelette was nice, but the tomatoes that came with it were cold. Â The oatmeal pancakes were gummy and not particularly flavorful, and the syrup tasted like Aunt Gemima. Â Coffee was OK, but that's hardly a selling point in the Bay Area. Â Served in a bowl = insufficient to mask the mediocrity.The pastries are the same you find at all the other local cafes. Â I watched the bread come in from Acme ... a fine bakery, but doesn't one go to the French cafe for something house-baked?Basically, it was all smoke and mirrors here: Â the ambiance of France without the substance. Â One thing they did do perfectly was the slow and disinterested waitstaff -- just like in the old country.Give it a miss."
234,"This restaurant did not honor my reservation but kept us waiting for 30 minutes, all the time assuring us that we would be seated and out in time to go to a play. Â It was crowded, noisy, and the hostess was less than honest. Â We left and ate a few doors down and we were in and out in time to get to our play on time."
235,"FOODcreme fraiche pancake - average, not sure what I was expecting, but not very creamy or fluffy. Â nothing unique or distinctivetoasted cinnamon brioche w/lavendar honey - below average, brioche was too crusty and dry.ham and cheese omellete - average+. Â super cheesy, good quality ham.eggs w/chicken apple sausage - averageeggs w/bacon - average3 orange juicesSERVICE - average, it was crowded, but she was as attentive as she could be. Â waters glasses went empty, plates piled on table.PRICE - expensive (for breakfast)!! Â $75WAIT - 15 min for outside table on sat. late morning. Â Party of 3.Notes: Â Maybe I hyped this place up. Â I was hugely disappointed. Â Breakfast places are so common and there was nothing unique about this place. Â Brenda's has crawfish beignets, Bette and her pumpkin pancake, Lois Pie Queen's biscuits, Mama's crab eggs benedict etc. Â I ordered the staple dishes too, but all I experienced was a mediocre breakfast with a crazy prize tag."
236,"Ate breakfast here with friends after a serious workout at the gym Â My stomach was growling and body needed the protein and carbs. For a party of 4, the service was slow as our cups of coffee were refilled 5 or more times before our food came. Â It took over an hour for our meals to arrive. By then, my hunger was gone, due to the coffee. I ordered the Cote Sud, which was OK. Â Nothing really special if you ask me. Â The spicy merguez sausage was cold and oily. Â Not attractive to eat either, as I could see all the oil ooze out when pressing on the sausage. Hey, I like fat, but not fat that runs all over the plate. Â The gingerbread pancake was Ok as well. Â The saving plus for this was the coffee, as I found the taste of it appealing compared to my dish."
237,"I've been here many times and the food is good, but the service is terrible. Today we waited here for a table for 45 minutes, only to discover that the hostess had already seated several other parties of two who were down on her list after us. When we pointed this out she didn't apologize or explain or even say anything, just stared at us. There are so many other good brunch options in Berkeley that this place isn't worth bothering with anymore."
238,"Went here for breakfast, had to wait FOREVER to get a seat. Our name was on the list, and after repeatedly calling everyone BUT us, we finally asked the server when we would be seated and she nonchalantly says, ""Oh. looks like I skipped over you"" WHAT! Anyways, we sat down. I ordered the ginger/lemon pancakes or whatever-- They were not that great. I liked their french toast, potatoes, and spicy sausage. Essentially, I would go back if there wasn't a long wait, but definitely not a must try. I'd also recommend the outdoor seating, very quaint."
239,"My cousin made a reso for the fam to brunch at La Note - a small celebration for our grandmother. The initial reso was made for outdoor seating. The manager called my cousin 15 minutes prior to the reso to tell her it was too cold outside, why dont we sit inside but if it clears they'll set the table outside..We get there, it's sunny outside - yet now the patio is booked solid. They gave up our table and crammed us inside. When I say crammed, i mean a table for 3 has now been converted into a table for 4 - our elbows are touching. We're pissed.. Then, the service was HORRIBLE! The waitress doesn't even ask us if we want anything to drink.. I had to keep calling her over. The food was just average! I had the ahi tuna sandwich and it was dry and anything but delicious. I don't think I'll ever come back! No thanks.. Bad Service and Bad Food = Good-Bye!"
240,"No go! the food was mostly ok, my chicken (curry chicken) was a bit dry on the inside but not enough to send back, my husband got the steak and that was pretty good. The real reason to avoid avoid avoid was the service. First we ordered an appetizer and we had to ask for plates, no big deal. Then when our mains were brought out we had no forks, again no big deal but also kind of annoying since we had to flag our waiter down. Then we finish our wine about halfway through our meal--and then wait. The whole staff is hanging out, one of the waitresses starts playing with her hair in front of the big mirror behind the bar, we stop eating because we want another glass of wine to go with the rest of our meal, pretty standard. So then the whole staff sits down for dinner, they have wine. I still have no wine. Finally we flag down a bus boy to get somebody to bring us wine, which they do, but they don't take our old glasses, which sit there until we move them to Â the empty table next to us (the two tops are on the small side). Then I had my plate to my husband to finish my meal, which this is a least a third of left and the waiter tries to hand me a dessert menu. We're not going to order dessert while he's still eating dinner. Then. Well then nothing. Nothing. We sat there for at least 15 minutes to see if they were going to offer us dessert. But no, whole staff meal, no less than 5 people eating at the table across the restaurant in full sight of the patrons and nobody noticed we were now 1) out of wine again and 2) hadn't been offered the dessert menu again. What a joke. So after the 15 minutes the waiter offers us a dessert menu. When we say we've been waiting he doubles down and tells us we could have ordered dessert when we were still eating dinner. Yeah. No. Then on our way out he mentions that if we want to talk to a manager there isn't one there but we could call back. YEAH WE KNOW THERE ISN'T ONE THERE. THE WHOLE TEAM WAS ROCKING OUT EATING DINNER WITH AT LEAST 10 people still eating. The girl next to us had to hand her dinner plate to the bus boy as he walked by because her waiter (or waitress, didn't catch who was serving them) just put her crÃ¨me brulee on the table in front of her dinner plate. Anyway--I really like Liaison! Go there! Go anywhere else--or maybe call ahead and see if the manager is there? I don't know... just don't do it. Not on a Saturday night and not for $82 (oh and I didn't tip, I think that's the first time I've ever done that, I'm usually a base of 20% and you have to be pretty bad to get 18%)"
241,"it bums me out to only give this place 2 stars. Â when you first walk in, it's like you're walking into a small cafe in nice... sooo adorable. Â then the menu!! Â AHH!! the potential!!!! Â unique pairings, special options created from gourmet visions! :0)........... then it all was downhill from there.....the server was rude to begin with and didnt tell us that the pears that came with the gingerbread pancakes were out, so my partner got her pancakes with blueberries on top.... that wasnt what she ordered. Â they should know what they're out of and communicate that. Â she didn't bring out the lavender honey... then acted like we were bothering her asking for what was supposed to come with the meal!both of our food plates were luke warm like they had been sitting off to the side of the pan for 15 minutes...not nearly... not even a little close to as tasty as the menu makes the food sound.again, soooo much potential, however, this place has no idea how to manifest that potential.blah...AND the coffee was weak.bummer."
242,"Note: this review is for the dinner items, I haven't had lunch.I've been here twice and both times had very poor quality food. Â One time I had rubbery chicken on a bland roll while the other time I had the sausage of the time which was a hot dog and not a very good one at that. Â We also had one of the desserts one time and it involved pears out of a can. Â Just really low quality ingredients in my opinion"
243,"2.5-3 starsOkay, I love breakfast/brunch food as much as the next person, or actually, probably A LOT more. However, after visiting La Note many times over the past four years, I've come to the conclusion that this restaurant is over-freakin-rated. Yes, their specialty pancakes and cutesy water goblets are TO DIE FOR, but their service is slow, the wait is generally long, and frankly, a standard egg and potato meal shouldn't cost more than $12 TOPS. Plus, in true French fashion, the place is cramped."
244,"OVERRATED.Waited an hour to get a table. Â Even though I was famished, the Les Oeufs Maison with Merguez sausage was just meh. Â The over medium eggs were too runny, the home fries were burnt, and the sausage had a weird unappealing aftertaste. Â I couldn't even bring myself to finish one sausage link.The table/chairs were sticky and there were crumbs left by the previous diners. Â The little jar of jam on the table is really unsanitary. Â There's no lid and who knows whose fingers have touched the jam or what has fallen in and been fished out. Â Blech. Â I'm losing my appetite just reminiscing about it."
245,"We decided to give this place another try since we were around the area and after a so-so experience the first time around. Â We ordered the deux stack lemon gingerbread pancake/poached pears, brioche pain perdu (cinnamon french toast), and a side of rose-mary garlic home fries. Â The wait was only 15 mins, however, we waited over half an hour for our food. Â The pancake was super dry, not moist at all, and ""thick"". Â My gf said it tasted like cardboard. Â I tried to eat it but only finished a third by downing a ton of water with every bite. Â The brioche pain perdu and homemade fries were average. Â We certainly will not come back. Â La Note..more like La NOT!"
246,"One of the employees (possibly the manager?) is extremely RUDE and disrespectful. Â I called in for a dine in order - two different people had to take my order down so I had to repeat my order twice. Â We arrived and my order was packed to go. Â I asked if we could eat it in the restaurant and the employee/possible manager was adamant about the fact that we could NOT eat what we ordered inside the restaurant. Â She then walked away. Â I told an employee nearby that I didn't understand why that was an issue and she stated that she also didn't understand that policy but has to defer to the woman making the rules. Â I asked if I could order a coffee and drink that in the restaurant or if a coffee also has to be a ""to go"" order. Â  The woman who refused to let us eat in the restaurant returned and said that she would make a one time exception for us today. Â  Beware of the super snobby service and bad attitude. Â The food is amazing (we had the pancakes, french toast, potatoes, bacon, and an omelet) and the waitress was a sweetheart. Â Oh, the mocha's are not very hot."
247,"I recently moved to Berkeley. La Note has been beloved by friends in the area for years, so when we decided to go for Sunday brunch I was really looking forward to it. Â I realize this place is popular, so I am not deducting any stars here for the one hour wait outside prior to being seated. Once seated, the service was horrible. It took the waitress over 20 minutes to even speak to us, once we ordered it took another 30 minutes to get our food and at that point it was cold! Starving at this point and in about 1.5 hours between the wait outside we decided to just eat our expensive, cold brunch. Â Food really wasn't spectacular. Â Then, which really took the icing on the cake and the reason I WILL NEVER TRY THIS PLACE AGAIN is that our entire table witnesses our waitress seat a group of friends who show up (of course without any waiting) and then completely ignore us. Â I don't think I will ever try this restaurant again. Â Very very disappointed! Â One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had."
248,"I've eaten here a couple of times and the last time just made me never want to come back again. The food is good but the service is horrible. If the hostess changed her ""the wait time is an hour and a half, oh well take it or leave"" attitude, maybe I'd be more empathetic. But after my last visit, I'd never come back to this establishment and I don't care how good the food is."
249,"My friend brought me to this quaint little diner for breakfast. We were seated immediately which was nice because when we got out there was a ridiculous wait. We took a while to order what we wanted, but when we finally did, it took 30+ minutes for our food to come out.I ordered the Brioche Pain Perdu, my friend got the Lemon Gingerbread Pancakes and Poached Pears and my third friend got the Le Panier Du Boulanger. The brioche was just okay. It didn't strike me as amazingly delicious. It was dry, not fluffy, had no garnish, didn't taste very strongly of anything except stale slabs of bread barely touched with honey. The plating didn't make the bread look very appetizing either. I ended up barely finishing half of my dish and not touching my leftovers for the remainder of my Berkeley trip. Very underwhelming. The Gingerbread was okay, but I should be criticizing it much since I've never been a gingerbread fan. But the assorted croissants, oh my goodness, they were SO good. I ended up eating more of her plate than my own. The downer is that they actually get the croissants from another bakery around here (a famous one that locals would remember, but I couldn't) except for the plain one. All in all, decent price for mediocre food with a dragged out wait left me not a big fan of La Note."
250,"La Note....La Not! Came here for brunch on a Saturday. I read all the good reviews and thought I should try it. We came early so no wait. We ordered pancakes, eggs, toast, and a couple other things. The food was just ok, nothing amazing at all. Our food came out cold, eggs with the side tomatoes cold! Also not very good in taste. Our pancakes were very plain, not much flavor. Yes, they look pretty...but we dont taste with our eyes. The best part of our meal was the bread with raspberry jam, which I can get at any farmers market. Can't say I'll be coming here again."
251,this place was underwhelming...the food was bland bland bland. Â the bouillabaise broth lacked flavor...i even let it sit for a while hoping that the seafood would infuse a little bit more savory goodness.the poulet au prunneux looked incredible. Â very colorful and nice presentation. Â looks can be deceiving...again no flavor and no seasoning. Â surely they have salt in france???the best stuff we ate at this place were the aisiette crudites & charcturie (vege and meat plate) appetizers.a note on our waitress with librarian glasses....you are one of the worst waitresses i've had in years. Â thanks for slamming our plates on the table! Â thanks for lip service when it's your own damn fault you forgot to put in a drink order! Â drink bar backed up you say? Â liar!!berkeley as tons of amazing restaurants....this is not one of them.
252,"Don't ever go to La Note if you have a big party/group. Â I was there Saturday night and had 9 people in my dinner party. Â We made reservations and we had to wait and no one seemed to know where to seat us. Â I had a bad vibe, but overlooked the incident. Â It wasn't crowded but clearly they couldn't handle a large party for dinner.We got seated and then NO one came to give us our menu. Â We had to flag someone for the menu. Â When I asked about the pre-fixe menu the waitress looked thoroughly confused and you can see on her face she had no clue what we were talking about. Â She disappeared for a long time and then came back with the printouts! Â She had no idea the restaurant had a pre-fixe menu! Â She is the senior wait person! Â Then the pre-fixe menu we had to have 10 people in order to get the meal?! Â Obsurd. Â My irate friend went up to her and asked for the manager. Â By now, the waitress was irritated with us. Â The waitress called the owner and gave us the phone to speak with the owner about our dissatisfaction with the service! Â She is handing us the phone!!!! Â She can't deal with the issue at hand? Â Ok, we finally flagged her down to take our order and she rolled her eyes heavenwards. Â That was bad on her part and WE will NEVER go there again. Â By now, the restaurant was full before she took our order. Â Later, the owner came and apologized but she had a weak personality and didn't seem to know how to handle the situation! Â Her apology was weak and obviously this restaurant had good ratings from Zagat for the food, but the service was poor ""0."" Â  If my dinner party wasn't so big we would have walked out. Â Two tables away, clearly they did walk out. Â Now for the dinner. Â I think my mistake was ordering the vegetable stew. Â I had better so I was sorely disappointed. Â Overall, the entire evening the service was deplorable. Â I had good company which saved the evening. Â This is not Â a dinner place! Â The restaurant staff can't handle a party of 9. Â It's a shame. Â They don't need our business and we will never go back either."
253,"Wait time was around 40 minutes on a Sunday around 10 or 11. My friend and I felt in the mood for something both savory and sweet but unfortunately nothing on the menu gives you both unless you spend more money to get side orders. I'm a big coffee person so I had to order a cup immediately after sitting because I was starting to get a headache. They never refilled my cup and I had to resort to getting up and asking someone if I could get more coffee because no one came by. While standing up I didn't realize that I knocked over my chair and it probably hit some old man in the back. Not my fault, La Note! My friend was gracious enough to pick up my mess without me noticing... She ordered the french toast and I ordered the cheese omelette that comes with potatoes and toast. The food took soooo long to get to our table and we were starving (and admittedly a little hung over and hadn't eaten that morning). So we were in serious need of a breakfast feast. When it finally came out we got our coffees refilled (for the first time by our waiter) and we were definitely ready to eat. The food was pretty good but I wouldn't say it was anything to write home about. I mean, I felt like I could have made that omelette at my house and it would have tasted better. It didn't taste bad, it just didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would. The potatoes were better than potatoes that I could make so no complaints there. The French toast was tasty but it was also smothered in syrup. It was kind of hard to cut which makes me think the bread was a little too stale to be using. All in all, I enjoyed the meal but at that point I would have eaten anything because I had to wait for so long prior to the meal. We ended up getting out of there around 1 or 1:30 pm. I couldn't believe so much time had gone by. Then I remembered about all the waiting, then I definitely could believe it. I don't think i'd come here again unless I knew the wait time wasn't going to be so bad. Also, the price is not really worth it compared to the effort they put into the food. Do NOT come here if you're hungover. There's always crowds of people everywhere and wherever you are, you're going to be waiting there for a long time hungry and sober."
254,"I went to La Note previously because they advertised pain perdu. Â What a disappointment. Â It was more like Semifreddie cinnamon bread made into French toast. Â Not the real deal. Â The La Boulange restaurants used to do a real pain perdu that was fabulous. Â Don't know if they still do.Went back to La Note the other day and gave it another try. Â From reading the reviews I tried the oatmeal raspberry pancakes. Â Another disappointment. Â The pancakes were flat, not fluffy. Â Bacon was greasy. Â Ham was extremely salty."
255,"The food is well made, but not extraordinary.The service is average.We had a 1.5 hour wait today. Â I would not complain about waiting itself, that is not the issue. Â My issue is how the hostess handled the wait, missing us, and leaving my wife, my sister and myself. Â That mistake will cost La Note my business."
256,"Dont know why this place has 4 stars honestly.. We were seated out back which was nice since we had to wait almost an hour to get our food. The waitress did a great job since she was the only one serving the back. I really felt bad for her, she really worked her butt off and was trying to take care of everyone that was back there. I think they should have had one more server back there. The food was ok really nothing to brag about, i think honestly waititng almost an hour kind of killed the whole experience for me.. dont think i will be back theres way more far better places to eat and experience then to waste my time there again."
257,Food is average. Service is unfriendly and you get crammed in like a can of sardines. Very uncomfortable. I wonder if they are in compliance with maximum occupancy levels?
258,"I'm somewhere between 2 and 3 stars here. Â The food was fine, but for the price could have wowed me a bit more. Â Don't recall the last time I had to add *that* much salt and pepper and hot sauce to an omelet to give it some flavor. Â But my husband liked his food (2 eggs and bacon, not too hard to screw that up) and my daughter's pancake seemed pretty good. But then there was the service. Â How did it make the overall experience suck? Â Let me count the ways:1. Â Ok, it's Saturday morning. Â I get it, it's busy. Â But could the hostess please be on the ball/present/at the hostess station? Â I walked in and waited for a while before seeing anyone, then the hostess emerged, looking like she was PO'd to have to deal with *another* customer and sort of gestured at the list. Â At this point, I still thought she was a waitress, because a hostess would be up there, well, hosting. Â So I said, ""Oh, do we sign our own names on the list?"" Â ""Yeah"". Â Ok -- no word on the expected wait time, and what annoyed me the most was that she did not mention that sitting in the yard was an option, nor that the yard was practically empty and we could get seated right away if we wanted to sit there. Â 2. Â  So my husband goes and tells her that we are ok with sitting in the back (we had marked this on the list) and then she goes, ""Oh, really?"" Â (no, that's why we marked it on the list, sheesh) and then ""OK, I can seat you now."" Â Um, now you tell us. Â 3. Â We go to our table and she drops the menus on the table and disappears. Â 4. Â Meal service -- our order was taken and the food came and then that was it. Â No one came around after that. 5. Â We had to flag down a busser to get a coffee refill. 6. Â We had to get up and get our own jam from the waitstation because we couldn't get anyone's attention. 7. Â No one checked in, asked if we needed/wanted anything more, etc. 8. Â Pet peeve: don't ask me if I am done/try to take my plate while I am in the middle of taking a bite of food. Â Clearly I am not done. Â 9. Â Other pet peeve: don't drop the check while we are still eating. Â I know you want us out of there, but geez. Â Let's try to maintain the illusion that you *want* customers. Â I don't think I need to go back. Â There are better breakfast places."
259,The Genova Deli in Oakland made me my sandwich with so many condiments with the prosciutto-mozzarella that it could have been turkey feathers for all the taste I got of the main ingredients. The hot-sour slaw and pickles burned my mouth and left me with heartburn. One has to tell the counterman what to leave out this that and the other and I didn't. But they have no idea how an Italian sandwich should be constructed.
260,"Review is for breakfast/brunch. I've been to La Note three times. Â Impression came down from a five to a three to a two when I realized I was seeing La Note ""en rose.""I want to like it so much, because it's just so darned cute. Â But honestly, they need hold back a bit on the sugar. Â And the prices are a tad steep. Â And they don't take reservations, so it takes foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to get in on a weekend because of the undeserved hype this place gets.But their raspberry jam is super delicious and the service is generally good, though slow."
261,"Waited nearly an hour for food, only to be served cold eggs, a cold pancake, and cold home fries. I don't mind waiting for food, because that usually means it's being made fresh and will be served piping hot. I don't wait an hour for cold stuff.Hostess was curt and our waitress gave us straight attitude when we asked if there were fries coming. I get that it's a stressful job, but I'll gladly take my business to someone who can do the job with a smile. Which is why I will stick to Venus which has better food and better people!"
262,"A friend and I went to LaNote today! Â This used to be great place to eat several years ago. Â What happens to restaurants, well they change staff, food changes sometimes for the better, some for worse. Â We ordered capucchino seco (dry in Italian), neither my friend or I could drink the bitter, stale coffee...returned for regular, which was OK.Food was not outstanding, had poached eggs-which were almost overdone, couldn't eat potatoes, bread was just awful..Now in this city of delicious bread offerings, why were my poached eggs accompanied by balloon whole wheat bread...by the way, waitress came at end of meal to explain to us that other people had complained about the coffee. Â Not going back...being in the food biz, mediocre food just doesn't cut it, must say our waitress was very good."
263,"Went there on a regular weekday for lunch with a group of colleagues. Food was nice, but the service was pretty terrible. One of us was on a schedule, and once the wait for the food was getting lengthy we asked the waitress for help and politely suggested alternatives that would likely speed things up. Her answers were mainly indications that those suggestions were likely to take as long if not longer. In the end the wait was still around 45 minutes, with all of our orders showing up together.I've been to La Note many times. I used to veto it after we were once sent away well within opening hours still. This time, the food was nice as usual, but there's always something about this place that keeps me underwhelmed. Quel dommage."
264,"So I came here, expecting great things from all the hyped up reviews, but was slightly disappointed. I mean, don't get me wrong, the food was alright, but honestly I've had better, for example, ""Stacks"" over in Burlingame.I ordered the omelette w/ ratatouille over it (which basically tasted like salsa) that came along with sourdough bread and some potatoes (which I think pales in comparison to those from Crepevine). The omelette was very fluffy so I'll give points for that but honestly, this place is more about ambiance than actual food. Boyfriend ordered the lemon gingerbread pancake which I tried, and again could not appreciate.So yes, try it out if you want because everyone else seems to think this place is wonderful, but I've had better."
265,"If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know I don't mind waiting in hour long lines for good food (especially breakfast/brunch.) However, I do mind (very much) waiting just to have not so good, coldish food served to me by a waitress with an attitude. I had the omelette with potatoes, onions & tomatoes & it was just okay. My friends & I shared a short stack of creme fraiche pancakes & they didn't taste any different from regular buttermilk pancakes from any diner USA. My friend's coffee cups were refilled, but only after we asked 2-3 times. Food is on the affordable side because the restaurant is located in a college town & the french decor is quite cute. But none of that makes up for food that just isn't all that great."
266,"Charming yellow and periwinkle colored walls and tables created a comfortable feel. Â Friendly waiters buzzed around taking ordered, refilling coffee, and water. Â  Its such a cute place to go! Â Unfortunately the food was a little less than what we had hoped. Â It wasn't horrible just hit and miss. Â Buttery warm cinnamon coffee cakes were eagerly devoured. Â Ratatouille was full of squash and tomatoes with perfected seasonings. Â But sadly everyone's eggs were leathery. Â The ginger pancakes were full of spicy sweetness but was a tad chewy."
267,"I felt totally ignored by the wait staff here. After being seated and selecting what I wanted, it took almost 15 minutes to even get acknowledged. seriously.. didn't even get my water glass filled for that long. After finally getting my food, i was asked if i wanted catsup or tabasco sauce. I said yes to the tabasco but even that was forgotten.. ugh. The omelette was decent but my experience was definitely soured by the poor service. Get it together guys!"
268,"Went here for the second time to give it a chance all the Yelpers are raving about. Both times we went in a group of 4 and each person chose a different plate so we can try more things. Nothing was exceptionally great, the food was OK maybe good at best for me. Super long wait to be seated and the servers take forever to come back around to your table for drinks/refills/napkins etc. What really factored into my review was the pricing, it was"
269,"I really hate to give such a cutesy spot two stars, but the food was just so BLEH every time I have gone. I am a total sucker for the French-y atmosphere and the quaint theme they've got going on, but the food is not impressive to me at all. My eggs were tasteless, the jam was alright, and the wait was FOREVER. I don't think this place is necessarily bad, in fact it is probably average, I really don't remember the food anymore now since it was so unmemorable, but for the prices and for the wait, I think it is way too overhyped. NEXT."
270,"The food was nothing spectacular and it wasn't anything to boast about. I enjoyed the home fries, very garlicky which I like. However, that was about it. Everything else was just so-so and it's expensive for a quick lunch, don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.When I got there the hostess wasn't even present so I waited for a mere 5 minutes before being seated and mind you, there were plenty of seating available."
271,"How sad! Â All our previous experiences a La Note had been excellent, wonderful food, service and ambiance. Â Today was a different story, I'm hoping it was just an off day...Hubby had Â the Omelette w/Ratatouille and a side order of merguez sausage. Â I ordered Â un plat de Ratatouille avec couscous....Omelette: Â bland, no seasoning, with bland ratatouille ladled over it. Â Nothing special. Â Someone forgot to salt the home fries... would have be tasty if there had even been a smidgen of salt to bring out the flavors. Â (My husband and I eat a low-salt diet and we could tell there was no salt at all). Â Sad again. Â The toaster must have been set lower than 1...the toast would not qualify to be called toast.The ratatouille had eggplant, zucchini, and CANNED TOMATOES. Â omg... Â what are they thinking.... Â The ratatouille I make myelf has onions, bell peppers, fresh tomatoes, eggplant, zucchinni, garlic, and seasonings. Â Is this a case of ""when the boss is a away, the mice will play"" Â or is this a case of La Note having sadly gone downhill???Couscous: Â again bland, no flavors or seasonings. Â I read on other postings the couscous had a taste of rosemary. Â Not today's couscous...today it was just couscous cooked in hot water. Period. Â Sparkling apple juice: Â sad. Â This was frozen concentrated 'organic' apple juice with carbon dioxide added. Â Not even a boule of cidre! Â Non-alcoholic. Â Very meh... Â Not American, not French. Â Just middle of the road... perhaps Iowa???Coffee: Â omg...good beans....made in a dirty pot with acidic residue from earlier pots of coffee during the day. Â Believe me, we have a palette. Â This was bad! Â Acidic, almost metallic aftertaste. Â Yuk.Saving grace .... Cafe St. Tropez.... a sublime dessert... 2 scoops of coffee ice cream, strong coffee, whipped cream, chocolate sauce. Â This ROCKED!!!!The meal came on attractive plates and really loved the boule that the Cafe St. Tropez came in!Huge minus: Â Restrooms were ... shall we say... 'unmentionable'. Â At Â least two ladies walked out of the restroom with toilet paper somehow stuck to the bottom of their shoes. Â No comment what was on the floor of the restrooms. Â *** Please have your staff check the restrooms hourly *** No public rest room should be in this condition! *** Â Lunch came to $56.00 for two. Â Not worth it. Â Not going back any time soon. Â Bring back the old La Note!"
272,"Up front why the two stars - but for one huge boo, this is a three to three and half star restaurant with solid to very good food, nice ambiance and good value for your dollar. Â But if you bring our main courses when we are not even half way done with the appetizers, and then offer to solve the very real space problem on the teeny tiny table by taking away the food we are still eating, then two starts is as high as you can go. Â Finishing a cold appetizer while watching our hot main courses cool (and working to avoid putting an elbow in the plates on the table) is not what I bargained for in a decent restaurant like this.That said -- cute place, good food, reasonable prices. Â The charcuterie appetizer had nice variety, and came on a tasty bed of greens. Â House pasta was good, but not exceptional. Â Steak Frites was tasty - steak was perfectly cooked (when it hit our table) and very tender. Â The wine list leaves much to be desired in variety and quality, but the available choices are OK."
273,"New Review:A friend really wanted to go to La Note for lunch and couldn't be persuaded otherwise. So I went. I paid $13 for a salad made of canned corn and overcooked hard boiled egg. I don't understand this restaurant. Old Review:I give La Note 5 stars for food, but take away 4 for the worst service in the Â East Bay. I've given La Note half a dozen or so chances. I used to live less than a block away, so this isn't based on one bad experience.Their dinner menu is wonderful if you actually get your food while it is still warm. Their wine menu is diverse and there is something for everyone if you actually get your bottle before your food arrives.The wait staff here is snooty and pretentious. They are absolutely unapologetic and do not care if you are hungry or if you have been waiting for your food for over 40 minutes. Bottom line, order your meal take out. Set up a nice table at home with candles and open a bottle of your favorite wine. The food is lovely and you're more likely to enjoy it warm if you take it home."
274,"I came here after I saw that it was showcased on Food Network (Rachael's Vacations) and saw some yummy looking dishes.I ordered the Brie sandwich on a toasted baguette. Being that this is a French restaurant, and the price ($13), I imagined a triple creme Brie that was buttery and delicious. What I got instead was cheap low end Brie that I could get from Safeway (and have actually bought before) where the rind is gross and Brie lacks in flavor. It was sandwiched in a good baguette though. My partner ordered the omelet with the potatoes and onions ($12), which was one of the dishes on FN. The TV version was exactly what the menu suggests, an open-faced omelet with caramelized onions and potatoes underneath. What he got was much smaller in portion, the onions (which can be sweeter than sugar if done right) were sauteed and not caramelized what-so-ever.... and as if to hide the fact that the onions weren't caramelized, the omelet was all mushed together and not open faced. He also used hot sauce and ketchup to mask the lack of flavor. We went on Sunday so it was busy, and the restaurant is rather small inside. It was so ""cozy"" that we couldn't talk during our brunch unless we shouted at each other. The waitstaff was okay given the traffic in there, but I felt rushed because my waitress asked me if I wanted a box when I was only half done with my sandwich and took a break to drink tea and shout across our tiny table.In short, I felt that it wasn't worth the price and I wasn't impressed. I pretty much make the same dishes at home."
275,"I still don't understand how people rate this so highly. Â I've been to La Note three times for brunch. Â Each time was served cold potatoes. Â The last time I went, which will stay my last, my potatoes were not only cold, but had a piece of broken glass in them. Â This was a couple years ago, but i don't need to risk my life for a luke-warm brunch, regardless of how many people rave about it."
276,Horrible service and mediocre food! I was really disappointed with my experience after hearing so much about this place prior to my visit.
277,I think I expected a little more from Berkeley restaurants more than anywhere else in the East Bay. There's always a huge wait outside for some reason. Â The interior decor was unique and crowded with charm. Â My favorite thing about the place is the complementary boysenberry jam they serve on the table. Â Their water glass pictures were oober cute with the lemon slices. Â But my infatuation with the place stopped there. I ordered the omelet fromage et jambon (emmenthal cheese and ham) but I think they messed up my order because there was no trace of ham on site. Â I even dug into the interior. Â The cheese was bitter and wasn't as good. Â The toast was the only good piece of my brunch... but you can't really mess up toast! Â The bf ordered eggs with apple smoked sausage... I stole a piece.. and it is to die for!!!! Overall... I thought it was an alright average overpriced place for some eggs and toast...
278,"Very average in every sense of the word and even bordering sub-average. After hearing the hype and seeing long lines outside the place for brunch, I decided to take a friend here for dinner. We came in and got absolutely no attention-- the greeters obviously saw us but they looked away and carried on with what they were doing. They could have AT LEAST asked us hold on a second while they were obviously not doing their job and doing something else. Anyway, just as we were about to pick up 2 menus and seat ourselves, a girl comes up, no apology whatsoever, and seats us. By the time we had picked what we wanted, we waited a good 15 minutes for a waitress to come up and ask us for drink orders! Outrageous. We declined and ordered our entrees. I ordered the Ratatouille and my friend ordered a seafood stuffed puff pastry. My order was absolutely ordinary and bland and I found myself salting and peppering it every so often (which I rarely do at restaurants). The rosemary fries were also bland and soggy-- ugh my biggest pet peeve. Just a few more service problems included not filling up our water pitcher, NEVER coming up to ask if there was anything else we needed other than when we had ""finished"" our meal (we both had leftover and not because the portions were that large) and were in need of the check. In retrospect, I don't even know why I left a decent tip. Anyway, NEVER going back...maybe brunch is a completely different story but I'm definitely hesitant to even give it a try."
279,"My family and I were in Berkeley for the weekend for my sister's graduation, and we made reservations here for brunch. As a lover of French food, I was excited to eat here, and my sister had been wanting to try it for a while. Unfortunately, our experience with the hostess was so terrible that we didn't even stay to eat. Our reservation was for 10:30, but we arrived at around 10:25 (it was raining outside, so we got there early). The hostess told us it would be a short wait and that they were cleaning our table for us. After a few minutes, we saw that a table for 4-6 people had been cleaned up, but when we asked the hostess if our table was almost ready, she rudely told us our reservation was for 10:30 and it was only 10:30 then. We waited a little longer, and a family of four who had walked in AFTER us (who also had a reservation for 10:30) got seated immediately at the table that had just been cleared. My mom stood up to look around for another table (without saying anything), and the hostess came over and rudely told my mom, ""Ma'am, you need to be patient. Your reservation isn't until 10:30, and it's only 10:30 right now."" My mom corrected her and told her it was actually 10:35. The hostess brushed my mom off and walked away. We waited a little longer to see if a table would open up, but it seemed like no one was clearing any tables, so we left, not wanting to have the hostess come over and give us rude looks or brush us off again.It's really a shame that the hostess was so rude, because the food on everyone's plates looked really appetizing, and the portions seemed pretty big, too. The hostess was unfortunately our first and only actual experience with the restaurant, and I'm a bit hesitant to go back."
280,"I've figured out the secret to running a restaurant: make people wait forever, name the food something that sounds good, bring out mediocre food, and they magically think it's awesome because they're starving!!Our wait was not that long at 9:30 on a Saturday game day. I ordered what everyone said was great: Lemon Ginger Pancakes, Brioche Pain Perdu, and Rasberry and Grapefruit Mimosas. Everything was just meh. I have been more excited at IHOP with the tastes in my mouth. Nothing to pay extra for. And I wasn't even tripping about the price because it was on my dad! It just simply wasn't very good food. The pancake came with small, cold slices of pear (that poached or not, simply tasted like pear) and didn't go well with the syrup. The ""amazing"" strawberry jam, just tasted like strawberry jam that you get in a jar. And the french toast (""pain perdu"") tasted mainly like bread--I've made better french toast. The raspberry mimosa just tasted like champagne with no raspberry and the grapefruit mimosa just tasted like grapefruit juice..I don't get it. And I won't be going back to try it again."
281,"The food here is OK. Â Not outstanding. Â When you combine that fact with the insane wait times, and the loud environment - I just cant seem to bring myself to try it again."
282,"I am having a hard time understand the vast number of 4-5 star reviews based on my recent experience. While it was not bad it was quite average. My wife wants to give it Â a second try.Atmosphere. It looked pleasant enough but it was so crowded and noisy I could not appreciate it that much.Service. Our server was pleasant but perhaps a little too relaxed. We waited a little longer than I would have preferred for everything from receiving a menu, to ordering coffee to getting coffee to ordering food to getting food to getting the bill, to getting change. In fact we gave up on getting change and just left a probably too large tip.Food. Eggs with chives and goat cheese, toast and roasted tomatoes on the side. I was hoping for more flavor than it delivered. One of the roasted tomatoes was the highlight of the meal - nicely spicy. The other two tomatoes were oddly bland. Eggs were well cooked, but bland. Goat cheese was very tame. I am pretty sure I could have done at least as well at home - which is sad.Coffee. Very pleasant and smooth. For a French restaurant I would expect something a little stronger and roasty. It doesn't make for a good cafe au lait.So, as I said all the glowing reviews confuse me. I just didn't find it that special. The sunshine cafe on Oxford is better imho."
283,"If you'd like to wait an hour for ""French"" food that you could make better at home and croissants that suck compared to the ones they serve at Fat Apples then by all means waist a morning at this highly over rated restaurant. The service is always bad. Always. The wait is always too long. Always. Don't bother with this spot."
284,"La Note has been my breakfast spot of choice for the last six months or so. Â My bff and I decided to try this spot for a ladies' valentines dinner since they were offering a romantic prix-fixee menu, and I have to say that although I will still frequent this spot during the brunch hours I don't think I'll ever come back after dark.The menu was promising, but when the food arrived it was a little uninspired and lacking in character. Â Our mushroom quiche starter was fine; the pork roulade and seafood pastry entrees were both alright although not terribly exciting; dessert was the highlight even though the bread pudding was a touch too sweet. Â What really killed the meal for me was the wine. Â The server's two suggestions were both bombs, and not in the good way. Â The service otherwise was excellent, but I just can't justify paying someone to cook me mediocre food.Breakfast, I love you. Â Dinner, not so much."
285,"Quickly got a table for brunch on a saturday, so the visit started off well. The food was decent, i had scrambled eggs, bacon and a creme fraiche pancake. My dbl cappuccino wasnt bad. But we mustve waited over half an hour for our breakfast. It was super unreasonable and the lengthy wait was never acknowledged by the server, who was otherwise polite. I cant emphasize enough how long it took for the food to come and it left a sour enough taste in my mouth that i wont be coming back anytime soon. The food wasnt good enough to justify the wait either. While the bacon was excellent, the creme fraiche failed to add any pizzaz to the rubbery pancake and the scrambled eggs were way too buttery (guess it comes with the territory at a 'french' restaurant). They need to fine tune their process as there was plenty of waitstaff and business was steady..."
286,"Save yourself from 2 hours in line and get brunch down the street at Venus instead! I had the worst brunch experience here at La Note. Not only did we wait an hour to be seated, we also waited close to an hour for our food to arrive. That's perfectly fine if they manage people's expectations well and try to make things better for the customers. Instead, they intentionally gave us wrong information about how long the waits would be. When we complained that we had been waiting for over 45 minutes for our food to arrive, the waitress tried to make us believe we were wrong. What?!"
287,"I wanted so badly to like La Note but I will never be back. The menu was wonderful. The backyard divine. The food was good. But the service left way too much to be desired. After over 40 minutes of waiting and still no food, I went up to a server and asked to speak to a manager since we were waiting 40 minutes for eggs and french toast and was told ""that's normal for us."" I still asked to see a manager. The manager walked over and said ""I'm sorry but they forgot to put your order in but it's still within the 'window of time' for food."" Irrelevant! Our food was never put in to the kitchen! After asking why 40 minutes is ""window of time for eggs and french toast"" the manager said ""it's a 70 seat restaurant and we have a tiny kitchen."" Really? Then downsize your tables! Anyway, we were offered a pastry as an apology to which we requested a ""pain au chocolat."" No offer of comping anything or get us free drinks by the way, as a normal restaurant would have. 5 minutes later the server comes back puts a croissant on our table and casually says ""on the house."" I stopped him as he turned and walked away and asked ""is this a pain au chocolat?"" ""No,"" he replied. ""We were out so here's a croissant."" That's just not acceptable. If you don't have the pastry that I asked for, ask me what I want as an alternative. Or offer another form of apology. Â Don't assume I want a croissant. That's not service. The food eventually came, now almost an hour after ordering it - outside the ""window of time"" - and after eating we asked for the check. The manager came by and asked how everything was. I commented that I found it rude that I was given a pastry I did not ask for just to shut me up. The manager said ""oh, that's my fault. sorry. What more can I do? You got your food 'within the window of time.' I can give you the name of the owner if you want to complain further and here are two coupons for coffee for our sister restaurant down the street if you want.""Ok, now look..if another table gets seated after us, eats, and leaves within my ""window of time' for food, then that's unacceptable. Comp us the drinks. Apologize and comp one of the meals. Do something. Don't give me a croissant I did not want, coupons for coffee for a different restaurant that I did not go to, and tell me to email the owner. What the hell kind of service is this? I will NEVER go back to La Note and I'll be sure that others don't either."
288,"Horrible service and only mediocre food.The ham and cheese omelette was good, but a bit undercooked. The emmentaler was also a bit bitter against the ham. Salting it a bit more would have helped.Pancakes are probably the best dish here. Very creamy and fluffy.Merguez is bought in and reheated badly. Skin was blistered and shrunken like leather.The food overall was quite good.Unfortunately, the wait and service were horrible. We were told 45 minutes and then waited for nearly twice that. We saw our waiter once, to order. Our drinks ran empty. We had to practically send a smoke signal to just get a coffee. The food took about an hour to just come out. The check was equally slow and the waiter was still not to be found except hovering and chatting a table he knew.Expect good food, long waits and horrible service."
289,"Cute and tasty, but horribly overpriced and disorganized. It may have been a bad day (Berkeley's graduation was today) but my group of 6 waited well over an hour for a table, and they let a group of 25 in ahead of us. Um, what?So after waiting, they finally get us in and everything on the menu is absurdly priced. I paid $15 for a brie and roasted tomato sandwich, and it was good, but I feel dirty. I just don't think that there is any reason to pay so much for a meal when there are plenty of really good, cheaper options around. For all its charm, I probably won't go back."
290,"if i wanted to not eat mediocre sf food i would come here , especially if you want to waste time waiting in line, waste money barting it here, eat soggy salad, and french baguette that is not buttery as advertised. another hyped place in the bay."
291,"I was here a couple months ago and the food was decent but the service was slow. I went back again, got the Ratatouille Omelette for breakfast and it took about an hour. It was also served with toast. When I asked for jam, the waittress just grabbed it off a table she had been cleaning, which had another customer's old spoon and jam in it. I think the water came about 30 minutes after we ordered.Overall, I think the food is unique and I would love to try it out more but the service is terrible. I'd rather go to somewhere with plain buttermilk pancake and eggs that prepares the food in 20-30 minutes."
292,The food is worth four stars.The service is atrocious. You wait to see a server. You may not get silverware unless you ask. The bill never shows up unless you ask explicitly. You leave the bill with your credit card prominently displayed and it is never picked up until you accost a server.The last three times we've went have all been the same. I don't even want to tempt you with descriptions of the food for fear you will go there and spend one and half hours on a quick lunch.
293,"The first time I dined at La Note, I came with a friend. Just the two of us on a Tuesday afternoon. Despite the fact that seating was plentiful, our waitress decided to seat us on the elevated platform of the window display.....the space was cramped to say the least. It was also unappetizing to see numerous dead flies around us due to lack of cleaning and upkeep. I decided a second chance was necessary after reading the numerous reviews on Yelp. It must have been a fluke...Today, I went to La Note to have a nice breakfast with relatives that are from out of the country. We were the first ones lined up at the door (around 7:40a.m) since we had a large party of 9. The problems started as soon as our drink orders were taken. When the waitress came back with our drinks, I told her that we were ready to order our food as well. Instead of taking our order, she proceeded to walk to every other table around us and take the orders of people who had literally just sat down. In case you think that i'm overreacting, she went around to FIVE other tables before strolling over to our table. Strike one.Shortly after we got our drinks, I asked another waitress for some hot water because the coffee was a bit too strong for my grandmother to drink. We received the hot water 30 minutes later when her coffee was no longer hot. Strike two.I just happened to glance over at the bar where one waitress proceeded to yawn with her mouth open wide enough to catch at least 500 flies, all while she scratched her head and rubbed her eyes free of crust. What happened next? She used those same hands to grab drinks that were ready to be served to customers. Strike three.And the food? It's just OK. The brioche pain perdu and lemon gingerbread pancakes were dry. Were they worth $12 a plate? Probably not. We also ordered omelets that were lacking in flavor. The two stars are for the Tartine Mistral. A nice crispy baguette, with tart goat cheese and sweet red peppers. I really wanted to like this place but it looks like it wasn't meant to be."
294,"I've been to La Note twice- and I'm giving it two stars due to the horrible service I received on both occasions. Â I used to be a server in college, so I'm generally pretty empathetic to hardworking employees at most restaurants. Â That said, I think you can get better food with better service at the similar prices at other area restaurants. Â My second time the restaurant also refused to honor a coupon from the east bay eco guide as written. Â The coupon offered 20% off our order excluding drinks but instead we were given 20% off one entree. Â When I politely inquired about it, the waitress could not have been more rude. Â The difference was only a few dollars, so I can definitely afford it, but I do believe establishments should honor their coupons as written, or at least not sass the customers for in good faith asking about the difference between what is promised and delivered. Â Next time I'll take my business elsewhere!"
295,"Mediocre food, i can make all of it a home and still a lot better. The service was OK, the waitress was nice but it took forever to get another round of drinks. We went for breakfast and it was pretty full and im like wow how exciting must be yummy food. Hek no it was so plain and just not all that. Maybe dinner here is different but the breakfast sucked. Sorry La Note .. lol.."
296,"the service is very slow, even when they are not crowded. No matter how good the food is if you have to wait for 40 minutes for your orders."
297,"Nice Provencale menu. No line when we went. Cafe au lait bowls were a nice touch. BUT service was just too bad to give more than 2 stars. Romantic Friday morning brunch with boyfriend turned ugly real quick when it took the waitress 30 minutes just to say hello after we were seated. One of those moments where all you can think is ""I'll just put down the menu and maybe she'll come over"" or ""Will anyone notice if I eat the banana in my purse right now?"" or even ""Do we have time on the parking meter for this?"". It was so bad the hostess kept apologizing. Also, a table seated after us got their food first! Not something I'd normally notice but we had spent so much time waiting that it really stood out. When it was time to go we were tempted just to leave cash on the table and head out for fear of sitting and waiting for anything else. Brunch should not leave you feeling this frustrated.Place is too understaffed. Maybe someone called in sick or something. Unfortunately, it's enough for us not to go back."
298,"I get that good breakfast places can draw a sizable line but mediocre ones?...Berkeley must be starved for good breakfast spots if La Note is any indication, based on the lines.Food, mediocre...Nothing really stood out although for a restaurant their coffee/espresso was actually impressive (And not being blue bottle).Service, meh...Our server was sweet, kind and apologetic but the overall service was pretty poor...We must've waited 40 minutes before we actually had our food arrive - it was remarkable really...Unfortunately, the food never made up for the service lacking.They seem to have a decent system for taking names down and getting people seated etc. but I would think the two bigger issues, food quality and service should at least be worthwhile in the end.Bay Area has plenty of great places for breakfast and after a 2nd try at this French wannabee, I definitely won't be back...Although, curiously, I suspect their lines will continue...Good luck Berkeley in unearthing some better breakfast places (Guerilla Cafe, for example, is A LOT better, IMHO)."
299,"This isn't my first time at La Note. I've been here countless times but this is the first time, service has been this bad for me and my friends.It's given that the wait was RIDICULOUSLY long. It was a Sunday and my friends and I (a party of 3 including myself) got there around 11am. We waited for about 1 hour before being seated. Then waited for another 45 min. for our food to come out. If I'm waiting that long for my food, it better be good. Unfortunately, the food was barely warm by the time it got to the table. Meaning, the food was already done but our waitress just didn't bring it to us. Our waitress, Lolo seemed nice at first, but her attitude and short-term memory ruined the mood for all of us. For example: I asked for a glass of water and waited for 20 minutes before I asked another waiter for it. And afterwards when I asked for a to-go box, same thing happened. I swear, Lolo needs to stop chitchatting in the corner and pay more attention to her customers. She was in charge of 4 tables that day. All the tables got free bread except for our table. And then the table next to us (a party of 4) came in later than us but got their food before we did. BEFORE WE DID!!!!I'm not saying the food wasn't good. It's good! But before you go... ask yourself.. Is it worth the wait?? The answer for me is no. If I'm going to wait that long for brunch, the food better be unforgettable. FYI: We were there for 2.5 hours - more than half of that was spent waiting for everything."
300,"My first time there was really nice. Â We'd moved into the neighborhood nearby and were excited to find ""our usual place."" Â My daughter and I have gone back four or five more times, either with friends or for Sunday breakfast. Â Each time has been worse and worse. Â The inside always feel damp and grungy. Â Service is slow.However, the last time was the final straw. Â We had just ordered and I noticed the waitress standing near the front door, slightly behind a small counter area. Â She took a napkin, wiped her hands on it, blew her nose, then removed her shoes and wiped the bottoms of her feet with THE SAME NAPKIN. Â She did not then wash her hands but promptly went back to serving. Â While I know a restaurant can't be responsible for every employee, c'mon! Â You talk to them about hygiene. Â This was it after trying in vain to like this place."
301,"I came here expecting awesome food and I got that but for what I had to go through, it wasn't worth it.I went with a friend and waited for an HOUR AND A HALF in the rainy, cold weather. I mean they told us that it would be 45 minutes, and I was like ok that's fine. A lot of people were already waiting and I really wanted to try it. But seriously an hour and a half is a bit much. Plus when we got seated inside, it was humid and hot which made it uncomfortable to eat a hot breakfast.Granted, they got the food to us fairly quickly and it was good, not amazing but good for brunch/breakfast."
302,"very RUDE hostessI went with my friend( 2 of us) and registered our name for 2 seats. Hostess told us to wait 20 mins. So, after 30 mins my friend asked her for the status and she told us that she missed our names in the list and told us to give the next available table. We waited(now we waited inside in front of the counter) for 45 more mins( also we reminded about our status 2 times during our wait) and after that we asked her about the status and she told us that she thought she already gave us a table...( really! then why would we be standing in front of you)!! And at the end we decided to leave the place and she didn't say anything!! felt very humiliating!!!"
303,"food great. service awfulllllllllll. i have waited and waited and waited here even once i've been seated the service is terrible. So, i started ordering to-go and bringing my brunch home as a way to avoid the hour and a half wait for eggs. Tried to pick up to go order today and i was told they're too busy for phone orders, can i call back later....How bout F*@# You La Note. Â I'm done giving money to people who don't appreciate their customers."
304,"My freind loves this place, so we went there before the Big Game.I had a fender bender on the way, so was late for the reservation. Â Of course they wouldn't sit my friend so she had to wait outside for an hour. Â And then the waiters gave bad attitude since I was late. Â First I was late for the Big Game, so wanted to get food and leave. Â Secondly, had to call insurance company, so was on the phone, put on hold on a Sunday morning. Â These a**hole waiters wouldn't come take our order even when we repeatedly asked them to, because, ""WE DO NOT TAKE ORDERS UNTIL YOU GET OFF THE PHONE."" Â WTH, this is only a brunch place. Â Words are extra, let's just say I lost all appetide and am not going back ever."
305,"Eh....it was just ok. Â I expected to be wowed by this place. Â There were people lined up outside waiting 1+ hrs just to eat here. Â It really was nothing to rave about. Â You'd think as a french cafe, they'd add a little spin to their oh-so-normal dishes. Â Maybe through in some truffled hollandaise in there or something. Â I mean really, how can you mess up eggs and cheese? Â The bread was good and fresh but that's about all I can say for this place. Â Oh and the cute little personal water jugs that they place on each table."
306,"Oh god, another one of these incredibly SHIT establishments that idiot Berkleyites just ADOOOOORE for its ""authentic"" French food and interior. Â I would be shocked that such a place exists in Berkeley, if I didn't know so many Berkeley residents. Â The thing is, it's really the kind of place that should only exist in the middle of nowhere in like Idaho or something, a place where a fancy night out involves the Olive Garden, Â some place where there isn't a fucking UNIVERSITY nearby, and supposedly educated, cultured people, and the fucking epicenter of the fucking foodie world just blocks away.This place is like Ici, in the sense that people like to come here just because there's always a line, and ipso facto, it must be fucking good. Â Unlike Ici, however, its food is incredibly bad. Â Seriously. Â BAD. Â But again, to these types of Berkeleyans, it doesn't really matter, because they don't know a burger made out of shit from a fucking meal made by fucking GOD. Â They just go because everyone else goes. Â The food is really fucking bad, seriously. Â And, I mean, anyone can make brunch taste good, right? Â Even I can. Â I'm not saying this food is bad for a restaurant. Â No, it's bad for food, period. Â The worst thing about this place isn't even their remarkably poor food, however, but the shockingly pathetic attempts at French on their menu and their grotesque and embarrassing version of French atmosphere. Â The calculated quaintness of this place is so heavy-handed, that it's really shocking that even Berkeley undergrads are taken in by it. Â It makes me want to projectile vomit. Â God, the fake French on the menu is enough to drive me to do-it-yourself lobotomy. Â But again, notice how many of the yelp La Note lovers can't help throwing in some of their own (shite) French. Â Look, I don't even like the French. Â I fucking can't stand them. Â But I'll take them over this place any day."
307,"I've heard so many good things about this place that I guess I had expectations. The food was fine, nothing special. My pasta dish was something that could have come from Olive Garden. They did have some good beers though."
308,Zero customer service! I wait at the to be seated sign for 5min. Nobody would come and greet. I asked a server if they have stopped taking customer since they are busy. She told me I would have to wait an hour and WALKED WAY! I guess I would have to get on the waiting list before the waiting start to count! Walking away does not make your customer to stay! Hope you continue to make a very good business.
309,"We had a terrible Â experience at La Note. We had reservations at 7:30pm and by 9:05pm we still did not have dinner. Â First they offered us a drink while we waited for our table, never got the drinks. We were seated and and we sat for 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order. We ordered a bottle of wine and told them not to bring us the previously ordered drinks. Â We also ordered the charcuterie/cheese plate and 2 entrees. Â we waited another 20 minutes for the appetizer when our waitress returned to tell us they were out of pate'. We said to substitute another meat. We then sat and waited for our entrees. We asked the hostess and waitress about our food and did not hear back. Â At 9:05 Â told them to forget the entrees, paid and left."
310,"This used to be one of our favorite breakfast/brunch spots. We always try to go on an early weekday morning to not have to deal with the wait or rushed service of the weekends. Our last visit was on a Wednesday morning and despite the fact that half the tables were empty, they could not get it together. My partner and I brought our child and we requested a high chair. The waitress showed us our table without a high chair and then proceeded to serve a bunch of other tables. All while we are struggling to hold our toddler in our arms. We have to ask for water from a blonde haired server, who barely looks us in the eye. We watch as other tables who came after us give their orders. After our waitress finally takes our order, we never see her again (until it is check time.) We watch as the large party next to us (and came long after us) get their coffees and teas, while still waiting for ours. I ask the blonde server again for our coffees, and again, she barely looks at us when she finally brings them. No one should ever have to feel like they are bothering the servers when asking TWICE for their water and coffee. The only person who gave us good service was the man bussing tables, who kindly set up our high chair and even got us our check. The service never used to be this poor. Ever. It is very disappointing. Eating out should feel like a treat, and not this stressful. I looove their lemon gingerbread pancakes and potatoes (which incidentally were half burnt this morning.) But it's simply not worth it. I'd rather go to Rick and Ann's."
311,"Went there for brunch on a Sunday morning. Â We knew it would be crowded and well aware that we would have to wait ~ 25 minutes to be seated. Â I told my wife my estimate was 35 minutes and I was right. Â The problem is that the waiter showed up 20 minutes after we were seated. Â Handed the menus and disappeared for another 18 minute well-counted. Â BTW extremely expensive for what we are being served. Â Average food, bad service, and pricy: Â 2 boiled eggs with thinly sliced toast and some fries for $10.95..."
312,"We went there two times - for lunch and for dinner. We were underwhelmed both times. The menu reads good, but tastes a bit bland, and for the money I'd rather go someplace else. Also, the ingredients were just not fresh tasting, especially the greens. Maybe I should've stuck with more simple dishes like an omlette - they seem to get good reviews here..."
313,"While the ingredients of ""authentic"" salade niÃ§oise are debatable, no salad bearing that name should ever be (1) too cold, (2) virtually undressed, (3) completely lacking in tomatoes, beans and onions/shallots, or have (4) corn and beets that taste canned, and (5) egg yolks boiled gray. Â And personally I thought the shredded carrots were tedious. Â To the staff, I recommend adding bacon bits, if constructing a decent salad is too great a bother."
314,"Based on the one time we were able to get in, our experience was that the outdoor seating/garden area is charming and lovely, but the breakfast vastly overrated. The poached pears on the much-touted lemon-gingerbread pancakes were tasteless (and a simple poached pear is supposed to be the mark of the French chef's skills). The Brioche Pain Perdu was raw in places and for all its fancy accoutrements (orange water batter, lavender honey) tasted like ordinary French toast. The service was poor; we got more attention from an industrious squirrel searching for nuts in all the flowerpots behind us. If it were easier to get in, I'd feel compelled to return to try the eggs and pastry; as it is, I think I'll stick with Venus (and their heavenly lemon-ricotta pancakes) just a few steps away."
315,"I have had pretty good experiences here for brunch, but I had dinner here the other night and it was a nightmare. Our waitress forgot my DP's starter salad, but then charged us anyway. When we asked her to take it off the bill she seemed annoyed with us. My salad came without dressing. Then my DP's pork chop was completely undercooked and gross. Our waitress ignored us the whole meal and we were just so disappointed."
316,"Ok after reading reviews about this I decided to try this place. We went there around 8 AM and wasn't that crowded..which I was happy about; but the happiness didn't last long as this family with their kid ruin everyone's morning. This kid just couldn't sit down, he wanted to run around the restaurant and people started to get annoyed....but none of the staff said anything to this family that your kid should NOT go under the table of other guest!!!!! Ok I can let this one go. Then we ordered our food (our waitress had so much attitude. (Still ok with me). My friend ordered his food with baguette. So 2 mins later the mean waitress come and said we don't have baguette. Ok we can let this one goes as well....then the food came like 30 min later...they are truly slow here ( let this one go as well)....and ok the portion for the price is for kids. The food tasted like I cooked it! Nothing special. The Pancake was very dry and thick! During the entire time we were sitting our waitress didn't even come to ask do we need anything.......we had to ask the other waitress (the blond girl with short hair) She was just so nice to attend our table. The one star is for her ONLY. So I can let go of all these: but when the bill came they charged us for a baguette (remember they didn't even have it) and they charged us for hot water (oh...how expensive is water). It wasn't huge charge total of extra $3, but it's a matter of principal! what a cheap owner and cheater! I will never want to go to a place that cheats their customers. So Stay away from this wanna be French restaurant that doesn't have anything resembling French culture and manner. French people are polite and honest. This place is a FAKE and a cheat."
317,"The food is okay, but in no way makes up for the *horrible* service we had. The waitress took 20 minutes to get coffee to our friends. The entire time she served us, we couldn't tell if she was stoned or just didn't care. Everything we asked for (like food or coffee or water) had to be asked for multiple times. My husband ordered a basket of pastries, and it was the last thing to come (by 10 minutes). And they weren't overwhelmingly busy.My friend ordered the Pain Perdu Au Chocolat, but for whatever random reason was told that it's not served on the weekends. Maybe they shouldn't put it on the menu then."
318,"I might have given this restaurant a great review if I had the fortune or misfortune to eat there. Â My family checked in around 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, July 24, 2011. Â There were many people waiting outside; however the waitlist didn't seem that long.At the time I wrote down our name for a party of 4 I asked the hostess how long did she suppose it might take for a table. Â She looked at me vacantly and said, ""oh, around 20 minutes."" Â After 20 minutes I checked in with her and she reassured me that we would have a table at any time. Â Then I checked with her after 40 minutes and she managed to ignore me. Â After an hour, I asked her why she didn't give me and my family a better estimate. Â Her excuse was that she had no way of controlling how quickly people ate.When I have eaten at other ""very popular and busy"" restaurants, I have been given an approximation of my wait time. Â I usually choose whether or not I will stay on the waitlist or remove my name according Â to the hostess's estimation.The hostest was inconsiderate, rude and, unfortunately, unable to gage the amount of time which tables turn. Â The place may have good food but the hostess was completely incapable. Â Others had the same feeling about her."
319,"I wouldn't consider this place romantic or classy at all. Candles on a bunch of crammed-in tables doesn't equate to classy or romantic. There was a guitarist playing some tunes, which could potentially be considered romantic, but his songs weren't very impressive or skilled. I wanted to take his guitar and show him how to really play. The food was decent, but way overpriced. The environment was pretty loud from the customers. The bathrooms were flooded too."
320,"I give it 2 stars because the first time I came, the service and food were good. Not amazing but good enough to come back. Â The second time I went (last weekend) pretty much guaranteed that I would not be back. Â Service was terribly slow. It took exactly an hour for the pancakes to come out and when they did they were bland, thick, and lukewarm. Â The potatoes were cold and old. I sent those back when the waitress looked our way again 15 minutes later and the waitress traded my cold potatoes for lukewarm potatoes. Â Eventually I got up to serve myself condiments, syrup, water, and ask for more coffee at the bar because the waitress just never bothered to check on us. Â I won't be going back there."

322,"The food is unique i can give them that, taste is good. I don't even mind waiting if there is a long line, that is not their fault and not much you can do if you have 30 people wanting to come in and you only have seating available for 25. some do still have to wait. The main reason for my 2 star rating Â is very poor customer relations. no smile, missing condiments, bland interaction of wait staff, after being seated waitress took a good 15 minutes to attend to our orders. If I hadn't called her attention(the adjoining table was attended to before us even though we came in before them), it might have taken another 15 minutes.I expected more for the amount of money they're charging at this place. part of the dining experience is customer service which is a biggie on my part. otherwise i would just order take out or delivery and eat at home. there are other nice places in Berkeley that have far friendlier wait staff than this place, i am really disappointed, i certainly wouldn't be coming to this place for quite some, maybe in a few months or years hoping that the staff may have realized the importance of SERVICE."
323,"had the longest wait EVER. i was there on a Sunday morning and waited for more than two hours. the hostess wasn't very helpful in the sense that when we asked her how long the wait is, she said, ""just wait."" there were 3 of us, but we were seated at a tiny table for two. waitress forgot two of our coffees until half an hour later. food was not very memorable either... it is a cute little place, but the wait just isn't worth it. Bette's Oceanview Diner (Berkeley) has much better pancakes or Pastis (Palo Alto) has much better ambiance and service."
324,"No matter how good the food is, unless it's a type of food that's meant to be eaten without utensils I want utensils.Last time I was in France, they used the same basic silverware we use here in the good ole' USA........La Note didn't get the memo.This is the only place I have ever been served food [eggs, bacon and toast] and told that there wasn't any clean silverware, and they would bring me some as soon as it was ready........m'kay..........That's just the sort of thing that means you won't get a second chance from me."
325,"This place came to me highly recommended and, from the crowd, it seemed like quite the place. I was told to order the oatmeal as I am a huge fan of oatmeal.Well, the food was OK. The oatmeal was kind of chewy and after trying their blueberry oatmeal, I've decided that I don't like fruit in my oatmeal.So I gave them another shot, and next time I ordered their creme fraiche pancakes. These, too, were OK. They were no better than Denny's pancakes with fancy cream on top.So for having OK food they would get 3 stars, but for charging too much and making we wait so long, they lose a star.All in all, I'd suggest getting your breakfast elsewhere. This place is way overrated."
326,Soooo....my cousin and I came here for breakfast today. The wait was over an hour! I figured the place must be pretty popular and the food must be good since there were over 20 other people waiting. We finally got seated after being told twice the wait was going to be 15 more minutes. I ordered the pain perdu and the rosemary potatoes and my cousin ordered the creme pancake which was under cooked. All and all I cant say that I would be coming back as the food was only mediocre and the service wasnt that great :(
327,up scale french style and Food is good but Â aggressive and Â rude Â floor manager ruined my Sunday Brunch (he is the bald guy) ... Â  prices aren't that great either. I am not going back anytime soon.
328,"i have been to la note dozens of times over the years and the service seems to get worse and worse. Â i used to put up with it because i love the food and the patio atmosphere so much, but i don't think i'll be going back. they served me rotten tomatoes--i'm guessing they thought i wouldn't notice because they were ""roasted"". Â the waiter visited our table exactly twice; once to take the order (after an initial 20 minute wait) and lastly to deliver the check. Â he completely ignored us even though the restaurant was nearly empty. Â uggh, i'm just through with this place. Â there are so many excellent waiters and waitresses in the bay area. Â i don't know why management continues to staff the place with inattentive snobs."
329,"We read the reviews on line and had to try this place. Overall review: Â food was eh, service pretty bad. Â We arrived at 11 left at 1:30...not because we were enjoying ourselves on the patio. Â After an hour wait we were finally seated. Â While we were waiting to be seated we took a look at the menu so we could order right away. Â  Oncer we were seated the waitress showed up right away and we were ready to order. Â They brought our coffee right away...but forgot one coffee. Â Our friend said that he didn't mind so we let that slide. Â We were a group of 7 and chatted quite a bit passing time while waiting for our food. Â Then we realized it had been quite a while since we ordered. Â  Taking a look at the time we realized that it had been 45 minutes since we ordered! Â  The food finally arrived an hour after we ordered. Â But they got one of the entrees completely wrong. Â We sent it back and reminded them of the correct order. Â They promised it would be just a few minutes. Â  Well, the food arrived after another 20 minutes. Â And it was just ok. Â An open omelet with potatoes and carmelized onions. Â  Eh. Â  Just ok. Â  The wait staff was very apologetic about the mix up and the wait. Â  They promised it would be taken off the bill. Â Of course the bill (which showed up promptly) arrived incorrect. Â  They didn't take off the entree or the coffee that never showed up. Â  More apologies. Â Overall not a place we'll go to again. Â Too bad."
330,"No matter how good the food is, it's not worth waiting twice as long as you're told and untimely service."
331,"Living in sf, you get used to the ridiculously long wait time for brunch. You're actually relieved with anything under an hour wait. What you're not used to is finally getting seated, placing your order, and waiting another 45 damn minutes for your food to come out, as well as having your waitress disappear that entire time. The food we got was good but basic, except the potatoes were cold and dry and tasted like leftover home fries. The lemon gingerbread pancakes everyone raves about tasted like gingerbread with no hint of lemon whatsoever. We got to the restaurant at 10:30 and didn't leave the restaurant until 1:00. That only includes about 20 minutes of actual eating time. We had to wait another 15 minutes after we finished eating for our disappearing waitress who never returned, until finally another waitress actually got us our check and took care of our bill. Management needs to get things in order. We noticed another table who was seated 20 minutes before us still hadn't gotten their food while we were halfway through our meal. Surprise surprise, they had the same disappearing waitress."
332,"Maybe it's because I had high expectations, but i was sorely disappointed. Â we went for dinner and waited a while to order. Â After ordering, the food took a long time to finally come. Â when it did come, they got an order wrong. Â the person who got the wrong order, then waited a long time to get his correct order. Â one person also ordered the penne past but was served the bowtie. Â when she asked for red pepper flakes, the server looked at her like she had rabies and said they don't have any. Â meanwhile, the waitress was mostly MIA and never checked in on us.the food was decent but nothing special, especially for the price. Â they then took forever to give us our check. Â they included an 18% gratuity despite the menu stating the gratuity added on checks for parties more than five would be 15%. we then waited and waited for the waitress to pick up the credit card. Â I'm never going back"
333,"I was disappointed with the service at La Note. I went for brunch for the first time, I was told there was a 20 minute wait and it ended up being 60 minutes wait, too much. I understand it is an estimated time, although it should not take 3 times longer. Then it took another 15 min for someone to take the order. The food was alright. The french toast and pancakes were really good, but the scrambled eggs and omelette were nothing to rave about. The menu does not have a lot of eggs/omelettes options.The place is small with tables too close.I had been there before, for diner, and even though it Â was long time ago, i remember it was not a great experience eitherOverall, not a great experience and certainly not worth the wait."
334,"I came here for brunch on Sunday. My friend put her name down around 11:45, and since the host said it was a 30-45 min wait, we decided to head to Philz for coffee. We got back around 12:15. My friend went in to check to see if they called her name. They did not, so we waited right next to the door. We saw her come in and out many times for the next 20 minutes, but did not hear her call us. After 20 minutes, we decided to check on the wait time, and found out that she supposedly called us. I swear she didn't....i stopped my conversation to wait for her to call out the name since I was starving. Anyways, after a long wait, we were seated around 1ish. I ordered the Cafe Nord (eggs with goat cheese on bread, side of roasted tomatoes and red potatoes), and my friend ordered the Brioche Pain Perdu (french toast). The food wasn't anything special, especially after a long wait. . Our waitress was friendly. Service is a bit slow. Â Would i go back? probably not. I didn't like the food enough to want to wait that long."
335,"My friends and I came to have some breakfast. Everything seemed to go well. Then mid-way eating my potato and onion omelet (like about half done), i crunched on some dirt or sandy-like substance (like the ones you might find in some seafood or not-thoroughly-washed veggies). My friends kept telling me I should complain or at least mention it to the waitress. When the waitress came by, my friend mentioned about my food having something dirty in it. Instead of apologizing, the waitress gave us this snotty tone and told us something that pretty much says ""I don't believe what you guys are saying"" and maybe ""you're probably trying to grab free food"". We didn't want another omelet, and the whole conversation upset my friend who was paying the bill, so she didn't tip them. However, on the way back to my apartment, my friend who paid the bill realized she left her cell phone in the restaurant and went back to get it. When she got in, I think another waitress (my friend said it wasn't the waitress that served us) waved my friend's receipt in front of her saying ""this isn't cool and it's insulting"". With some lecturing about tipping, my friend had to argue that they upset her and me when we tried to point out something with the food and thus she had a right to not tip (it was her money and her choice). I guess in the end they still thought we were being rude and/or unfair since my friend came out hating the place for good. Even if the food was decently good (aside from the dirt/sand), their way of treating us is definitely not what I think a good, professional restaurant should do. I believe it should be the customer's choice whether or not they want to tip, and customers shouldn't be judged their worth even if they're wearing really casual clothes (not sure if this was a factor but my friends and i just wore whatever we first grabbed in the closet). If you do go to this restaurant, expect to tip, even with bad service, and possibly be judged on how well you're dressed."
336,"Sorry. Both stars are for the food. Everything tasted good. Jam is tasty. We know there's a long wait. No problem. We put our names in and browsed at the the bookstore next door. I love the French cuisine and used to live in Paris. But service in Paris is 10 times better than this. The waitstaff was missing in action. 20 minutes to order. Brunch took close to 2 hours, and we got 1 refill of coffee. Second cup was burnt.Absolute worst part of the experience was the hostess. We were seated right by the door on a cold, windy day. Two of my companions were freezing. I had a warm wool coat. To be nice to my companions, I asked the hostess to please not hold the door open while she called people outside since we were seated in a wind tunnel. She said yes, but looked at me like I'd kicked a puppy. Then she proceeded to hold the door as wide as it would open while looking over her shoulder to shoot me death stares throughout of our meal. Our coffee got cold. Our food got cold. We were shivering. Coats stayed on the whole meal. I would not return, and I would not send anyone else to pay for a terrible dining experience no matter how good the food. I'm not sure I'd be any good at customer service, but I don't do it for a living either. If you insist on going, keep in mind that the staff doesn't care about you and acts like they don't want you there at all. You'll have a better meal if you're prepared for that."
337,"I recently went to La Note. I tried their Creme Fraiche pancakes with bacon and eggs along with their fried eggs with sausages. The meal was mediocre to slightly bland. Its not something I recommend and after having to wait awhile, it was a pretty big disappointment. Several people had raved about this place, but I honestly thought the best part was the bacon. But then again, when is bacon ever not good?"
338,"I so want to like this place. The decor is sweet, outdoor patio lovely, great menu.... BUT the service is slow and indifferent, food is not that fresh and often cold e.g. Cold home fries, cold pancake... The blueberries served with the ginger pancake are frozen and tasteless even though we are in Berkeley in the summer! Venus down the street does not have the same ambiance, but service is great and the food is fresh, local and delicious."
339,"After reading all the great reviews and looking over the fabulous photographs, I couldn't wait to come out and enjoy Mother's Day Brunch. Â  We had tried to make reservations but were informed no reservations for holidays. Â I thought it would be a little tricky with my 22 month old son, but was willing to give it a try. Â We arrived at 8:45am on Sunday behind a packed line of excited patrons. We got on the list and were told ""...about an hour...maybe 45 minutes."" Â We took our buzzer and headed to the local coffee shop to get a cup of joe while we waited. Â Of course my toddler started to melt down and thank goodness I'd packed some cheerios and other snacks. Â We were actually seated an hour and a half later. Â Keep this in mind if you have a toddler! Â We watched a party of 2 that had arrived 15 minutes after us initially, leaving the restaurant with bellies full almost 30 minutes before we were even seated. Â About 10 minutes after we were seated we heard the host comment that to different patrons that they were out of high chairs.Now the reviews had said to expect a wait and I did expect one but not quite as long as it took.As for the food, nothing exciting to write about. Â My scrambled eggs were half cooked and the pancakes were overcooked and dry. Â The delicious fruit bowl they mention on their brunch menu on the website? Â Apparantly, they don't serve it on the weekend. Â So.......my toddler who is allergic to eggs, enjoyed the yogurt and raspberry coulis. Â Thank goodness we ordered it because I needed something to give a little flavor to my blah pancakes. Â Now, my husband ordered his normal, 2 eggs, bacon and the roasted potatoes and his meal was the best of the bunch. Â The roasted potatoes were delicious! Â But, I'm really not too excited to wait for 1 1/2 hours on a Sunday morning, chasing a screaming toddler, just for some roasted potatoes. Â There's gotta be a better deal."
340,"What seemed like a stroke of great luck on a busy Sunday morning turned out to be a grumpy breakfast that left us all feeling BLAH. After scoring parking right up front and bypassing a group of people waiting, we got seated the instant we walked in. (6ppl!) After a long night of partying this place looked great. The menu is interesting but the food isn't tooo different. Our waitress was not the friendliest person. It took about an hour for our food to arrive and when it did, it didn't blow us away. I had 2 eggs, toast and homefries. The homefries are OK only b/c I'm not used to rosemary and garlic for my first meal of the day. For some reason it seemed to overwhelming. The coffee wasn't great either. For the price I think I would have rather gone to a much humbler diner like all you knead on haight!"
341,"1 hour + wait when there are easily 2-3 empty tables at all times, waiting to be serviced. This place need to get it's act together, work on scheduling, organizing and making it easier to get a table. Food is good, but not excellent."
342,Did not meet expectations and hype. Food and drinks were average.
343,"This was my second trip to La Note and one that has made me question all the rave reviews here on Yelp. The food here is really hit and miss. They were out of the steak so we opted for the French sausage with frites. As anyone who has ever been to France will attest, authentic French sausage is something the French take very seriously.....NOT in La Note. What appreared on our plates for a whopping $16.50 was something more similar to a cheap, nasty $3 dollar hot dog that you would find in some less celebrated establishment. It was truly awful. The charcuterie and fromage starter was perfectly fine, the terrine was delicious and the cheese was of generous portions.My friend fared better with the chicken bagnat and comiserated with the woeful ""hot dog"" mess that sat on our plates! Will I return to La Note? Probably not....Which is a shame cos I wanted to enjoy the food here but alas not enough for me to part with $16.50 for a very disingenuous excuse for a main course!"
344,"Went here for a Sunday Brunch. Â We had about a 30 minute wait for a table. Â The parking was scarce and we had to keep feeding the parking meters while we were there. It was Â A little difficult to enjoy our food, when we kept worrying about the time expiring on the parking meter. Â We got sat outside and luckily it was a nice day. Â The food was average and nothing really out of the ordinary. Â Our server came by twice, once to take our order and another time to drop the bill. Â It was a bit to pricey for the level of service and food we got. Â I think next time we will eat elsewhere."
345,"i've been here many times for breakfast and brunch, and not once have i had a good experience. why do i keep going back you ask? because everyone else seems to love it. why, i really don't know, maybe it's the fancy french names to describe american diner food. or maybe it's the hot, but completely inadequate, servers.today at breakfast for instance:empty restaurant, we wait over and hour for our food. server says: ""yeah it takes a while here...""sorry, but that's not a valid excuse for taking that long to poach some eggs. food comes out completely messed up, eggs are overcooked, salad is over-dressed (i asked for dressing on the side), waitress forgets about our orders, never comes by to check on us. i had to chase her absent minded hippie face down two times.the food is nothing special or interesting. i heard that the executive chef here pilfered all the recipes from another sf restaurant. *venus* down the street is leaps and bounds better on food and service.all three of us left angry and disappointed, and not least because they charged us for a cup of hot water. you can take your l'eau chaude and shove it up your franÃ§ais cul."
346,"We came in on a weekday and made reservations. We didn't have to wait long to get seated but we sat there for over 1hr waiting for our food...no exaggeration. Not coming here again. I got the poached pear and lemon Ginger pancakes. Thumbs down..flat, bland and poached pears tasted it was out of a can?! Â Supposedly there was a new chef and waitress was apologizing to us for the long wait because they had a new chef. I dint see what the big deal is with the food, I've had much better in other places in Berkeley!"
347,"everyone raves about this place and I have eaten there 2 times and never ever thought it was good. Sigh. I want to be happy with the rest of the world. but it just isn't that good. i had french toast and it was aiight. i could imagine better. The food was really just didn't have that ""yum"" factor.... I wish i could try it more times, but they took all my money. lol. it's pricey."
348,"There, I had 2 expensive so-so semi-French dinner with bad wine and 1 expensive, bland tasting American brunch. Then GOD created Yelp and I gave the place 2 stars. Please forgive me my Lord for I am French myself, know what to expect and how much I should pay for it."
349,"We had the Bouillabaisse Marseillaise and the Poulet Ã¡ la NiÃ§oise for dinner. Both were surprisingly bland. With all the fish and seafood in a bouillabaisse, plus the rouille, I expected lots of flavor. Totally bland. Perhaps the kitchen was having an off night. Decent service at least. I guess I'll have to try the brunch since it seems so many like that. Maybe."
350,everyone loves La Note... so I guess I had too high expectations... or maybe order wrong foods. Â  I had better brunch at so many other places. Â and services were not that great either... and too crowded.
351,"I like it, though I have had several experiences at the door with the host. No greeting, and sometimes not even an acknowledgement... it seems the hostess is almost avoiding the customers. Recently i had visited the restaurant by myself, i realize maybe that seating one person isn't as exciting as seating 3 or more, the hostess had told me that the wait would be quit a while 40 minutes (which seemed excessive for just one).I said ok, i was hungry but i do love the wonderfully spicey lamb sausage enough to want to wait. I came back after going to get a cup of coffee, just to check in and she had crossed me off the list. I don't understand what that was about, either she had outragously misquoted a wait time to deter me from dinning there possibly to make her job easier, or I missed a sudden open table for one. either way in that moment the Hostess was sweet appologized very sincerely and offered to seat me right away. Â No thanks."
352,"Sadly, my poached eggs, toast, and grilled tomatoes were cold when they arrived at my table. Â I was at the restaurant at 1:55pm, Â so it wasn't exactly busy. Â But it took a LONG time before the waitress brought my order to the table--.she disappeared for awhile and my guess is she forgot about my order (she may have been out in the patio, but I don't there were many people back there). Anyway, she insisted on giving me a 20% discount which was nice...but I still had a lousy dining experience."
353,"My friends and I waited for an HOUR and STILL did not get seated here on a Sunday morning, so I can't speak about the quality of their food. Granted, we were a party of 6... but the staff members could be brighter. Â The guy told us to keep waiting for another party of 6 to finish at their table... yet repeatedly we saw tables of 2 and 4 get up a leave, where the tables were near each other. Â I can't understand why he couldn't put the two tables together. Â Perhaps he doesn't realize that 2+4=6?!!"
354,"If I could give 0 stars for service I would. I'm sure the food is great, but apparently they were ""unable"" to allow me to place a reservation for my grandparents -- who cannot wait on lines or stand outside for long periods of time due to health issues. Too bad for La Note, we will definitely be going elsewhere."
355,"I have never eaten here and in a moment you'll know why they'll never get my business. On fine saturday morning, me and three of my buddies decided to have brunch reunion at La Note. It was a sunny day, and they had a long wait. They told us it'll be 45 minutes. We said no problem and since the weather was nice, just hung out, enjoying the weather. About 50 minutes later, we were called and told our table is ready. Excited, and really hungry by now, we enter the restaurant as our hostess begins to lead us to our table. Just then, someone interrupts our hostess and tells her that they were giving our table to a bigger party, a party of six. While we had been hanging out, we had indeed noticed that this party of 6 had arrived about 10 minutes before we were told that our table is ready. Obviously, we protested but were told that since we were only four, and they were six, they get priority. We were really pissed by now. They told us, quite unapologetically, that we will have to wait a little bit more. We walked out , hungrier and very very angry. They not only spoilt our day, but lost 4 customers and probably more. I have heard great things about their food but there are plenty of really nice restaurants in the neighborhood where I can take my business. Au revoir, au diable avec vous, la note!"
356,"I kept hearing how this place was AMAZING. But it fell flat. I got their cheese omlette as well as their raspberry oatmeal pancakes. I had high expectations that were barely met. The waitress was pretty sweet, but she didn't even refill my coffee when I asked her twice. It was alright, but too over priced and too much of a wait for their food. Just not worth it really. Sorry La Note. -_-"
357,"I placed a to go order at La Note for the Lemon-Gingerbread pancakes with Poached pears based on the photo I saw on Yelp. When I arrived home at first I thought they gave me the wrong item but they were indeed the pancakes I ordered. Â They had no poached pears, no powdered sugar, they were soggy because they were undercooked and to top it off they only gave me one small ramekin of syrup, enough for one pancake (I had an order of 3 pancakes). Â The pancakes had an average flavor . After tip my pancakes cost me $18.00 and that was without a beverage. Â I feel like I was robbed. Â I want my money back. I rarely get that feeling when I go out to eat. Â I will Â never eat at La Note again."
358,"I will start off saying that the lemon ginger pancakes and pain perdu with lavender honey are something special, as well as their roast potatoes. But the wait to get in to this restaurant is waaaay too long (- 2 stars). On multiple weekend visits i have had to wait over 1 hour in what i would consider non-peak times (11am and later). Â So if you dont mind standing around on a sidewalk in Berkeley for an hour then you should try La Note. Otherwise your time would be better spent living your life :)"
359,"Shining Reputation = Low Standard SwillI am so sad that I have to leave a terrible review for La Note. Â I've dined here many times in the past for breakfast/lunch and always enjoyed both the service and the meal. Â It's been almost a year since I've been back and after deciding to take my parents out for brunch, unfortunately, I have never felt so let down by a restaurant (especially one with a reputation like La Note.Let's start with the atrocious service. Â Now I'm used to waiting a good 40 minutes, no problem I, enjoy pre-meal conversation. Â However, we were one of first people to be seated on the terrace but someone had to sit for over an hour while other people with larger parties received their food first. Â The worse part was, the food kept coming out at different times so we couldn't eat our meal together. Â When I asked for silver ware (because the busboy had forgotten to set it), I received a set with old spinach remnants still clinging to the knife and greasy stains on the spoon. Â I politely asked if I could have a clean set of silverware, the busboy decided that he would take his sweet time clearing off the table of the party that just left before he could bring me clean fork. Â  Mind you this whole time, my pancake is sitting in front of me happily getting colder and I had to sit for ten minutes before I finally got a decent fork and knife that didn't look like it was being used to floss someone's teeth after a pesto dinner. Â And then the pancake. Â Dear god, like most people, the lemon gingerbread pancake has been my absolute favorite thing on the menu at La Note. Â It was untouchable, always delicious. Â I'm not even sure how to describe the cement-like gelatinous half-cooked gloop called a pancake that was put in front of me. Â The initial taste is sort of what you expect-lemony and full of ginger...not so bad...then comes the aftertaste. Â I literally had to spit it out it tasted so bitter. Â Sort of how I imagine clay would taste. Â I suspect someone accidentally through an extra cup of baking soda into the mix. Â Just awful. Â When the spacy waitress (who by the way not once apologized for confusing our orders and making us wait for over an hour to eat) asked me if I wanted a box Â for the pancake, I looked her straight in the eye and said, ""Absolutely Not. This isn't worth taking home.""So sorry La Note. Â You were the apple of my eye a year ago and now you've simply fallen from grace."
360,"This review has nothing at all to do with the food at La Note, which is generally very good. It is about the service, which I am guessing has also a lot to do with the management of the restaurant. In the past two years, I've come here for business lunches as well as for dinner and brunch. Four times out of five, generally during the lunch hour, service is DISMAL. Once last year, at lunch with two colleagues, my order (a burger!) showed up 1/2 hour later than my lunch companions' orders AND it was cooked rare when I ordered medium. By the time it came back cooked better, it was time for us to go. Two other times, service was so unbelievably slow and the wait person unbelievably unresponsive, I vowed never to come back. But today another colleague and I decided to lunch there (we were both after the charcuterie plate, which is quite good); we decided to risk it. We got there at 12:25; the room was busy but not packed. I had to flag the hostess down after fifteen full minutes because our waitress had yet to show herself to us. Once we'd ordered, it wasn't until 1:10 that our charcuterie plates arrived. I had to beg another server for (at least) bread because we were starving. While we were waiting, I noticed other diners searching the room in vain for their waitperson. Our waitress was nice enough; however, I found it irritating when she came back to say our lunches were being prepared and ""it had only been twenty minutes...I timed it."" She hadn't factored in the first fifteen minutes we'd been sitting there completely ignored. Secondly, when she finally brought our orders, along with a basket of bread, she said, ""Oh, I guess it's nice to have two bread baskets..."" having seen the first basket of break I'd begged for. NOTE that the charcuterie plates require no cooking!!!I've noticed that the dinner waitstaff is generally much better; I've not had the lousy service at dinner (nor at weekend brunches) that my friend and I had today. (If you go there at lunch, I'd do everything in my power to NOT have the waitress whom I call ""Eyeliner"" serve you. You'll regret it. AND I WILL NEVER GO THERE FOR LUNCH AGAIN, which is too bad, because the food is good."
361,They do not accept substitions. Asking for an egg to be cooked a certain way is considered a substitution. Nuff said.
362,"People rave about this place, and I've only been once now, but I wasn't impressed with the food for the price. Â We had brunch for three and the check was $55 before tip, and we didn't order anything particularly excessive - omelets, sausages, potatoes, coffee. None of which were particularly special or particularly better than what you can get for half the price any number of other places. Add in an hour wait and the cramped, noisy dining room - both of which would be fine if the food was spectacular - and it makes for an unsatisfying & expensive experience.That says nothing about dinner, and I suspect I would've enjoyed even a sandwich from their lunch menu better than the omelet, but I can only review what I experienced."
363,"Oh how I wanted to love this place. Â We are in Berkeley for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary. Â I looked to yelp to help guide us to a good French restaurant. Â We cancelled reservations at two other highly regarded restaurants to choose La Note as it is walking distance from our hotel and it got such great reviews. Â What a bad decision. Â When we first arrived at 8:15 for an 8:30 res.we were ignored for a very long time as we stood by the front host stand. Â There were bussers and servers passing by, but noone even acknowledged us. Â After 3 or 4 minutes, the host came over and got our name, etc. Â My husband requested a table in the front by the window and she said it had been reserved already. Â Then a party of 3 came in behind us and she sheepishly offered them that table, although it was clear that they hadn't actually reserved it, she just felt she should offer it to them first since their res. was for 8:15. Â Fair enough. Â When we sat down we were ignored again for a very long time. Â Our server was SO casual - not at all interested in giving good service, just bringing the food to the table. Â We looked over our menus but I quickly settled on the the bouillsbaisse because that is something I rarely order and I saw many people had it on their tables, must be good. Â When she finally came over to take our order, she informed me they were out of that. Â Now, as a good server, you would go and immediately tell your newly seated tables if you just ran out of something BEFORE they order, especially something like your signature dish. Â I was really disappointed and thought about leaving, but by now it was after 9 and I wasn't sure if we would find another table easily. Â So I ordered the mussels and my husband ordered the flat iron steak and frites. Â I asked if the mussels could be done in a bouillabaisse style, and she said yes. Â The food came out in a timely manner, but my husband's food was cold. Â My dish was totally flavorless, the broth tasted like water. Â There was tons of raw garlic and onions and tomatoes in the broth, but I think it was lacking butter or something that gives that dish a richness I am accustomed to. Â I ate my food but my husband had to send his back to be warmed up. Â When it returned and he took a few bites, he saw that it was blood rare in the middle. Â He had ordered it Med. Rare. Â So, he had to send it back again. Â I thought the shellfish in my dish was generous, however it was truly bland and forgettable. Â As I read these reviews tonight I realize we should have stuck with breakfast. Â Our server did take my husband's steak off of the bill, but had she let us know they were out of what I was going to order we could have cut our losses right then and eaten somewhere else. Â Near the end of the meal the busser was walking around with a bus tub almost throwing the dishes and glasses from all of the empty tables in the tub and clanging them all around so loudly it was unbelievable. Â He was acting as if there weren't customers in the restaurant. Â The rest of the staff were drinking wine and some had started eating at a table in the back with friends while we were having our dessert. Â It was so unprofessional, I was astounded. Â I guess if I was looking for a dining EXPERIENCE, I should have kept our reservations at Chez Panisse. Â I just wanted some real authentic french food and I think the chef is on vacation. Â Epic fail."
364,"If you are looking for a breakfast place with good savory food this is NOT the PLACE. I was in town from Chicago and was directed to La Note for breakfast. My wife and I asked what were specialties the mentioned their breads and pancakes and specialty omelette's. Well the small selection if omelette's was weak with ingredients like tomatoes, feta, and herbs not really what I am looking for in an omelet so we opted for the raspberry and lemon gingerbread pancakes Â with a bread basket (one type of basket was out so we ordered the original. Bread Basket- Brioche: Fine pretty basic it was warm which was nice, cinnamon toast: again OK if they made this a french toast I would get it but as a cold bread mediocre at best, croissant: how a french place can serve a cold croissant with no buttery flavor at all is horrible. Raspberry Pancakes: horrible, dry flavorless, besides the unbelievably sugary raspberry spread on top worse than IHOP I give this dish an F-, Lemon Gingerbread Pancakes- ok gingerbread makes pancake more cakey than usual but still pretty bad- D+, Overall, Service- C, Atmosphere-C, Bread Basket-C, Raspberry Pancake-F-, LG Pancake- D+, Overall- D how people would ever wait in line here is beyond me."
365,"We decided to go to La Note for the first time after hearing some great reviews. Â The food is good, however the speed of service was terrible. Â Two other guests came in and got a table 20 minutes after we did and they got their bill before us! Â I'll probably give La Note another shot to see if it was a fluke."
366,"i knew when i ate here the first time that i wouldn't enjoy coming back the second time.the cafe is cute, the ambiance is very french (although i've never been to france, i imagine that la note embodies it fairly well), and the menu is interesting.however, i don't really like their food, or they way they cook stuff. yeah. it's just not my style. first off, it's expensive. secondly, everything is named in french. i hate trying to order things that i can't even pronounce.breakfast for 3 cost us more than $40 including tip. not to mention, they didn't give us our full order. my friend ordered sausage with his meal, and they didn't give it to him. yet they still charged us. lame.the potatoes were burnt and the toast wasn't even toasted.remind me never to come back here again. it's just not worth ""giving a try"" anymore."
367,"This is a comment about La Note's service only. Â It has been years since I had a quiche, and I was really craving it on Saturday during our food excursion in Berkeley. Â We just finished snacking at Yogurt Harmony and thought we were lucky to stumble upon this French cafÃ©. Â I wanted a quiche to take home. Â After we entered, the hostess warmly greeted us and directed us to the bar to order take out. Â Service went downhill from there. Â Once we arrived at the bar, the 2 waitresses standing around the kiosk promptly left to help their tables so we waited for the bartender to help us. Â The waitresses and bartender didn't even give us a look of acknowledgment. Â Perhaps I suffer Middle Child Syndrome, but at least pretend like you see us standing there! Â All I ever wanted was to be noticed! Haha. Â No seriously though, we were standing there for at least a minute before the bartender said ""I'll be right with you."" Â She didn't even glance our way when she said it. Â Finally after a few more minutes of opening and pouring wine, she addressed our existence. Â I had just a simple question and simple order. I asked if they still had quiche. Â She didn't know so she asked a waitress. Â We left there empty handed and a little miffed at the poor service. Â It really isn't hard to give decent service. Â What ever happened to friendly service with a smile? I don't think I'll ever try La Note...even if the quiche was good.One star for being clean and cute in Berkeley. Â Another star for the nice hostess."
368,"If you want to be ignored or sneered at by your server, then this is your place!! With a line out the door and several empty tables inside, this place sends mixed messages. Having seen some great reviews, we decided to give it a shot. Our non-existent server finally showed up to our table after we'd been seated for 10 minutes. She looked like she smelled something terrible and blandly demanded ""Ready to order."" After rudely correcting our poor pronunciation of some menu items she disappeared into oblivion. Another server appeared with my boyfriend's oj within a few minutes and dropped it off with a smile. My coffee......??? After I watched 3 tables around me flag down other servers to help them, I was finally able to find my server again to re-request my coffee. I love waiting for 20 minutes for lukewarm coffee served with a sneer. As we watched the food land on 2 tables around us that had been seated a few minutes after us, we finally flagged our server again to inquire as to our food. (Mind you that this is literally 25 minutes after we had ordered. Eggs and toast, people) She seemed a bit disgusted to have to pause to throw out ""It's coming"". When the food finally did arrive a few minutes later it was plunked in front of us without a word from our server. The girl who helped her get the food out seemed more concerned than the one that was expecting a tip. I requested a coffee refill. (This would have made it my 2nd cup. 1 served and one refilled. Not a lot to request from a breakfast server, if you ask me.) Unfortunately, this appeared too much for the poor girl. When she passed my table for the 4th time with no coffee (at this point we had been out of water for 10 minutes as well) I finally got up and went to the service counter, refilled my own water and had the DISHWASHER get me coffee. While I was there, my server even bumped into me. No apology. Just another look of disgust. Sorry, when I am spending +$13 for a three-egg ham and cheese omelet, and sitting in a ""French"" restaurant, I'd like to think that the dishwasher would not be the one having to help me with basic guest needs. Water and coffee? Perhaps something other than a sneer? Maybe double check to see if the order that was thrown down on the table was even correct...? Â My recommendation is that you stay home, whip some air and cream into your own eggs and save yourself some time and money. If you do decide to brave it anyway, request ANYBODY (even the dishwasher) other that TANDRA. To Tandra: I really hope that you are going to school for some non-social non- guest oriented career. Maybe you should consider switching over to McDonalds. Seems right about your people-skill level, which is to say, none."
369,"People love this place...truth is IT IS JUST NOT THAT GOOD. I waited 45 minutes to order creamy raspberry oatmeal (sounds good right?), what I got was oats with jam mixed in...I used to make that when I was five. I also got an average store bought croissant....lame. My boyfriend got store bought cereal with uncooked oats....hardly ""Cereals du Matin""...skip it. The truth is there is NO chef here, just someone who assembles average ingredients and gives them French names."
370,"Dinner Review Only. Â To clarify, the service was a 1, the food was a 2.5.The food was just OK. Â Our table had seabass (good but not great), salad nicoise (very pedestrian with dry dry dry tuna - seemed canned), and a burger (tasty but overcooked), ratatouille (below average-watery), and ""rosemary fries"" which were actually chunky homefries, and not that good. Â  The service was very bad. Â  We were seated at 6pm. Â After being ignored for 30 minutes we managed to flag someone down to take our order. Â The busser refilled our carafe of water shortly thereafter, overfilling it by about 2 inches, all of which drained into one of our diners laps, then blithely sailed away. Â We had to flag down someone to get up some napkins which were dumped in a pile in the middle of the table. Â No apologies, no concern. Â At 7, after four tables that were seated after us were well into their meals we had to inquire about our food. Â About 5 minutes later our meals showed up but we didn't see a server again until we flagged someone down for the check. Â I guess we should consider ourselves lucky though, because the table behind us, who were seated just before us, still hadn't gotten their food when we left. Â They had been informed there had been a ""glitch"" in the kitchen.This was my first time at la note and i won't come back. Â I make allowances for an off night, every restaurant has them, but when things go awry, i expect the servers to show some modicum of concern, no matter how feigned. Â I don't want to get drenched, showered with a clump of napkins, served dry-ass flaked tuna, then ignored for the rest of the evening. Â Heck, i could have all that at home, for free."
371,"Let me put it this way.....Next time I'm in Berkeley, I can't say that I'd drive out of my way to eat at La Note. The pancakes are overpriced, and the parking sucks. However, the apple sausage is good, and so is the toast. Overall, not so bad. But, I think I'll visit Venus next time. Â blah."
372,"Service is bad, and food is not too bad. Â But I don't want to be so frustrated by bad service. Â I would rather eat at Â home, or go for a picnic, than deal with the crowds and chaos. Â The service is bad even when it's not crowded, and they tend to over cook the french toast."
373,"I thought this place would be great, we went for dinner last night and were surprised by the slow unattentive service and lackluster food. Left feeling like it was a waste of time and money. Such a bummer, I had high hopes for this one."
374,Hipsters at every turn working in this place... Worth ethic is pathetic and attitude is abysmal. The food is good but not worth dealing with these degenerates
375,"This is a great restaurant if:You want to wait at least 30 minutes to get a table so small that it will barely fit your plates.You want to pay $9 for a short stack of OK pancakes.You want to yell to be heard by your companion.You want to be ignored by your waitperson.This was our second try here, and we still can't understand people lining up for an uncomfortable table, food that is only OK, poor service and ridiculous prices."
376,This place has great eggs and the grilled tomatoes are delicious! However I need to downgrade this because of the fact that we had waited for 1 hr and the hostess gave the table to someone else because supposedly they had an internet reservation which somehow got loss. Umm some people need to learn to look at their confirmations. Who knows if it got loss or they never made one. Â Anyway enough with the sarcasm but I was very unhappy!
377,"So I've been here a couple of times and the food and service was pretty ok, but today was another story.We walked in got seated right away- the waitress took our order....everything seemed fine. Our food took an hour! There was literally about 6 other tables of people in the restuarant and it took an hour. Then when our food came it was cold and the waitress had messed up our order. Â It was really disappointing. A breakfast with scrambled eggs and toast shouldn't take that long and when it comes out it should be what you ordered. I would've sent it back but I couldn't wait another hour for them to re-scramble eggs.I really don't think I'll ever go back. Seven thumbs down."
378,"The food was mediocre, but the only taste that is ALWAYS left in my mouth when I come here is the TERRIBLE service. Â Does the La Note staff go to Paris to learn how to be arrogant and dismissive? Â Not were we ignored for 5 minutes when we came in and there were tables available, everything we asked for that was extra (brown sugar, sending back cold food), we were basically given a defensive answer, such as ""oh, single pancakes are just cold"". Â No one smiled, no one was friendly. Â If they are going for the snooty Paris ""you are lucky to be here"" vibe, they got it down pat. Â  Gross."
379,"I don't know why everyone makes a fuss about this place. I've tried it twice for breakfast and both times have been unpleasant. The service is terrible. They are slow and unresponsive, even when no one else is in the restaurant. The food is OK. There are other places to get better coffee, croissants and eggs, for less money and without the Provencal kitsch."
380,"My hubby and I decided to try this place after being recommended by my co-worker. We decided to ditch the kids at grandma's and go on a dinner date. Parking was kinda hard to find on a friday night, but still managed to get a decent spot. Was a little iffy about it when we got to the door... this was suppose to be a award winning restaurant... but at 7pm on a friday night, there were only 2 tables. Ok, what the heck, we drove so far, mind as well give it a try. Inside was very cozy and cute, although the tables were hella small and the chairs were uncomfortable. The hostess sat us down at a tiny table for two in the middle of the restaurant. I noticed there was a cute little table right by the window, so i asked the hostess if we may switch over there instead. Her answer was, "" oh sorry, but that is a table for 3, and you guys only have 2 people"". I honestly thought she was racist from how she treated us versus how she treated other guests. So i asked her if it was a table for three, how come the exact same table next to it only sat 2 people. She explained that they were waiting on another person, so i said alright then. But still, it was a special night for me and my husband, considering after having two kids, we never got any alone time to dine out. So i asked again if we can switch to that table since the restaurant was pretty empty. After a few minutes of pondering, she returned and said she will go ahead and switch us, since it didnt look like it was gonna be a busy night. Half pissed of her attitutude i sucked it up and said thank you and got up to change seats. 10 minutes later, a couple walked in the door and that bitch ass hostess offers them a window seat that was supposedly reserved for 3 people!!! What the hell???!!!We ordered this appetizer... forgot the fancy name.. but basically some sliced ham with sun dried tomatoes on a warm piece of french bread. Wow, it was pretty yummy. I don't eat tomatoes, but for some reason it was a really good combo. Ater the appetizer, i thought... ok, this was good, looking forward to my entree. I ordered a salmon and my hubby ordered penne pasta. My salmon was really dry and flavorless... only ate 3 bites!! My husband managed to scarf down his whole dinner, telling me it was really ""normal"", nothing special. Now this was suppose to be an award winning restaurant... but what the heck? After the main course we ordered a creme brulee to share. That piece of s*** was burnt as hell!!! When i mean burnt, i mean BLACK! The inside... really watery and some parts were warm and some Â cold. This has got to be the most nasty creme brulee i have ever eaten. Overall this place was just not up to par... very disappointed. I was really expecting good food, but it was just barely ok. I guess the worse part was the hostess... emotionless, attitude, and so not helpful. On the other hand, our waitress was really nice... way different from that HOstess! After reading other people's review, i think i would go back, but for breakfast!!! Hopefully my next experience will be a lot more pleasant."
381,"We went to La Note this morning, at 8:30. One waitress/hostess on duty to handle the entire floor. We were seated relatively promptly, but by 9:15 had to leave, as the waitress never took our order, brought coffee, etc. Tables were waited out of order. Our neighbors ordered pancakes; when they arrived, the waitress had forgotten the jam, which she brought ten minutes later, after the pancakes had cooled, and she slammed the jam onto the table, irritated with the customer. We've eaten here before, but the service is never great, but sometimes is acceptably mediocre. When we left, we told the waitress why we were going, and she was angry, saying that she had to run the place alone and that it was not her fault, that everyone was late that morning. We drove over to Jimmy Bean's and were served within five minutes. Â I don't think we'll return to La Note...too bad, because their food is good."
382,Leaves plenty to be desired but has outdoors seating.
383,"The food at La Note is very very good. Probably one of the best breakfast places in the East Bay. La Note generally has a pleasant, competent and helpful service staff except for one particular exception.The hostess was the most unpleasant woman I have ever encountered! Â She was incompetent, inefficient and out-right rude to me and my party. I am used to a little bit of attitude and snobbery (jeez I lived in LA for 7 years)... and at this point it doesn't really bother me as long as I am generally treated with minimal respect. There was a long list for seating... we had to wait 1 hr and 45 minutes. During this time there were several tables that were open and set, but nobody seated. The hostess seemed confused by this and did not know where to start seating people. Finally the hostess called our party and we followed her inside....then she forgot about us and seated several other parties that were after us on the sign-in list. When I inquired about it she acted as if she didn't even remember calling us or ever talking to us! Finally after a long wait we were seated.The food and waiter service was great. As soon as we got the check and then signed the bill... the hostess came over and asked us to leave! My party wasn't just hanging around chatting... We were still drinking coffee, still drinking OJ... literally just signed the check! She acknowledged that we had to wait an 1hr and 45 min to be seated, but then still asked us to leave. Worst hostess ever! We paid our bill, we were friendly we left a big tip (for the waitress and bus boys etc.. i hope the hostess gets none of it) and the hostess tried to rush us out of there ...after an 1hr and 45 min wait. WTF? Not only am I never going back, but it is my mission to spread the word about this evil hostess. Anybody else experience similar problems?Think twice before you go to La Note. Â Owners/managers of La Note take more care in who you hire. I was always a happy customer until yesterday... Get rid of her!-Brian"
384,"My girlfriend and I just ate breakfast here this morning. We had heard good things and so forth, but don't buy into the hype. The food was pretty plain and horribly over-priced (my four dollar side of merguez sausage tasted like a slim jim). The service was miserable, it took the server 25 minutes to get our coffee after we ordered it. Weak. 4 dollar tip and a 50 dollar tip and I'm still irritated."
385,"I was meeting a friend here for breakfast and walked in about 8:05 am (they supposedly open at 8:00), and the rude waitress snapped ""we're not open"". I asked her when they were opening and she tells me to wait outside because she is still setting up. It was cold and I didn't want to wait outside so I asked if I could just sit down and the response was ""No, go wait outside!!"". I've enjoyed the food here but the service usually is quite rude but this was too much. When my friend arrived we walked down the street to Jupiter where we were greeted as though we were welcome customers. If they can't get the place ready on-time don't punish the customers. When I returned to my car I went into La Note and told the manager on duty of the rude interaction and she simply passed it off as a liability issue where they can't let customers in until they are set up. Here's a tip--make your cranky waitresses show up in time to set up and open at 8:00. Would I return--no way and I suggest anyone who needs an on time opening or doesn't appreciate rude service should also dine somewhere else."
386,"We were seated rapidly, but waited about 45 minutes for our breakfast to show up. When it did, we were treated to bland, undercooked potatoes, eggs, and toast. The tomatoes were pleasant, but nothing special. Wouldn't bother with it again, particularly given the relatively high prices."
387,"We have been frequent diners at La Note for years now, even celebrating birthdays and other special occasions there. However, after our last visit in late January, we won't be going back anytime soon. When we arrived and were seated and given our menus, we informed the waitress that one person in our party was allergic to olive oil, and could she recommend entrees that would be safe for her to order. Amazingly, the waitress could only recommend a salad, without dressing. When we pressed her to ask the chef if there were any items he might be able to prepare without olive oil, she came back with a no, without apology. Apparently all the meats are prepped with olive oil in advance, or so she/the chef said. I felt like we were being waited on by an automaton. I even suggested a few possibilities, all of which were shot down. What, no other oils, no butter to work with? no ability to whip up a creme-based salad dressing, or an omelet in a teflon pan?! come on!! The chef on duty for dinner is obviously only a prep cook with no ability to think outside the box. We've been to ITALIAN restaurants that have been better able to provide choices without olive oil!! Although our guest was a good sport about it, we had no time to go elsewhere before our performance, and so we stayed. I've never been so disappointed and disgusted by both the cook and the wait staff at a restaurant. Really disappointing. makes me wonder if the management has changed. I even tried to contact the owner, Dorothee, and left a message, she never phoned back."
388,"another boring, overrated, disappointing brunch option. sorry. after repeated tries, still no go."
389,"Whaaaat? Â THIS is the best brunch in Berkeley?! Â Have I really traveled across the country for limp, lifeless French toast (call it pain perdu made with cinnamon brioche sprinkled with lavender honey - that makes it all the worse) and Folger's coffee, served to me after a 40 minute wait across from my Toyota dealership (even if I like the guys there)?? Â Without even any soy milk? Â Sorry guys, completely disappointed. Â And don't even get me started on the Tabasco on the table...a place like this has got to violate some law of Berkeley cuisine...no??"
390,"i don't understand the hype.if you want to overpay for mediocre food, slow slow slow service, and unbridled snobbery, by all means, go to La Note.i'll take my petit dejeuner elsewhere."
391,"went for weekend brunch and knew it would be busy. Â it was packed. Â waited for a while and finally got seats inside. Â let me tell you something about inside: Â you're about a foot from the folk's next to you (as in, ""excuse me, sir, but there's some egg stuck in your teeth) and it is LOUD. Â however, you get to look at stacks of gigantic pastries (the cinnamon rolls caught my eye, glistening with sugar crystals) which always helps get the appetite going for a scrumptious morning meal. Â the mimosas were perfect; basically a glass of bubbly with half an orange squeezed over the top - sheer bliss. Â but the food? Â maybe i ordered the wrong thing (got an omlet with tomatoes and potatoes and other stuff i think - it wasn't that memorable) and i felt like for all the hype, it wasn't that phenomenal. Â i felt like it could have used more seasoning, salt, something. Â my friend got french toast (she gets it everywhere, like always getting the same kind of ice cream) and it was good, but i just felt like i could have probably recreated as good of a meal at home with minimal effort. Â the ingredients were fresh, and lots of places go on the whole keep-it-simple-and-delicious theory, but maybe it was a little too simple. Â the upside? Â our waiter was gorgeous. Â drop dead. Â we (shamefully) both left him our numbers. Â the downside? Â we (shamefully) both left him our numbers, he never called either of us, and now we can never go back and give the place another chance. Â c'est la vie."
392,"Looks really nice and intriguing from outside, so we decided to give it a try! Still looking for a good french onion soup after not being able to have it at Liaison, we learn at La Note that it is a north italian thing and they are a south italian restaurant, so no french onion soup. Ok, then we ordered kir royals (they were good, but can you go wrong with champagne?), a plate of assorted toasts with tapenades (it was really good), I ordered chicken with mushrooms which was ok, and my boyfriend ordered bean sausage stew with ribs. After his meal arrived he digged in everywhere in his plate to find the ribs but there were no ribs, only sausage and beans. Then, we asked one of the servers who was passing by our table if this meal was supposed to come by ribs or not, she said ""Oh, we ran out of the ribs, didn't your server tell you that?"", well no she didn't. This sort of kills the night, think about it when you are craving for ribs you just end up with beans and sausage. And what did they order to compansate their fault, a dessert! Come on, we tried to imply that we mainly wanted ribs and if we knew that they didn't we wouldn't simply order that dish! So, they said they will take off the price ""a little bit""...Anyways, they gave a 50% discount on his meal and that was it. I found it very unprofessional, I don't think I would go to this place again. Also, our server got lost after a while, never checked on us, maybe she realized what she did. We paid more than $70 for 2 people with the great discount they provided, and I don't think it was worthed."
393,"The breakfast is pretty good, but breakfast isn't that difficult to pull off. The outside is really lovely. However, the dinner at La Note is awful!! I should have guessed that it was going to be bad because the place was practically empty on a Saturday night. I had a really lackluster, flavorless fish dish (the sauce tasted like dishwater) and my boyfriend had a chicken sandwich. The chicken was so old that it was slimy and really disgusting. We both got really bad food poisoning that lasted for two days. Be forewarned: Do not have dinner at La Note!"
394,"Maybe I'm the lone voice on the planet about this place but I just have to say it: Â the HORRIBLE service makes this place not worth coming to. Â The food is good, not great; decor is nice but the place is crowded and noisy. Â The service is awful--our group waited 10 minutes before anyone came over and the waitress stopped only when we flagged her down and made her stop. Â Took another 15 minutes to get our drinks and order. Â The waitress lectured us about how we were ordering and basically told us to stop being so particular! Â All of this while 2 or 3 wait staff stood around talking to each other and slowly clearing tables, clearly more interested in their conversations than serving. Â  Almost every order came out wrong and we had to ask for syrup, more coffee, etc. Â Getting refills for tea water and coffee took flagging down the waitress and being told she was too busy to do so. Â Yikes! Â  With Venus 1/2 block away and other good breakfast places within a 5 minute walk, LaNote is simply not worth the lousy service."
395,"I went there today, Mother's Day 2008. The wait to get in was surprisingly short and well-managed. The wait for the food, however, was not. Me and my friends consumed about 3 quarts of the not-very good coffee by the time our food showed up - it must have been an hour and a half wait, so by the time we were actually eating, it was well past even lunchtime. The staff did not really bother to keep us appraised of the status of our long-awaited meal until about 5 minutes before it showed up, at which point we had already considered walking out many times. The food is fairly good, but a place with service like this would never make it in any other urban area, that is unless all the townfolk happened to have short-term memory problems. The staff were friendly but seemingly out of touch with the situation at hand, and I overheard one waitress admit to being drunk on the job, which couldn't have helped matters. Once I questioned a waiter about our meal, he admitted there was a ""50 minute to an hour wait"" from the kitchen, which is simply unacceptable; I don't care how full a fucking restaurant is. And if that really is the case, the staff should have made it known to the patrons before reserving their coveted tables. There is a general misconception in Berkeley that long waits equal good food, hence Gregoire, Cheese Board, etc. But a good rule Â to follow no matter where your restaurant is located, what day it, etc., is to not seat more people than you can conceivably serve. The fact that La Note is the fanciest and most idyllic spot to eat breakfast in proximity to UC Berkeley campus is probably what has kept them in business for so long, but from today on, they've lost my business until they can either expand their kitchen or start making more realistic arrangements in regards to service."
396,"we used to love this place, franco-boyfriend-of-mine-and-i. then we realized every time we order eggs they make it to our table cold. the toast too (although this can happen). au laits are good. jam is nice. not always worth my wait."
397,"a terrible experience - one of the worst dining experiences i've ever had. i went there for lunch midweek and ordered the special, ""steak hache"" (basically a hamburger). after a long wait and some very desultory service from our spaced-out waitress, i finally got my order. it was totally rare inside. i Â asked for them to make it med-well and sent it back. but this being a weekday, i didn't have a lot of time to spare for lunch, so after 20 mins, when it had not yet come back, i got the waitress' attention and asked where my lunch was. (at this point my lunch companions were nearly done w/their own meals.) she finally brought it, but again it was totally rare! at that point i was so furious i took the burger right back up to the kitchen since i couldn't find my useless waitress, and asked to see the manager. she eventually came out and apologized, saying ""sorry about that, these burgers are so thick that they're hard to cook."" um, what?? if you can't make the burger on your specials list, then don't put it on there, or get a better cook, or make a thinner burger! she took the dish off our bill but i left there hungry and steaming mad. (not to mention that i am a nursing mom who was there w/my baby, so if i don't get to eat she doesn't really get to eat either...). what a total waste of my time - i will never go back."
