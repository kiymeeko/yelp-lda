0,"1.5 at best. All I had were salads so I can only comment on those. We were seated outside, service became spotty, and close to non-existent once we got our food. The salad I got was the falafel salad, compatriot got what I think is a santa fe salad with a veggie patty substitute. If these are representative of the salads here in general, I'd suggest staying away from them. Overpriced, and there's waaaaaaaaay better options in the Berkeley area.The falafel salad was basically like a quarter of lettuce (if that), one artichoke heart broken apart, 4 falafel pucks cut in half, and one roma tomato. With a dressing that has no flavor, the only things that actually added to it were the feta and the falafel both of which were premade at some point. This is also a tiny salad by design since everything green is packed into this little pile in the middle for some reason with the other ingredients that weren't chopped into sizeable bites used to make up for the extra space not used. By salad. In a salad.The santa fe was also just as poorly prepared. I thought that the substitution was a funny idea to begin with but to chop a pan fried, or deep fried patty and not even chop it in sizeable pieces is atrocious. And the dressing? Also not noticeable whatsoever. I'm not sure how that is characterized as a santa fe salad if the dressing doesn't carry it over.The only saving grace was that the salads weren't entirely inedible. But that isn't really a consolation though. The things in the meal that added flavor were premade and had nothing to do with what the restaurant had created, or added. Never again."
1,The service was crazy MEAN!! What's happening in Berkeley this used to be a service oriented town but lately the service has gotten Down right nasty. Same ole same ole when it came to the burgers. No good vegan option. :(
2,"Great ambiance. Cool location. Great menu. Good food. Very indifferent service. Our server walked away after getting half our drink orders - the remainder were shouted across the restaurant. Dishes didn't seem made to order - some requests were ignored. Plating is sloppy - blue cheese crumbs everywhere including dishes that don't feature the ingredient. Worse, our one GF party member (legit celiac, for the record) found some bits of bun behind his lettuce wrap. Salad arrived with no dressing. Zero check-ins. Zero water refills (2 carafes for 7 people).For context, we brought a group of 7 at 11:30 and seemed to be among the first parties seated for the day - though well after the restaurant opened - so things were hardly rushed.Sides are excellent across the board. Highly recommend the onion rings and veggie basket. Milkshakes drew raves from our crowd.And a final word to the wise - they cook their burgers VERY lightly. Medium, incredibly, comes pink throughout with cool center. I'd recommend ordering at least one temp up from desired."
3,"I came with my roommate to Barney's once for a weekday dinner, as we were both craving burgers and Barney's was the closest burger restaurant to our place.I ordered the Barney's Classic Burger, and was pretty disappointed. The burger patty was very flavorless, and the buns were very dry. However, I would recommend trying their milkshakes. They are rather large; I only finished half at the restaurant and had to take the other half back home."
4,"I love that there was a fire roaring in the fire place. My husband and I are out seeking new places to eat throughout the bay. We landed here. I seen they had minestrone soup on yelp, so I ordered that, we both each ordered hamburgers and the truffle fries. He brings my soup, says it chicken rice ok, I said I guess. Disappointed to say the least. I asked for medium well, for medium rare and I asked waiter to fix. He brought back a new one, still medium rare. Hard roll wasn't hot, but he did take off the bill as I only ate one bite. I've had better burgers at Habit Burger!"
5,"We came here because the line at the nearby Cheeseboard was too long, and it was a bit too chilly to sit outside at the nearby Epicurus Garden.  We also had a one year old with us, so we needed something quick!Our experience was mixed.  When we walked in, we waited a few minutes to be acknowledged by a host, which seemed odd when there were several members of the wait staff walking around.  I'm used to good customer service where even if it's busy, you are at least acknowledged with ""we'll be right with you"" upon entering.  Not sure if our stroller and baby made the staff less interested in helping us.When we were acknowledged, the waiter seemed a little annoyed that he would have to help us troubleshoot where to sit and store our stroller.  I tried to reassure him that the umbrella stroller folded up as he pointed to a corner of the restaurant where I could store the stroller.  Mental note: not the most family friendly place to be, though I would expect a burger place to be.I ended up ordering the Barney's burger (medium well), and my husband and I shared the onion rings and vegetable basket.  The fried portabella mushrooms in the fried veggie basket were quite yummy, but I was disappointed with the burger.  They completely forgot the cheese and it was medium (totally raw in the center).  They took the burger back, but it came back overcooked and dry. Not worth the $12 paid. Like others have commented, I also would have expected a basic side to come with the burgers. Maybe not fries, but a small cole slaw .. something!Not sure I'll be back. Next time I'll wait it out at the Cheeseboard."
6,"I am angry. But mostly just disappointed. I've heard many good words about Barney's, but the services today proved those wrong.First of all, I just wanted to say that I've heard some people say that they've had the best burger ever at Barney's, but that is hardly the case in my opinion.Even though the burger is supposed to be gourmet, I found that the burger was lackluster. Maybe because in comparison to Scolari's, Barney's was just meh. I got the alpine beef burger, and I ordered my patty to be cooked medium well (I prefer my burgers more cooked cuz that's just more sanitary...), but it was more of a medium. But what really turned me off was that my bottom bun was all soggy and mushy. This was probably due to all the juice from the mushrooms and onions, but still. I don't like soggy buns. (Pretty sure my anaconda don't want none of those now)Since I came with my vegan friend, I was really glad that Barney's had the garden burger, which is vegan...I hope. (The waitress didn't seem too sure of it)We also ordered the garlic fries, but when they brought it out to us, they only gave us the regular without garlic. I was pretty sure that I said garlic, and I'm sad the waitress couldn't get something simple right.Anyway, service was really slow, and the staff could certainly be trained more. Half way through my meal, a waiter comes with two plates of food to my table and asks if these were ours...like BRUH, ARENT YOU THE ONE SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING TRACK OF THAT?!? And also, common sense would tell you that no, those are probably not ours since we're already eating and have more than enough food.One other thing I found unappealing was that as the waiter was seating a group to the empty table next to me, the table was still dirty from the last group's meal. The new group had to tell the waiter to wipe it, and I feel like this was just something that was done automatically.Given how Barney's is supposed to be a pretty nice burger joint, the price was not worth the quality and service, thus the rating of 2 stars. In my opinion, service is just as important as the quality of the food, when trying and rating any restaurant. Anywho, the food was not atrocious, but let's just leave it at that."
7,"Pros.  Food excellent, although a bit steep in price for burgers.  Cons.  ""Jesus people are waiting."" Service.  We had to ask more than once (to a different server as the first one we asked never brought us more) for more water even though our water jug was empty and at least my glass was empty. We ate our food and my friends couldn't finish their food and asked for boxes.  I was still eating.  We all got our checks even though  I was still eating and hadn't asked for it.  The apparent owner was hovering around until I paid after my friends paid.  (I was still eating.)  So as soon as I finished eating I produced my card, which was grabbed by the owner and run,After signing it and still leaving a decent tip and talking with my friends for a few minutes, my friend and I overheard the apparent owner say, ""Jesus people are waiting.""  Yes it is true than many Christians await Christ's second coming, but I think the apparent owner was rudely trying to get us to leave as it had been less than 5 minutes since I had finished eating and was still washing my food down with water that I had to explicitly ask for again.  Moreover it is my opinion that the owner actually wanted us to hear his rude, offensive comments  in a passive aggressive manor.  Yes people were waiting, but so what?  The table next to me was occupied by one person while her family was off possibly in the bathroom for an extended period of time.  She was not pressured to leave by the owner.  Perhaps it has to do with looking young, but our money is just as good as older peoples' money, and we might have even spent more than them as we were 3 adults, with no children.   Also there were plenty of open tables outside available and it was still warm outside.Moreover there was another time I went here with a few other young adults to order food and watch a Warriors game.  There was no inside seating available.  People were just sitting there, drinking wine, not ordering full meals.  Also there were two people occupying a 4 person table inside.  I didn't see anyone pressuring them to leave because we were waiting.  In that case we left, because it became apparent that we would not be seated inside for a long time, which is fine, so why were we passive-aggressively pressured to leave right after I had finished eating.  I would not go here until the owner takes some personal-interaction training.  I'll go to In-N_out where the burgers are just as good and no one has ever made any comments about people waiting to try to get me to leave less than 5 minutes after putting the last bit of food in my mouth."
8,"For a $12 burger, I was expecting something with a little more oomph. I got the Chipotle burger and my boyfriend got the Voodoo Burger. I wished we had gone to In-N-Out Burger instead, which is quite disappointing since these burgers were about 4 times the price of an In-N-Out double-double. The burgers are big, which might account for some of the price, but I would prefer quality over quantity in this case. The service was nice but so slooooow. It took about 20 minutes for someone to take our order, then another 30 minutes before our food came out. However, I have noticed that Barney's is pretty popular and appears pretty busy. We may have been there on an off night. I still want to give them another shot and will update my review if so!"
9,"[FOOD] I really liked their truffle fries. Their burger was also really good. Meat was cooked just as ordered. Service was decent too.[SERVICE/INTEGRITY OF RESTAURANT STAFF]This is where things are bad. This review is long overdue, but my dance team came here for a banquet and they charged more than 10% sales tax?? That's shady and also illegal? Granted they fixed it immediately after a phone call, but what kind of business practices are being implemented here if that's the norm? Another dance team had their banquet here too and they were also charged more than 10% tax....so this makes me think this place is really sketchy, and that the tax charged WASN'T A MISTAKE.These practices mean I'll never come back here again."
10,Blah. I ordered the animal style burger and mixed vegetable basket. The burger was so incredibly bland. The fried vegetable basket was bizarre. There were so many chunks of just deep fried batter. There are so many better options in the area!
11,"A nice outdoor seating area and a $5 kids menu--but only for kids 8 and under. Here's the problem: the food and service are poor. Kid's burger: the patty was small and dry and the fries were limp and under seasoned. I got a Mediterranean plate for $8.95. It was: three slices of cucumber, two tomato wedges, two lukewarm falafel, some whole wheat pita wedges,  about 1/4 cup of hummus and olives. Oh, and a tablespoon of crumbled feta. For nine bucks plus tip and tax this plate needed FLAVOR and MOISTURE.  I kept trying to get the eye of our waiter to ask him for olive oil and some tzatziki. The place was almost empty, but we were almost done before we were checked on. The men who worked there would peek around the corner from inside to out but retreat before anyone could wave at them. At least one party had to go track down their waiter to get their order placed.  I have a feeling this place would do better if people ordered at the counter and their food was run to the tables.A keypad on the bathroom...pretty tacky."
12,The burgers are dry and tough. Not sure why they have steak cut fries on the menu because they are soggy and bland and can give you a heart attack.
13,"My wife was intent on lunch at Barney's Gourmet Burgers from a week before when the aromas wafting from the restaurant caught her attention. We had to run that day but this past weekend we had an opportunity to lunch there. I like the physical facility, inside and out it feels comfortable and the decor is tasteful. The wait and buss staff were more or less on the robotic side. No repartee possible with the busboy or server, I tried to get a smile returned, impossible. I couldn't crack the code. Very strange.I ordered the California Burger, chicken breast option. I really hoped for a great sandwich but the chicken filet was overcooked. Burnt would be an apt description. My son ordered the Voodoo Burger and split it with me. He took my other half of the chicken burger.His burger was overcooked. Not burnt but close. My wife's hamburger was a disappointment as well because the beef was cooked dry. What a shame.All three burgers came with bacon. They were not shy with the quantity (note the pics). Unfortunately, and we all agreed the bacon was tasteless. Uncured, nitrite free obviously. Chewy and tasteless. I had to remove the bacon from the sandwich. The positive here is the basket of sweet potato fries we shared. The fries were among the best I have tasted. The aioli dip sauce was tasty. I would return for the sweet potato fries and kind of look forward to it.We'll order fries and maybe split a safer deli sandwich or just enjoy the fries.As we settled up I noticed the wall full of dozens of framed articles chronicling the numerous awards Barney's Gourmet Burgers has netted over years.It did not add up to the product we were served."
14,Worst place and staff unprofessional and judgemental don't deserve to work there at all these people are disrespect full and not clean
15,"Waited 15 minutes without ever receiving a menu before leaving, historically slow and inattentive service as well. Their food is good if they decide to pay attention to you!"
16,"NO to this location of Barneys! Not the fault of the servers, but the manager. Our group had made a reservation for a private room, but this man kept repeating something about ""always on Wednesday"" and led me to a room downstairs which was not separate-- noisy. We needed quiet for our confidential meeting-- that was the whole point. He would not communicate, was rude and dismissive. I frequent the Solano location and have never had a personnel problem there."
17,"Honestly, something went horribly wrong here. Ordered chilly cheese fries yet they were dried out, had no seasoning and I have no idea where the chilly was.. I got a side of ranch but even that was unable to save these fries. I tried using a fork to mix everything up and was left with a few clumps. Best runner up would be a Bacon Cheese Burger.Anyway, want top notch chilly cheese fries, hit up Burger Meister!"
18,"I have had better burgers. Don't get the salmon burger!! The salmon is really dry although you can't tell in my photos. The deep fried basket wasn't really good either. The tempura almost tasted stale - it was too hard, like they used old oil. The atmosphere was cute and the servers were really nice. The price was average around $8-$11 a burger. I also liked how they served alcohol (beer and wine). 2 stars for the food - - sorry Barney's :("
19,"I had to send the hamburger back twice, really quite thin, not at all like the pic posted. I had asked for rare, and it was pretty grey inside, so is sent it back. Rare came back only half cooked and the middle was cold (still frozen?} and couldn't eat it. The fried onions had some disgusting seasoning  Had been here six months ago and was hoping to would be better, but now never again. Service pleasant.Is there a decent hamburger in Berkeley? Fat Apples has fallen on hard times"
20,"I've been to this location a couple of times, and there are definitely some pros and cons to this Barney's.Pros: The food here is relatively good. I really enjoy the curly fries and they are really tasty. I usually order a large and it's nice to split among friends, especially if you want to try a couple different fry options. The burger I like is the Baja burger, and overall it's pretty good, but sometimes the meat can be a bit on the dry side which is rather disappointing. Cons: The service here is actually very bad. I'm not too sure why but maybe it's because there is a lack of organization among staff. It's also not that they are rude or trying to avoid you or anything because when we had the chance to ask them for anything they would help us...it just took a while. What seemed to happened during the times that I went here was that the waiter would take down your order, bring out your food, and then pretty much disappear for the remainder of the meal. It's really hard to flag someone down if you want a refill on water, and much to my surprise it was also hard to get someone to bring us the bill when we wanted to pay!Overall, this probably won't be my first choice place to eat when I have to make a decision, especially if I am short on time because service can be on the slow side."
21,"Decent burgers. Abysmal service.I came here with my fiancée on a Sunday afternoon.   There were only 3 or 4 other patrons, yet we stood waiting at the entrance for a long moment as the host (guy with ponytail) glanced at us and continued wiping down tables.  When he finally came over, no smile, no ""welcome"" or ""sorry for the wait."" Just a curt ""Two?"" We brushed it off and thought instead about the delicious burgers and sweet potato fries we were about to enjoy.Once seated, we knew exactly what we wanted, but waited another 10 minutes for a waiter to appear.  Let me remind you, the restaurant was almost empty.  We shrugged it off, ordered the Baja burger, the Western burger, and an order of sweet potato fries. Awesome!Except our waiter returned with the wrong order (curly fries).And two dirty plates with food particles still stuck to them.And in each of these instances, we had to make a serious effort to get the attention of the wait staff. We literally watched the host walk right past us to ask the other two tables how they were doing, and then continue to tidy up/stand by the door doing nothing.When we were finished eating, we waited over 10 minutes for wait staff to approach our table before giving up, turning to the guy at the cash register (named Armand), and politely asking for our check. Armand's response? He interrupted my fiancée with a very dismissive ""give me 5 seconds,"" then stared at us oddly. Why the irritation, Armand?  We're just trying to pay the bill, here.Tuka (spell check) is the sole reason I'd give Barney's any stars at all.  She is the only one who delivered prompt, kind, attentive service.  Unfortunately, I don't know if that's enough reason for us return.  The overall neglect and sour attitudes left a bad taste in both of our mouths."
22,"Burgers are good, service is not. I've been here on several occasions. The food is generally good - the burgers are juicy and flavorful, and the curly fries are a highlight, crispy with a hint of spiciness. The service starts off decently and quickly declines, however. The servers are generally well-meaning and friendly enough, but once you've placed your order it's pretty hard to flag someone down. We experienced trouble asking for more water (they really need to use larger glasses, especially given the fact that all their food is pretty salty), as well as for the bill. Although the place isn't understaffed, the staff generally suffers from a lack of organization."
23,"I've eaten at Barney's three times, and the first two times were fine. I've had burgers, fries, and milk shakes here before and while they weren't the best they were still pretty good.However, the last time I've gone to Barney's I ended up with food poisoning. I had a teriyaki burger, curly fries, and a mocha milkshake. I don't know which part of the meal caused it, but I ended up sick for almost the entire night afterwards."
24,"This is the third time I've eaten here & decided to take friends for lunch today. We ordered Chinese chicken  salad, Cobb chicken salad, curly fries, and chicken nuggets off the children's menu (yes, we had a child in tow). How could we go wrong? Simple order, right? Curly fries were great. The salads contained ingredients that were not ripe enough. Can you say rock hard, avocados? If you're going to devote a large portion of your menu to salads, at least buy fresh, ripe ingredients. The Cobb salad included the rock hard avocado, giant clumps of overdone bacon (not appetizing) and bland, tasteless,mutant tomatoes. Our dining experience makes me realize that this particular Barney's has given up. I've given up too. Never will I return. The service was fine but not enough to offset the mediocre food. Perhaps it was an off week?"
25,"I wish your kid's menu was more indicative of what we were really ordering.I ordered my daughter a grilled cheese sandwich.  I'm figuring it's American cheese on white bread.  After all, this is the kid's menu.  What arrives is sharp cheddar on  wheat/oat/nut bread.  Needless to say, my kid didn't eat it.  It was so busy in there that I didn't even bother to send it back.It's hard to have picky kids so it makes it easier on us parents if you give us a chance by being more descriptive about your food.  Your milkshakes were very good though."
26,"Food poisoned. Hate to do this, especially since I've gotten over it more or less but I feel like people should know...I came here in February with my boyfriend. We were trading off being the duke and the duchess of this place at the time because it was that good (see my previous reviews...). Came in around 9 or so and got some salads to go (Santa Fe and Asian chicken, our regulars). Tasty as usual but about an hour or so later we both got terribly violent food poisoning symptoms. I'll spare the details but it was bad. I have never gotten food poisoning in my life and man it was so terrible. My roommate thought we were dying - so did I for a little bit. It lasted all night and well into the morning. Definitely a result of their chicken on the salad. Mistakes happen sometimes but it was really upsetting. We felt betrayed by our favorite place.We didn't go to Barney's for a couple months (which, for us, was a big deal). I don't think I'll ever have their salads again but recently we were craving some garlic fries so we went ahead and tried to see if we could over it and we have a little bit.I just think people should know this happened. The best restaurants would never let practices get bad enough to cause people to get so ill."
27,"I've never bothered to leave a review before, but this made me really mad.  I went here with a gift card I had gotten for my birthday a while ago, and they refused to honor it.  The manager came out to say they had just upgraded their computer system and couldn't read the older cards.  I told her she could check the balance online (which you can, here:download.alohaenterprise…and it does show my card balance) but she said she still couldn't honor it, because she couldn't deduct anything from the bill using the new computer system.   She then added ""sorry, I know it's really complicated."""
28,"Me and my friends have been going to this Barney's location for years because we live near by.The food is good and the waiters are friendly and fast enough. However, my biggest issue with this particular restaurant is the rude guy with gray hair. At first I thought, ok, give him a break he is an older person but recently we just had enough. Instead of helping the servers the guy simply hangs out in front of the restaurant doing literally nothing while I was waiving at him trying to get his attention.I really did not want to leave a negative review but I feel like I have no choice, potential customers especially those who plan  to have a large party like we had should be aware of their so-called ""hosting."" So, the last straw was when around 15 of us (my friends and I) came to Barney's on Shattuck last Friday. When we entered I saw that their backroom was empty and I naturally thought that we would be seated there, considering it was so many of us and that is what the backroom is for, right? Not so, the above mentioned host took us downstairs where all of us simply could not fit in and it was uncomfortable and stuffy. The space became so tiny when the host added additional table to fit all of us , so the poor waitresses were basically trapped between that additional table and the stairs when they tried to serve the first dish:  fries.  Honestly it looked as if the host did it on purpose to make everyone's experience miserable.  Instead of seating in the location we wanted (it was empty and it was not busy at that time)  he tried to sit us in the most uncomfortable dark corner downstairs, ridiculous.  When we asked to change the table he looked at us as if we were crazy, very disrespectful. Anyways, after we were almost done with the fries we were finally moved to the room we wanted in the first place but why was it not possible to sit us in the backroom from the beginning?!! That is a mystery. I felt that the host simply hates his job, but I go there to eat, and it makes me not want to go there anymore because I feel that my business is not appreciated. I really like that place because the rest of the staff is so helpful and this is why it is such a dilemma to leave a review. Good food, nice waiters, and an absolutely useless host."
29,Called last night to see if they could take 8 people for dinner. I was coldly told that they closed at 930pm on Saturday night. Noticed on the website they close at 1030pm. Looks like the people working here don't really want to serve people.
30,"Alright, so let me start by saying the quality of ingredients was good and the staff was friendly. With that said, the portions were ridiculous. There is a fine line between generous and wasteful. I ordered the turkey club, which was just way too big. It was so messy to eat I would've been embarrassed if I'd been eating with business associates or with anyone I'm not REALLY close with. I honestly couldn't take a bite without taking it apart. I just don't associate the word ""gourmet"" with eating a gigantic pile of deconstructed sandwich."
31,Let me start with saying that the service was good but their hamburgers were something else. The hamburger was dry and had NO flavor at all. I had never had such a tasteless hamburger in my life until today. The only thing that saved my taste buds was their fries and ranch.
32,"Unfortunately this place has gone down in quality over the past several years. Tonight I was in the mood for a good burger and it left me wanting to drink tons of lemon water to wash away the grease and guilt. I'm not a huge fan of beef, so when I do eat it I try to get higher quality meat. Barney's used to be decent but tonight, not only did the burger make me feel sick, but the sweet potato fries were burnt. Oh well. I don't need to be eating this kind of food anyway. Save a cow, eat a salad."
33,"Barney's is a bay area  burger semichain. though touted as gourmet, their shakes and fries outshine the burgers.eats: classic burger, medium rare(6.95)-red meat, no juice, soft bun fell apart upon trying to get a better grap.-flame broiled, red onions, lettuce, tomato, island dressing-essentially had no burger flavorcrumbs:-service adequate, not busy-parking availability depends on time of day and wheater.-would skip burger next time, garlie fries next to try."
34,"Barney's, jeez what a let down. My standards for this beautiful restaurant were held high and they did not deliver! The restaurant itself is very welcoming, great service, you receive attention on arrival however, the food didn't have a great taste. Chili cheese fries were horrible not sure whether it was a soup or a bowl of chili with fries added on top. Burgers didn't have any savory taste to them. I understand health concerns but c'mon burgers need to be greasy and dirty. Sorry but I wasn't satisfy with my visit. I usually write great reviews but not today."
35,Disappointing. Frozen cheap veggie burger and the hamburger was cheap quality and tasted bad. Head somewhere else.
36,"you'll have to give me a lot mullah to ever eat there again. sorry barney's but I was giving you one more chance and you failed me .. miserably. i won't waste too much time writing this review, not worth it. I'll just say that I quit after a third of the burger and it took a bag of spicy ramen to get rid of the taste and 2 extra minutes of flossing to get rid of the small bits of hard fat bits stuck between my teeth... what is that?? What a total waste of a perfectly good weekly burger allowance! That's too bad, the place is nice and perfectly located... why would you get a burger there when triple Rock is a couple of blocs down the street. and I'll skip a few details about my 20 minute stay there which make this choice idiotic trust me...That's it Barney's you've fooled me several times over the years, shame on me,  but no mo'. take care and good luck."
37,"We had two kids with us did not get kids menu, no water, waited for a long time for someone to attend our table.We decided only tip 10% but credit card transaction showed these guys credited themselves 20%.Shame on you Barney's bueger"
38,"The food may be good if I ever gotten any service. Good food doesn't excuse poor service. The moment I walked in and stood at the ""wait to be seated sign"" I became invisible. After standing for 10 minutes, I made my way to an open table where I thought I could possible eat and get service. I was hungry but sadly my cloak of invisibility was even more powerful. After trying to flag someone down and looking eye to eye with the waitstaff,  I figured my situation was hopeless. 20 minutes and not even an acknowledgement of my existence. Oh well, maybe you will have better luck."
39,"I've eaten at different Barneys (College Ave, Solano Ave, Shattuck Ave, Piedmont Ave) throughout the years. The quality of the food is inconsistent but I've had some decent meals. I'm giving all Barney's one star SOLELY because they use GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ingredients which also includes their ketchup. I'm calling for ""Gourmet"" restaurants to switch out the GMO cooking oil (soy, corn, canola or cottonseed) to non-GMO oil (rice bran or coconut). Furthermore, switching to Organic ketchup and mustard like Annie's is a no brainer and easy to do without an increase in cost. More restaurants recognized that consumers want to eat healthier while dining out. I hope Barney's will make the switch to non-GMO food. If you believe ""gourmet"" food should be healthier then tell Barney's no GMO ketchup and cooking oil. Thank you."
40,"Ugh, I'm so sad to give this place a one. Basically I've been going to all the different Barney's in the Bay for years. This one is closest to my house so I come here all the time. I bring groups, friends, family and visitors. I also get takeout often. Over the past few months this location has been going downhill. The service isn't great and the food is just not as seasoned. It needs salt! And I'm not a big salt eater. Tonight I brought a big group in and everything was just all wrong. Our garlic fries were flavorless... how? My burger was sent back once and still wasn't right (didn't eat it). And then one particular employee there was just overly rude (name was sent privately by email). I will say, this particular person has given poor service to me in the past so it wasn't just a bad night. So, overall my recommendation is to check out the other locations until this one gets there stuff together. I've always had a great experience at the Oakland location. It's a bummer, but hopefully the management listens to constructive criticism."
41,"A couple of weeks ago, my friend and I wanted to go find a place to grab quality burgers. The choice came down to Eureka! or Barney's in North Berkeley. My friend had never had a Barney's burger before so I suggested that we go there. I've only been to this Barney's a couple of times, mostly before I reached adulthood. Normally, I go to the one in Rockridge which is pretty good, so I just made the assumption that the service and the food in NB would be of the same or relatively the same standard as the one in Rockridge. When you enter into Barney's, there is a sign that says ""Please wait to be seated"". So we followed directions and waited. The place was packed, but there were a few tables available. The host passed by and then half way turned to us and said, ""just sit wherever"". I thought, ""OK, that was weird..but whatever!"". So we went to sit a table close to the outside patio. My friend got up to go grab our menus which wasn't a big deal. I had to pee pretty badly so I got up and walked to the bathroom only to find out that I needed a key. I came back to ask for the key, stood at the register for a bit and then saw the host and asked him where was the bathroom key. He waived his hand and said in a rude tone, ""it's over there"". Where the hell is ""over there""? I looked in the direction of where he had pointed to a spot that was on a counter that was bellow the main counter and found the keys. When I return from the bathroom, my friend leaves to make a phone call and returns about 10 minutes later. We talk for about another 10 minutes and still, no waiter. We notice the waiter stop at a couple of tables, actually going to the same table twice just to ask if ""everything was OK"". I observe the host, escort a large family to the table behind us. I thought, ""he probably is doing that because it's a larger family"". But then I see that he does the same thing for two people whose seats were literally a couple of feet (no more than 5??) from the entrance. By then I'm pissed. My friend gets up to go ask if we could be waited upon and apparently when she arrives at the counter, the waitress says, ""are you ready now?"" The waitress eventually comes over, takes our order without making eye contact, acknowledging our presence or anything that is remotely appropriate and leaves. After I point out to my friend that for whatever reason, we're not getting the same service as everyone in the restaurant, she agrees and says that we should leave. Which we do.For background-- my friend and I are both African American females. She never pulls the ""race card"" but I have to admit, that I do pull it more than she does. However in this case, I was very reserved. I don't know why the waitress and the host decided to be exceptionally rude to us, but I'm assuming that this was based on our race since the only thing that separated us from everyone else in the restaurant was solely our race. We had money to pay for our food like everyone else; we were dressed normal like everyone else; we are both students like 20% of the people in that restaurant-- the only difference was that we were the only African American people in Barney's during the time. So do I recommend eating at this place? The food is great but the quality of the food does not overshadow the utter disrespect that those Barney employees showed to me and my friend. I refuse to be treated like a second class citizen so I will not be returning to this restaurant or any other Barney's restaurant.  Go to Eureka! instead."
42,"Avoid this Barney's at all costs and go to the Solano one instead.  Not all Barney's are equal apparently...We went as a big group from work.  Finding parking can be tedious, but that's not the main complaint.  There's a reason why this spot was not even half full for lunch.  I counted 5 tables max.  I had the bacon cheeseburger for $8.50.  All the bacon from our burgers were not crispy.  Nor soggy.  Worst yet...it was chewy!  Not pleasantly so.  More like beef jerky or turkey jerky.  We took a bite and chewed for a good minute or so.  Are you SERIOUS?!  I'd take soggy bacon over this any day!  First time ever I've experienced such an unpleasant bacon burger.  I had to pull out all the curled up bacon strips just to be able to continue eating the burger.  Even at that point, the burger was not improved  with the jerky/bacon removal.  The patty was dry.  I just surrendered at that point.  There's no point in continuing and consuming such calories when it's just plan gross.  I left half the burger on my plate.  Disgusted.  This meal made me SAD.I noticed my colleague's burger with a giant burnt patty on an undersized baguette.  The spicy curly fries were incredible.  YUM.  But the regular skinny fries were bland.  Does it hurt to just sprinkle some salt on these flavorless starch?  It comes with ranch sauce but it should be an option and not a requirement.  The sweet potato fries were okay.  So, the lesson to the story is to ""get the spicy curly fries.""  Their other redeeming item was the Oreo shake.  So delicious.  I'm glad I split this baby with my coworker.  It was most definitely the one satisfying thing about our meal.  I did not regret downing the shake before our burgers came."
43,"Parking is a bit hard to find here like others have mentioned.Came here on a Saturday for lunch with my boyfriend and we waited to be seated. It took about two minutes for someone to finally come and seat us. I ordered the voodoo burger and my boyfriend ordered the bacon cheese burger which came in about 10-15 minutes. The voodoo burger was actually a bit spicy but it was the perfect kind of spicy for me (considering I do like spicy foods). My boyfriend also says that the bacon cheese burger was okay. We like that the bacon is a bit thicker and they're actually very generous with the bacon instead of just one or two slices.  I was kind of disappointed that the waiters weren't even really aware of their customers. My boyfriend and I were just about done eating and all the waiters seemed to just be at the front of cashiers doing who knows what. It wasn't even that busy.In conclusion, the burgers were okay. I wouldn't really go here a lot. I honestly don't even expect that much... I rather go to In and Out and pay less!"
44,"Good but not spectacular; not up to my standards for a classy gourmet burger restaurant.My roommate said that they never have good service, and that was correct.  It took a long time for the waitress to finally notice us and take our order.  The table next to us arrived a while after us, but they got served first.  The curly fries are good and spicy.  I've had the milano with the organic vegan patty, which goes very well together.  It was quite satisfying and healthy with lots of veggies.  I've also tried the portabello burger, which is okay.The first time I came here, they forgot to cut my orange so it was just a circular slice which I couldn't eat, so I thought it was only for decoration, lol.I don't understand why the whole wheat bun isn't an option for all burgers.  For some reason, they only list it for the health-sounding burgers.Honestly it isn't worth as much as they charge.  In my opinion, burgers are pretty easy to make anyway.  For the same price, I'd rather go to Crepevine next door, which has better food and can last me 2 meals.The fillings are creative, but the buns taste like they were mass-produced.  The whole wheat didn't have grains or taste chewy; it seemed like white bread with caramel coloring and a sprinkle of sesame seeds."
45,"Was in the area on Labor Day looking for a place to get a late lunch, and decided to check this place out. Very spacious and lots of seating with a nice patio area. Service was lackluster, not that they didn't do a good job, but I didn't feel especially welcome there. Food-wise was just okay. My favorite was the sweet potato fries. Really crisp, not overly oily, very well done. The chipotle aioli it came with definitely has a kick. Ordered a guacamole burger medium rare. There was definitely a good amount of gaucamole, which I loved. The burger itself was a little over-done, and had some bits of gristle. After a while (because I'm a slow eater) the burger itself started getting a little dry. Ordered a chinese chicken salad with dressing on the side. The salad dressing was pretty tasty, and the chicken it came with was surprisingly not as dry or tough as I would have expected. The cabbage underneath had some bitterness to it though, not really sure where that was coming from. Overall, for being a gourmet burger joint, the burgers fell flat so my rating is based on that. Fries are outstanding though."
46,"A week or so after my original review I was contacted by Barney's because they wanted to apologize and send us a giftcard for the money that was essentially stolen from us. However, almost a month after, I have not received anything. I've contacted them both by Yelp and by phone and no reply, so I don't believe anything is actually being done to fix what they did. If I could give them negative stars, I would."
47,"Meh. Asked for medium rare, got well done, and only one waiter made it difficult to take back. Charging 3.25 for fries seems like a crime, especially if you won't even turn hot water on in the bathroom or keep the restaurant warm."
48,"This place is nothing special. The menu is exciting and the vibe of the place is wonderful but the food is not great. Both time I went my burgers were overcooked. This place has a lot of potential, but unfortunately they aren't living up to it yet."
49,"I have been a long time fan of the Barney's brand here and even of this location. Sadly, when I had some dear friends in town from AZ, I decided to bring them here for our ""last meal""  together as my girlfriend was wanting garlic fries one last time.First off, they now have opened up a back room which we were seated in. It was freezing cold and we felt very isolated and ignored for quite a while. We finally ordered, and things didn't work out quite right (except for the fries). Burger that was ordered well done came out medium rare (and no one checked back on us)My falafel sandwich came on dried out pita and with over cooked falafel. Everything else was mediocre at best. I must say, I was quite embarrassed that I took them here and will never make this mistake again."
50,"When I am trying a new burger joint I alway order the basic burger without all of the fancy dressings because you can clearly taste the basic components of the burger. The ones that I find most important is the bread/bun that is used and how it is prepared and the meat.Taking into consideration the word ""gourmet"" in the name of the restaurant I was expecting more but was bitterly disappointed. Bread/ Bun: Un-toasted and a regular run of the mil bun. It was not even artisan bread!!! In my opinion the toasting of the bun is an important component in the overall sturdiness of the hamburger. Why? When a bun is un-toasted it tends to soak up the condiments resulting in a soggy bun that usually falls apart as you are eating it which then turns into a much messier occasion then desired. Having a toasted bun can prevent or deter this situation from coming up.Meat: Unseasoned. Any person who is at least competent knows that there are two basic necessities when flavoring food. SALT & PEPPER. This combination helps to bring out the natural flavors of the food that it is added to. Meat, especially burgers should at least be seasoned with these two spices. If it is not getting grilled or smoked there are no outer flavors that can save a flavorless pile of meat. It had no flavor and a generous amount of condiments had to be used to make up for this shortfall.If you are in the berkeley area and you want a good burger just go to bongo burger. They have really good artisan bread, toasted buns, and meat that is flavored and cooked right."
51,"So my coworkers and I just came here for a pickup order that we placed. When I asked the guy at the counter that was bagging our food for some ranch he rudely said its already in there. There was one. One ranch sauce for a four person order. Yeah thanks guy. In that order we had three burgers, three fries and an order of deep fried vegetables. Seriously if you don't like your job don't give the customers attitude were paying for food to keep you in business. And just in case the manager has a question about who in particular this was he didn't have a name tag but a tall white male with scraggly hair tied back with a headband. Please do better."
52,"The food was decent, but has horrendous service.  I went with my friend, who ordered Barney's classic burger and an order of curly fries, while I ordered the chicken burger. The fries came after about 15 minutes of waiting, my chicken burger came in 20 minutes after that. My friend's burger still hadn't arrived, and as we waited for 10 more minutes, he called the waiter over and asked her where his order was. ""Oh, you ordered another burger? Chicken burger?"" She said as she batted her confused eyes. ""No, I ordered Barney's classic beef burger. Medium rare.""""Oh, okay. I'll get that.""No apology, nothing. His burger finally came in after a while, but yeah, the service was awful. The chicken was rather dry and tasteless, and the burger was pretty average in general. I might come back to try their specialty burgers however, because there is an extremely wide selection on the menu. The highlight of the meal was definitely the curly fries. Ambiance was nice, except some dude in the back kept singing ""Torn"" by Natalie Imbruglia. Sorry to break it to you dude, but if you want a good meal after a breakup, just head on over next door to Crepevine instead."
53,"Chili = VERY bland and was extremely disappointed. The worst part was there was hair in my food!  It took a long time for my burger to come out the first time, and when I complained it took another 20 minutes for the replacement. No comp or even an apology by management was given."
54,"These are overpriced Whoppers.My friends and I came here for lunch. They ordered the Baja and French hamburger, while I ordered the Classic. We asked a server if the orders came with fries, he said yes, but when our original server came back, she said no :/ so we ordered some spicy curly fries. The fries came first and they were very good, but when the hamburgers came, oh man, they were sorely disappointing. My friend asked us, ""Do you want my bacon..."" I had grabbed a piece before he finished his sentence, ""Because these are really gross."" And indeed, they were really hard and tasted old. He pulled out all the strips. My other friend said, ""Why does the feta cheese taste funny?"" I was just upset I had to put together my own hamburger and that it tasted so MEHH. All of this work for MEH? SERIOUS? Thus, we all agreed they were BK Whoppers priced at 7-10 bucks. Not worth it. Go to True Burger, Scolaris, or even In-and-Out if you want a great burger for the price."
55,"The food is ok, not terrible but not amazing. We got seated downstairs by ourselves and waited over 15 minutes until our server came to get our drink order. But by then, we were ready to order food as well.Our server was alright. She wasn't rude, just not very friendly. Maybe she just had a long rough morning or busier lunch, since we came in around 2.In the end, I probably wont't be back. Everything about this place was just mediocre. Nothing stood out to make me want to come back."
56,"Eh... I feel it's criminal for a high-end burger joint (with the word ""gourmet"" sandwiched in its title) to consistently serve underseasoned, overcooked burgers, when you order rare. I also had an episode at Barney's in which a waitress got almost every single item we ordered wrong. ""No, I DON'T want this burger-- cross that out please--"" ""Oh don't worry, I'll remember."" ""And we would like everything to go.""""Uh huh.""(15 minutes later.)""Here's your basket of large curly fries.""""... We ordered a small bag of curlies... to go.""""Oh, NOW you want it to go.""""...Yes, that's what we said.""(15 minutes later.)""Here's your orders to-go.""""No... this is the burger we DIDN'T want.""(Waitress scoots off to deal with other customers, and comes back to scowl at us when we return the burger at the cash register.) Though the curlies are indeed magnificent, (crispy, mealy, perfectly seasoned, piping hot) I just don't think the exorbitantly priced squiggly fries are enough to redeem this establishment. Perhaps the place is too busy. I'd rather go home and make my own burger.Bottom Line: Expensively unglamorous."
57,Meh..always loved Barneys but the staff here today was unfriendly and the food was underwhelming. Also not a fan of dining with dogs. I love dogs but I don't  think they belong in restaurants and the management was blase when I asked about another customer eating with their dog.. these people actually were feeding their dog food from the table! Eww...
58,"I have to start by saying, I LOVE this place for their food and that this review won't change the fact that I am a customer here. But, if I owned or managed this restaurant, I would love to know this experience and feedback: Last night, I went to Barney's for dinner. A very strange looking man entered the restaurant and proceeded to approach the table of a young family eating. I'm not sure what was said, but I assume he asked for food and the family gave him their food. This continued for more than 10 minutes while more than 6 staff members of the restaurant stood back and watched. I felt that the owners and managers of this restaurant should know what happened so that proper training can be given to their staff of how to approach this situation and protect their customers. I am 100% pro-giving to others, especially those in need, but while sitting at a restaurant, I don't expect to be approached for food I'm currently eating. As a customer, it disrupted the entire restaurant and it was outwardly obvious that the staff had no idea how to handle this situation. In the end, the family's meal was not comped (as I believe it should have been) and nothing was said by the staff such as an apology."
59,"Came here after a day of shopping around in Berkeley.  I must not have ordered the right things because my experience with the food was not that great.  Service was good.  Our orders were correct and came out quickly.We ordered the chili cheese fries and a single order of sweet potato fries.  The chili cheese fries were HUGE.  It could easily have been shared between 4+ people.  The fries were good and crispy but the chili itself was very bland.  The chili could have used a dash of salt and extra oomph with the spices.  The sweet potato fries were good and the right size for one person to eat with their burger.I ordered a turkey cheeseburger with bacon.  The burger patty was HUGE.  The burger was okay but didn't LOVE it.  I've had a similar burger at The Counter and enjoyed it much more.  I feel like the size of the burger was trying to make up for what it was lacking in flavor.If I was in the area again, I'd probably try somewhere else.  =("
60,"Want some good awesome burgers? Well... not this place. It's one of those places where you hear the word ""gourmet"" and you get skeptical whether  food will be good or not.Went to this place with a bunch of friends, we had a gift card, it was worth it cause our meal was practically ""free.""But if we'd have to pay for food here, which are higher than normal burger places, it wouldn't be worth it.I'm not saying this place is down right horrible, it's just not the place for my taste, burgerwise.Waiting line may be long at times, so I don't know what the hype is all about. Our entire party didn't get too excited about our food this time. :("
61,"In all fairness, not 100% sure this is the Barney's we went to, it may have been the other Berkeley location.I ordered my burger well done, and it was still mooing."
62,"This place is a joke undeserving of finishing my rev--(One star for the fries, one star for the location, and -1 star for the inability to cook or season beef above the level of a prison kitchen.  And I'm probably being unfair to prisons.)"
63,"I think the place is a little over rated. They do have lots of different style burgers to choose from but nothing over the top. I have tried a few different ones (the beef is much better than the chicken) and I wasn't too excited. A little over priced for what you get and the fries or onion rings are sold separately. My husband and I had two burgers, 1 small side of curly fries and a coke the tap was over $30.00 not including tip."
64,"I've been here twice.1. A while ago.  Would have given it 3 stars.  I had a burger of some sort, and shared fries, and remembered liking it all.2. Recently got a to-go order.  We had ordered a milkshake to go with a few burgers, and for some reason they made the shake right away, so when the burgers were ready to go the shake was just about melted.When I opened up my dinner, I noticed the entire bottom of the box was covered in greasiness.  This was by FAR the greasiest burger I've ever had, and it was chicken breast!!  The bottom part of the bun was totally soaked in fat, so I had to throw that out.  It was pretty much disgusting, but I had no choice as I was starving.Now I know it's a burger place and not going to be super healthy, but definitely a meal I wish I could take back...would have saved me a week's worth of workouts."
65,"Meh.  ""Gourmet"" it is not.  I was there at 4:30 on a Friday and the place was mostly empty.  They didn't seem too happy to see me (but hey; I'm a nice person.  I smile.  I'm polite.  I tip well.)  The burger was très bland and they forgot the tomato, which I'd specifically asked for.  Then it took forEVER to get the check, while I was sitting out on the patio freezing my tuchas off.  And then later that night I had inTENSE tummy distress.  I mean, it was bad.  I can't say for sure that that was specifically because of Barney's, but I think I gave them a fair chance.  Next!"
66,"Food wasn't anything spectacular. Burgers were tasty, but not any more exciting than a burger at almost any other restaurant. Fries are extra, and they are just as overpriced as the burgers.Service was extremely slow, even though it was not very busy. We saw our waitress when she took our order and when she dropped off the check. Someone else brought our food, which is always annoying when they don't know who ordered what.Kids seemed to have the better value menu, although they cut off the age at 8 years old."
67,"The Hubby & I had the teriyaki turkey & voo doo chicken burgers, then shared a  onion rings & mixed vegetable basket & a chocolate shake. Can't say I was overly impressed with the food or service.  The grilled chicken on the voo doo was pretty bland, no real seasoning on the meat itself or the sautéed mushrooms, which were just a little oily. Rather they provide u with this sauce in a cup, which looks like thousand island & doesn't taste much different. Also, the onions rings/veggie basket was supper greasy, could have rested on a paper napkin before bringing them out. Chocolate shake was good, burgers were properly cooked (no red spots or over cooking) & Hubby liked the teriyaki. The servers were friendly & quick getting the food out, but became confused about who our chocolate shake belonged to at some point & tried to give it to the table next to us before they declined & realized it was ours. Then at some point we fell off the radar completely & they never came back to give us our check or clear our table. Finally my husband had to go ask for it & pay inside because we really wanted to go on with our day & take our puppy to the Marina before the sun went down. In addition, the experience cost us about $45, which we felt was a tad too high for a forgettable burger meal, where we shared a side order & drink. That said, we took our puppy with us, so we could keep an eye on him & dined outside. It appears that the family dining next to us were either the owners or family of the owners & asked us if our puppy liked bacon. We responded, ""does a pig love mud?"" So he went to the kitchen & brought out a small carry out carton full of bacon & some water on the side. Suuuuuuuper sweet & the puppy (2 yr old boxer) loved it. We rarely feed him table food, so he was ecstatic. Honestly, that was the only bright spot, so we clearly won't be going back."
68,"Wow, what an experience. Some restaurants are so BORING! You order something simple, like French fries, and they just bring them out for you to eat. Yawn! Not Barney's! They might bring them out, but it's not likely! Very exciting, you never know if your experience will be bad, or... terrible. At a lot of establishments, if you order something like a pita with falafel, they would put all of the ingredients INSIDE the pita for you. Laaaaaaame. Not Barney's! They will happily pile all of the ingredients on top of the pita, and you get the exciting job of trying to stuff it inside without destroying said pita. I need more experience making my own pitas, so it's probably my fault that it was awful. Some restaurants will come by and make sure you are happy, what a bunch of pandering idiots. Barney's has it right. Screw things up and then stay away! God forbid you have to listen to a customer make a bunch of complaints about your lousy food and service. What an exciting adventure it was at Barney's... So exciting that I don't think I'll ever come back!"
69,Omg...this was the worst meal I've ever had!!!  It was so bland I may as well have been chewing on a cardboard box!!!  Save yourself the aggravation and disappointment!  Go somewhere else.
70,How disappointing. My California burger and my husband's burger with mushrooms were tasteless and the buns fell apart. Service was so-so. I ate at a Barney's years ago and hoped it would be better but nothing has changed. Never going back.
71,"This place specializes in burgers?! Really?We ordered take out last night.  This was not the first time we've eaten here so we were expecting a good meal.  Over the phone we were asked how we liked our burgers cooked and we both said medium.  When we get the food home I open up my burger and the bottom half of my patty is completely charcoalized.  It's not just well done, it has been burned into solid black carbon.  This isn't just a poorly cooked burger, it's an inedible carcinogen!  My fiance's burger was not as bad but it definitely wasn't medium. So we call back and ask them to make another one.  My wonderful significant other makes the trip back to do the exchange and the guy behind the counter doesn't offer to comp anything in our order.  He also doesn't even apologize.  (Why do we tip again?? for good service right?  ok-just checking)  The second burger is not burnt to charcoal, but it is DEFINITELY not a medium.  It's well done.  Couple questions come to mind:  1.  This is a gourmet burger joint and they can't cook a medium burger to order?  2.  Why do you bother asking how guests want their patties cooked if their two choices are a) cancer causing charcoal b)well done.  I'm kind of bummed because we definitely enjoy a good burger.  The only reason this isn't getting one star right now is because we've had decent experiences before.  Especially at the Albany location.  Really though, can you imagine if this was our first ever experience here?  At some point, a place has to stop relying on it's reputation and actually deliver some quality service and food."
72,"This Barneys makes a decent burger but the service is embarrassing. After our water came, we literally sat and waited for 10 minutes before a server came to greet us. In fact I had to waive one down even though there were more that 5 staff behind the counter ""pretending to stay busy."" This included the manager who sat us! No excuses the place wasnt even that busy. Moreover, this was the second chance I gave this place in 3 weeks in hopes that the shotty service the first time was just a fluke. Unfortunately not - the staff is burnt out so dont go here unless service is unimportant and you dont mind waiting."
73,"Location apparently does make a difference.   We had the urge for Barney's "" gourmet"" burgers. And the Shattuck location let us down big time.   I had previously eaten ate the College Ave location on a recommendation and enjoyed the entire meal.  The Shattuck location was the complete opposite.  Barney's bacon is know as thick and crunchy crispy.  But this was like chewing stale beef jerky.     I was craving my rare helping of cholesterol and actually just told her to take it away.   I was told they come in the morning and fry p a huge batch and throw it all in a big bucket.   Well I looked in the keitchen and she wasnt kying. There was a huge bin of pre cooked baconI also like my skinny fries very crispy when I go for the unhealthy meal.  And they came out cold and not so crispy.  I also thought I remembered the buns were grilled.  But the bread was cold and stale on top of a burger .  And the cheese on the burger was not even melted maybe no one wanted to work on New Years Day. But dont take it out on me and my meal.I will NOT be returning to this location on any day and i recommend no one else does either"
74,"When we left my 8 year old daughter said: ""well...at least it wasn't poisoned.""It was awful. The western burger that was ordered medium was WAY overcooked and the bacon was fried to a burnt crackling mess. My turkey burger tasted like cardboard and was served on whole wheat SLICED bread, which turned to mush in about 2 minutes. It had a tiny piece of lettuce and 1 tomato slice.  Never again Barney's."
75,"This franchise is coasting on its past reputation and accolades. The quality of the hamburger meat is inferior and the grill staff, who have one thing to do, can't manage even that. Twice I ordered a burger rare and got it back medium to medium rare. Rare seems to scare them. Whatever, this is to burgers what Spenger's is to seafood--a shadow of what it once was. I hope the original owners pocketed a packet for essentially handing it over to twenty-something know-nothings."
76,"Went there for lunch with a friend.  Both of our burgers were solidly decent - three stars worthy.  There was nothing special about them.We got the shoestring fries and guacamole for them as an appetizer.  (What? Guacamole is much better than ketchup for fries.  Try it.)  The guacamole had too much seasoning - you'd taste the avocado right when you put it in your mouth, then poor seasonings would overwhelm it.The fries were bleah.  They had no good texture, and no real flavor.  The colder they got, the worse they got.I wouldn't never go back, but I certainly wouldn't do it unless a friend dragged me there."
77,"The turkey burgers have helped Barney's earn its 2nd star. Otherwise, I would shake an angry first at Barney's and reluctantly give it 1 star.  If you go, the ONLY burgers I'd recommend are the turkey burgers [in particularly, the Sunshine turkey or the North Beach turkey burger].  The sweet potato fries, curly fries and the veggie basket are also pretty tasty (Jack In The Box curly fries are better, though).  Otherwise, the beef burgers SUCK.  Ain't no other word for it.  Other reasons I would not recommend Barney's:- Sh!tty-@$$ customer service.  Probably one of the worst waiters I've ever had in my entire life.  He scoffed at us when we asked for recommendations, was not helpful at all, made a mistake on three orders and only came back at the end of our meal to give us our check.  When I asked if we could split the check, he looked at me as if my head had spun 360-degrees and I was speaking in demonic tongues.  WTF.  Mister, did you actually want tip?!?- I said it once, but I'll say it again.  The beef burgers SUCK.  You could save some money and grill a better burger with frozen patties.  No joke.  I tried my friend's classic/regular beef burger and it had a lovely cardboard/saw dust aftertaste.  Yum.  My other friend ordered a beef burger with a baguette and the baguette was so stale/hard, he could have played ball with it."
78,it's just another ok burger in the bay area with sooo many choices to choose from. sure the menu is large and it can be difficult to decide on what you want but it can be a little bit too overwhelming. first off all when you start getting sooo many topping on your burger that's when you began to lose topping or worse have your burger fall apart. the meat doesn't taste as fresh as you would think and very bad quality. just keep it simple and you have an ok burger you can work with. in my opinion still to this day the best burger in the bay area is at val's in hayward. trust me here and check em out! you will thank me i promise you!
79,"Like everyone has said before me; the fries are awesome.  We got a basket of both the curly friends and the sweet potato fries.  Both were pipin' hot and very well seasoned.  The burgers however are another matter...I had the Milan burger and my husband had the chili burger.  Both burgers could have benefited from a little salt and pepper.  The chili burger's chili had beans in it, which is weird for a chili meant for a burger.  I suspect that the chili came out of a can which is quite disappointing if true.  The service there was horrible.  We had this old man waiting on us.  Combining his bad English, his bad hearing, and his little desire to give us any kind of service all equals out to just horrible.  My husband ordered a shake (which was pretty good) and the waiter grabbed his menu away and turned to me to order.  I ordered and then the waiter started to walk away.  He had already taken a few steps before my husband was able to grab his attention and say that he wanted to order a burger too.  Just weird. Overall prices are pretty good for a burger joint.  Perhaps a bit more expensive but I guess you have to look at the location of the restaurant.  There are so many other places to try in the area that I can hardly suspect that we'll be back to Barney's."
80,"BOY, is this place going downhill!  My God, could they charge any more for something they give out so sparingly? I'm talking here about the fries, curly fries, and ESPECIALLY the mixed vegetable basket (approx $6.50 and now 1/2 the size it used to be).I have been going to Barney's since 1988 I believe, and boy were they good in their heyday.  Today's mess is appalling with cut corners on everything.  If you're going to charge an entree price for sides, PLEASE fill up the basket?I notice this last time that they have changed mushrooms in the fried veggie basket to shit-ake rather than the yummy large white mushrooms they used to serve (oh you guys are sooo posh and hip).  Their zucchini has shrunk to something you might find in the midwest in winter, and the onion rings are probably from the 5 lb. bags for $1.00 at Food Maxx.  And all they have to do is put a batter on them and fry them and charge you a 500% markup and they can't even do THAT any more.Burgers are still okay, but prices have gone up.  At least with them you feel like you're getting something for your money with those though."
81,"I came here with about seven of my friends. We had heard of the place but none of us had actually come. We were surprised that there were no sides to our burgers as the prices made us believe otherwise. Regardless, we had no complaints and it was a pretty good dinner.We had sweet potato fries and shoestring potato fries; they were good but nothing really to write home about it. I'm thinking next time I come, I plan on grabbing the curly fries or at least the steak fries. We munched through them and talked a bit because the burgers took a while to come, especially when there were eight on the way.I had the chili cheese burger and it was quite disappointing. The chili was rather bland. it was more of a kidney beans in a very weak sauce that was quite flavorless. There was no added meat in the chili and it was not good at all, especially in comparison to the burgers that my friends had ordered. I love chili and I love burgers so when you combine the two, I am normally stoked. However, Barney's disappointed me.The wait staff were nothing to write home about. They barely checked on us. The waitress manning the register was rather rude when I had handed my Discover card to pay. According to her, the eye rolling, and the quick tongue, their manager instructs them not to use Discover; keep that in mind! For the price, I really expected more out of this place. I do not think I will be back."
82,"We liked the food, but the service really doesn't cut it. We've come multiple times and each time, it took a good while for a waiter to get our orders. It may be that the place is understaffed, but we have definitely waved our hands and were ignored by 2-3 waiters chatting behind the counter. We don't go here anymore. Instead, we head up onto Solano for our Barney's craving."
83,"This review would be 4 stars, because their fries are amazing and burgers okay, but I had a horrible customer service experience. I ordered takeout, and among the items was a thai chicken salad (which they have listed on their online menu). I got to the restaurant, tired and hungry, and the cashier informs me that they didn't make that salad anymore, so they made me a chinese chicken salad. NOT what I wanted. If they had informed me of this on the phone, I would have made another choice. He didn't offer to make another one or discount it, he just said he could take it back and refund me. Um, i'm hungry, and have to leave, so no. It wasn't good either -- just chicken and some crispy crap on a bed of lettuce with sugary sauce. I wrote feedback to the website and have yet to hear back (this was 2 weeks ago). I will have to resist their curly fries just to prove a point."
84,I'm not crazy about anything here except their curly fries. The service and food is so so and expensive.
85,"I've given Barney's way too many chances and have to conclude it's mediocre. I don't know what's worse, the flavorless patties or the soggy buns. Barney's really is diner food dressed-up to look ""gourmet"".There are so many places in Berkeley to get a better burger: T-Rex on Gilman, newly-opened Flame on College Ave, Bistro Liaison just down Shattuck"
86,"We went to this joint this evening. Though there were several open tables on the main dining room, the waiter took us downstairs, where no other customers were seated. The problem was that there was a strong smell and a cold draft, which made it quite unpleasant. We sat for ten minutes and no one came to take our orders, or anything. We were simply forgotten. This was very strange, even for a place lie Barney's, where one doesn't expect much in way of service.I always feel that, if you are given the worst table in the restaurant when there are others available, run, do not walk, out of there, which was what we did. We were glad for not having stayed. There was definitely something wrong with this place."
87,"Burgers are not supposed to be gourmet food. Repeat after me! Listen, you give people three burger choices: Hamburger, Cheeseburger, and Bacon Cheeseburger. If you want to get really fancy, you also make some good fries and shakes. I think having 20 bajillon different burgers on your menu is neat, but when they taste mediocre what's the point of it all. I don't understand how this place is supposed to be a Berkeley institution? Did this place peak at some point? The curly fries here are really the only thing worth mentioning, but they're crazy huge (feeds 2-3 hungry folks), so way too much for a single diner like me."
88,Bummer.  I could have gone to one of my favorite places in Contra Costa County for about half of the price and had a good meal.  Aloof wait staff.  Rest rooms were sopping wet everywhere.  Did they have to hose it down?  Ew!  Fries were soggy and flavorless.  Soda was flat and mixed wrong.  Burger was tough and flavorless.  Bun was stale.  My husband thought his burger was flavorless until he tried mine.  The only redeeming feature of the meal?  Something I wouldn't touch - the Turkish Coffee shake.  My husband said it was fantastic.
89,"Not a fan at all. I've tried to like this place and have kept coming back to try the different burgers. I am never into their burgers and the prices that are attached. I find their portions are too big. Especially in light of how lacking they are. They try to hard. It's a burger for goodness sake.I know that sounds weird to some people, but I always have leftovers and left over burgers kinda suck. I hate wasting food and I always do when I eat here. So once, I went with a girlfriend and since the portions are so big (and the prices high) we decided to split a burger and fry order. They gave us major beef about it and were really upset by us taking up a table with such a small order. It was terrible service and as usual, not nearly as good as the price tag warrants. So I won't be going back."
90,I have enjoyed barneyburgers for years but the last two had pieces of bone!!! Yuck. Also bad for teeth if you bite down on a piece of bone.
91,Garbage. Don't eat here. Over cooked burgers and tasteless fries. 2 stars only for the location and decor.
92,"when I first heard of barneys I thought it would be amazing, boy were my expectations crushed the food is over hyped but I gotta say the service was nice"
93,"BARF-O-POTOMUSI used to love this place until recently.... last time I went here I felt as if I were dining in a central American ghetto/ back alley.  There were condiments all over the upholstery, hair in my drink, the fries were cooked in week old grease and the rude staff totally undercooked my burger. Gross I will only go back if I am starving and every other restaurant is closed"
94,"Worst service I've gotten from a restaurant in years.The burgers are inventive, flavorful, and pretty good, but the abysmal service ruins the experience. Our server forgot key parts of our order, brought us improperly cooked burgers, and didn't come back to the table until we were ready to leave. I wish I could have reviewed the sweet potato fries I ordered, but they never showed up, and by the time our waitress came back to check on us we were fed up and ready to leave.When we finally got the check nobody came to take the payment, and the staff seemed confused when we finally decided to just take it up the the counter to pay.I'm not the kind of person who normally complains about service even when it's bad since I know how hard the job can be, but this was beyond even my low expectations.I doubt I'll be back."
95,"I am not a fan, at all.  The burger patty was dry, the milkshake was disgusting.  The waitress was nice enough to take it off my bill after she saw that I only took two sips.  That was nice.  I like their sweet potato fries.  That was the first time I've had one of those.  They were good, not good enough for me to ever come back, though."
96,Host tells me not to write my name on the list as he has it all memorized. My friend & I wait over 50 minutes only to be told that he has forgotten about us & seats us right away afterwards. We will never be attending this location ever in the future.
97,"My husband and I would go here all the time BUT the last time we went there he had pieces of GLASS in his hamburger!!!  It was so scary and the people that worked there didn't even take it seriously and didn't really care that much.  Luckily he's fine but we can never go back there.  I mean, how does glass end up in the meat????"
98,"Finally tried this place since I think it landed on Diablo Magazine's best burgers of the East Bay.  I'm not sure how that happened though, because this was truly one of the worst burgers I've ever had.  The meat was so dry that I couldn't even choke it down.  After reading the reviews here, maybe I missed something not getting curly fries, but I had the regular fries, and they were awful too.  I would rather go to In-N-Out any day of the week than come here."
99,"really good burgers fries, salads and shakes. aweful service. had to go to the counter to order beverages because our waitress was on break. Sat there for 20 mins (menus closed) before someone took our order. the other locations are better."
100,"Been to Barney's dozens of times. People I know must like it more than I. Not great buns, really not great bacon, super sloppy with the extras, and the onion rings are gloppy with excess batter, but curly fries are most delicious and so is the Turkish coffee shake. I've stopped ordering beef from them and now prefer the veggie burgers even though I love beef burgers at other places. They've just failed to keep me happy I guess."
101,"Slow service and mediocre food. This place is suppose to be gourmet burgers, hence the name of the restaurant ""Barney's Gourmet Hamburger"". I would prefer Red Robin over this spot. So I came in with my family on Saturday evening and it was a slow night as the server told us. You would think service would be on point being that it was a slow night and you didn't have too many tables. It took at least a full 5 minutes before anyone had come by to greet us or even serve us water. We quickly ordered our food and within 10 minutes order of steak fries and curly fries were dropped off at our table. What I didn't understand was dropping off the fries first without our burgers. As we sat waiting for the rest of our food we had scarf up our french fries. It took another 10 minutes until the rest of the food arrive. I had order the Wild West burger with a salmon patty and as I took my first bite into wasn't even hot. The presentation of the food was not what I expected: the lettuce was wilted, the pickle was dry and the cheese on my burger wasn't even melted. The salmon patty itself did not looked fully cooked, which I assume why my burger was not even hot. I could tell that the food was left out for awhile before it was taken to our table and it does not take 20 minutes to cook up burgers. The best part of the meal was the french fries, but I wish we were able to enjoy it with our burgers. For a slow night, the food itself was gross and the service  was not on top of it. I've been to the Solano Avenue location and I much prefer that location over this."
102,"A place to eat. not dining, just eat. You're hung over, and 'gourmet' is the last thing in the list.  Have a milkshake, wonder why the place is so damn loud, why your burger is too dry,and too expensive."
103,"Barney's always had one of the best tofu burgers around.  Good flavor, hefty, but not too heavy.  Over time, they got thinner and thinner which is not good since tofu is basically water.  Still, I had one a couple weeks ago and it was fantastic.  Today, I got one and it was a slab of tofu.  They didn't even try to disguise it by cutting it into a patty, just a fucking slab of tofu.  Terrible!  I asked the waitress about it and she said they did change up the patty.  I told her then it should say that on the menu.  i guess my complaint is that it's tricking people into thinking they're getting one thing that they're familiar with, then they get something so godawful, it's inedible.  That alone makes me not want to give them my money.  And l'm not a disgruntled vegetarian.  I eat cheeseburgers and Barneys is fabulous at that.  Tofu burgers, not so much."
104,"I have been to Barney's many times, but after this last visit I was inspired to write this harsh review.  I agree with all the others who say that the curly fries with ranch are quite good.  But, that is about it.  The service was poor, the food was the same, and the ambiance is not why you go to Barney's.  To be fair, I have been to Barney's a few times and most of them are great.  That's why this particular Barney's was extremely disappointing.  Suggestion: go to a different Barney's."
105,"I've been here, to this particular location, many times over the years but not recently. Maybe 2 years ago. A friend was in town with her fourth grader for lunch so I knew a burger would be easy. Went to Barney's thinking of the ambiance and space. Like the new outside seating and the place was busy. We were seated right away and for the most part the service was very good. Just because a fourth grader wants a burger doesn't mean I do. I had a salmon burger, bad idea. I think they gave me the last bun in the bag, you know, the smashed one, without warming it or giving it any life. The flat pressed ""burger"" patty was not what I think of when I think of salmon burger. Looking back I wanted a salmon sandwich, not a burger. Regular burger fixings on the side and that's that. The last time I was here, before this salmon ""burger"" experience I had a nothing special salad which is why I didn't go that route originally this time. Little lettuce, some olives, jarred marinated artichoke hearts I think. Not a good plain salad place if you ask me. So I stayed away from the salads as well. My friend had a turkey burger, which I expected to be a homemade like turkey patty, that was pressed like mine. Frozen is what comes to mind. Gardenburger looking patty. That's not a burger to me. Absolutely missed my wants this go around and last. Spicy curly fries were as I remembered, good... but I don't know if I'm wiling to go back when I want a real burger... what if that doesn't pan out either?..."
106,"Despite the poor service, I still come here about once a month. The burgers are better than before, and the fries and vegetable basket are still awesome. But the service is even worse than before. I had to ask for the check and to-go boxes at least 3 times. They just seemed to keep forgetting. They have forgotten whole orders from my friends in the past. Service is definitely lacking. The main reason is that the servers are spread too thin. They seem to be running around all the time and they don't really have time to think. This place has the potential of getting 4 stars from me, they just have to step up the service."
107,"okay, I must admit that I LOVED this place in the 90's. -particularly the one on solano. But it seems to have maybe been franchised, as this location on shattuck is horrible. The food is mediocre and the service is even worse. They got my order completely wrong on my first visit, and the food was cold by the time I got it. I decided to give them a second try, and low and behold - same thing - order wrong, food cold."
108,"The food is good -- it's definitely a ""gourmet hamburger"".  This Barney's is a short walk from our house and as such, we used to go here several times a week.  But then the prices went up a tad (which is to be expected these days)....... and the service TANKED.  I can't stand to go to the place anymore because every single time (literally!), something will be wrong.  Three buns on a burger.  Bacon instead of avocado.  Veggie burger instead of beef.  ""For here"" sauce containers placed in a to-go box (thanks for the free dish!).  Buns when lettuce wrap is requested.  GIANT weirdo salad in place of a side salad.  The list goes on.  It's ridiculous.  Too bad the food is good and it's our favorite place to get a burger fix, but *wow* we really hate to go here any more.  Especially since we're paying upwards of $20 for two burgers with no sides and they can't ever get the order right anymore!!!  We've had several conversations with the management and they don't care.  They'll fix the order, but won't fix the problem.  I'm never going back again, but when my boyfriend gets desperate, he'll sneak over there... and then call me to report the next thing they got wrong with our order!!I guess overall it's better for us in this economy to save the cash and frustration and make our own burgers at home :)  Too bad for them!  They lost some seriously loyal customers!"
109,"I can understand why people get excited by the list of choices they get here. ""What? It's not just with or without mayo? I can get teriyaki? Blue cheese? That sounds fancy!"" But getting creative with the ingredients does not make for ""gourmet"". A gourmet is some who understands and loves food. I don't get that impression here. It's just a diner with some additional ingredients in the kitchen. Even the burger meat looks like it's ground and shaped in a factory. Then they add that small bit of fruit to your plate to impress and delight the newbie foodie. And don't get me started on the salads. Most of them are mixes of ingredients that just don't work together. I'm not saying the food is bad, but I'd rather pay a few dollars more and go down to Cafe Rouge, on 4th St. Or pay a few dollars less and pick up a burger at Oscar's, only a few blocks away on Shattuck."
110,A wide variety of burger toppings does not make for a good burger.
111,"Gourmet hamburgers?  That must translate to dry, dry, dry meat.  Spit out meat, too difficult to swallow.  Get... me... more... water.Unfortunately, the burgers are disappointing.  It's a shame since their fries (both steak and curly) are great with Ranch sauce, their milkshakes are delicious.  If I go, it's to order fries, a hot dog and a milkshake..."
112,$14.14 for a mediocre burger and a pre-made shake. To go. Barney's quality just does not justify what they charge.
113,"after being lured by the smells for that past half year, i finally had a chance to try it today. unfortunately, it just doesn't taste as good as it smells - oily and super dry - i just couldn't find redeeming qualities."
114,"My first Barney's was the one in LA, and I've been there way too many times to count. The burgers, fries and shakes are the best. The Barney's up here just aren't the same. The menu is the same, but there is something about how it's prepared here that makes it not as good. And I've never, ever had good service (or mediocre service for that matter) at a Barney's in the Bay Area. I know Barney's started here, but it's just not what I'm used to..."
115,"I should have known that the gourmet in Barney's Gourmet Burgers meant that place would be over-priced but the Burgers in it made me think twice. I should have went with my first instinct but I was hungry and the Cheeseboard was closed. Well, at least I know now to go with my instinct."
116,"Want a burger drowned in toppings?  This is the place.  (If you like that type of thing, add star to this review; I don't.)  Their beef burgers are decent (sometimes even good) -you'll have better luck ordering it medium rare-, but I've never had a piece of chicken here that wasn't overcooked.  They do, however, serve pretty darn tasty fries and onion rings."
117,"two stars for the food. i would have given the food four stars but the service pulled the rating waaaay down. here's some soundbites from my experience. -""please seat yourself"" says the sign at the door. okay. promptly received menus and water. then 20 minutes later was able to order. except we were ready 10 minutes before.-""i'd like that cooked medium, thank you"" i say to the waiter who i can barely understand. ""ok,"" he says, ""well done, right?"" and moves onto my boyfriends order. ""nononono, MEDIUM"" i quickly inject. -my boyfriend hates, wait has a distinct FEAR of condiments, so he asks the waiter, ""what comes on the burger aside from the specialty ingredients listed on the menu?"" the waiter says, ""the regular fixings, lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles."" we both quickly say, ""NO PICKLES"" on our plate. something about pickle juice makes us squeamy. -so we order the curly fries as a ""side"" except it comes out before our food. so shouldn't it be considered an appetizer??? i like my fries with my burger thank you.-we get our food... both of our burgers are cooked well done. we both have pickles on our plate. i immediately took mine off so i wasn't affected too much by the pickle devil juice. but the boyfriend's burger bun was saturated by the pickle. so he called the waiter back and asked for a new one. a WHOLE NEW BURGER. the waiter comes back in 1.5 minutes (the fastest response we got all day), with his burger. he said, ""i gave you a new bun."" uhhh... right. so we just gave in and ate since i was getting a little bitchy from not eating. -fyi... we got the pickle we didn't ask for, but no tomato or red onion on the side. so... thanks for telling us what we get, not giving us what we wanted, and giving us what we specifically said not to give us. sigh... i wanted to like this place. the curly fries are awesome. the burgers, huge and tasty. better if they were cooked medium and not well done. bah."
118,"really, they should just get rid of the gourmet *hamburger* bit, and change it to *curly fries*. that's the reason to go. why mess around with a product that was good in the first place, i.e. the humble burger? and if you are going to mess with it, do it better than barney's have done. i've been here twice, and both times have disappointed. once it was that crappy excuse for a greek burger served with feta cheese inside a pita (just wrong). the second time, something with way too much avocado and over-cooked, fatty, stringy bacon. not wrong this time, just badly done. was i unlucky? maybe. are the other menu items better? undoubtedly. should i be magnanimous and give barney a third chance? never. will i continue to ask myself questions and then answer them? pretty decent odds."
119,this pretty much was my go to hamburger place until they changed their bbq sauce last year.  why? why? why would you do that?  that just doesn't make any sense!  still two stars for the turkish coffee shakes..
