0,Def not up to par with reviews. Chicken tasted like it was sitting in the bottom of a bucket for a week. I will not be coming back :(
1,"Place is really nothing special.  They did have a taco deal on the Tuesday that we went, the typical Taco Tuesday.  Tacos are $2 and they also had sangria for $4 along with that deal.  The tacos were extremely small as were the sangria offerings so the deal was more of you pay for what you get kind of scenario.  The dishes we ordered were the quesadilla and the nachos.   Nachos were okay portion wise but had nothing special wth the taste, faux is extra $$.  The quesadilla was pretty small and lacking filling wise as well.  For good Mexican food, I'd much rather just stick to Mission, haven't found a good alternative near me yet in Berkeley."
2,Got my order wrong the soup is disgusting I ordered a Cuban sandwich that was not a Cuban sandwich So I'm back on the hut.. for this Cuban sandwich.
3,Food was cold and beans were from a can.I feel like I can't trust Yelp anymore. Who is giving this place 5 star reviews?$36 down the drain.
4,Quality went down and price went up after current ownership took over this restaurant. I got food poisoning here twice. I haven't had the guts to come back since.
5,"Torta sandwich ham was essentially overstuffed with lettuce and unseasoned guacamole, with two thin slices of ham. Beans taste from a can. Tamale is extremely dry, and that's even with the supremely sour tomatillo and sour cream. Pico de gallo was tasteless. I hate wasting food but this was terrible -- left most of my plate full."
6,"$14 for a breakfast burrito is robbery. Unless it has a 6 oz filet mignon in it, this place is priced way too high for the neighborhood. If they dropped it to $10 that's even higher than their competition."
7,"Let's talk about Taco Tuesday. $2 tacos! Bring a magnifying glass and tweezers, because they're the smallest tacos you'll ever try to eat. Now that I think about it, maybe it's worth coming for Taco Tuesday to marvel at how one can make a taco this small. Also $30 for a pitcher of sangria which is mostly juice is like a punch in the throat.The service is friendly and the food is not so bad, but if you come for sangria and tacos on a Tuesday you'll leave $50 light, hungry, without a buzz, and in the moral conundrum of wondering if you patronized a place that may have small children tied up in the back being forced to make wee tacos."
8,"If I could give a 0 star If I would. Do not come here and pay for a plate of food and expect to get rice and beans. Oh,  unless you want to pay extra for it and get you own forks,  chips and salsa, napkins and salt....because the food NEEDS salt and flavor!!!! I payed 100$ for a family of 5 and I served myself. Small portions and NOT authentic Mexican food!!!  Beans tasted canned, as well as the chili verde sauce.  For the price, definitely not worthy."
9,"Usually really like this place but I ordered a carnitas burrito and got beef, which I didn't like at all. By the time I got home and cut into it was too late to take it back because they were closed. Now I have to check my burrito before I leave. My my dinner for the night really suck"
10,"UPDATE -  Went back for a second try. Service is still not great. There is absolutely no cellular service,  even near the window, and WiFi is not offered. The layout is a hot mess. The register is situated in such a way that it cocks up entry and egress of the establishment, as well as access to the pastries. Food is good, not great, but good.      =====================================Servers were not friendly, and were unwilling to add chopped onions to vegetarian burrito.Was charged $27+ for two burritos and two bottle Cokes. Complementary tortilla chips are NOT provided before or with the meal.Food was average."
11,My experience today may be a fluke but I had to write.I usually think this place is a solid 4/5. Today I tried the pupusas. One pork & cheese and one bean & cheese.  Casa Latina forgot to put anything in the middle. I was very disappointed in my dry pupusas. What made it worse is they charge $2.90 each! That's just silly. My fiancé ordered his usual carnitas plate. He got boiled pork-not carnitas. He claimed his beans were unflavored. Womp.
12,"Note: this review is for Taco Tuesday only.Went here for Taco Tuesday. $2 for really small tacos (single shell, but the meat was good), $4 for beer (bottle, not draft). Although I haven't been here for any of the other meals, this was not the best Taco Tuesday experience. I feel the price was not representative of the value output. There are significantly better Taco Tuesday alternatives out there."
13,"Went in with my husband and a friend and we ordered Maduros to start, chicken enchiladas, carne asada burrito, and a pork torta. All of the meat was dry and had very little flavor. The Maduros were soggy and unflavorful.  Aside from the fact that the food was underwhelming to say the least, the service was not good either. I asked for a lime with my corona and was told to wait and they would bring me one. Then after waiting for honestly five minutes I sat down and the busser brought me two lime wedges cut too large to put them in my beer bottle covered in cheese? It was so gross. I went up to get silverware once we got our food and they had no knives out so I asked the woman behind the counter and was told to wait. Waited for about 3 mins and then sat down since my food was there and I didn't want it to get cold. Then, she brought them out and just put them away and brought out more food. It was just kind of strange since she walked by my table, knew I had asked for a knife - just a lack of customer service and hospitality which I was surprised by.On top of that, they brought out the wrong burrito to my husband but he was starved and we were annoyed by the whole situation so he started to eat it. The lady from the front came back with his actual burrito and then he said Oh yeah that's mine and she went to take it back instead of correcting the situation.Really frustrating experience and spent $60 which I thought was way overpriced for the quality of the food - I wouldn't recommend this place."
14,"It's ok but too spicy. The food is edible but it's too spicy. The horchata is tasty. But the sauce on the enchiladas is too spicy. I think it would be better to they offered a mild sauce, but all of the sauces, green and red and very spicy as in super hot, burn your mouth off hot! and if your taste buds are burning you can't taste the food. Just my opinion. I would come back but unfortunately, the food is too spicy."
15,"Ah, Casa Latina, you have broken my heart. I usually follow Thumper's advice: ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."" In this case, however, I just have to speak my mind.For over five years you were my only taco shop. Every time the taco bug bit I drove across the East Bay to indulge in your gigantic delicious tacos. I boasted to anyone and everyone about the mounds of fork tender carne asada grilled in olive oil, sprinkled with fresh cilantro, crisp onions and topped with zippy salsa. Everything you made was filling, fresh, and delicious, never skimpy, never greasy. Two tacos were a meal, three a feast.Flash forward to last week. The carne asada has turned into hard grilled pebbles of meat. The salsa is runny and weak. I'm not sure how you're cooking the meat but it definitely didn't feel light and healthy. The price of the tacos has increased and the size decreased. The new tacos made me very sad, like when a good friend moves away. Now I have no taco shop.You have a great new dining room and the most beautiful bathroom I've ever seen in a taco shop. Those changed are good. Please bring back your original tacos. I miss my taco shop."
16,"Descent food. Not the best for the price. Iv had way better for a lot less. But hey this place has a ton of good reviews, maybe I'm wrong . Give a try for yourself."
17,I come here in a regular basis because I like there aqua de horchata... today I had the worst experience ever the chunky lady that deliveries the food to the table is so rude I asked for napkins and lime.. she was going to bring it to my table it never happened.. I order flautas and a horchata came out to be around $20 if they are going to charge so much for their food I at least expect good service never returning again
18,I haven't lived in the East Bay for three years and was visiting. This used to be my favorite taco spot and their nacatamals were so good. New owners changed the menu. No Nicaraguan food. No slow cooked meats. No where near the quality. So sad. Probably won't be back.
19,I love mexican pastries. This place had it long time ago. It was expensive back then. But it was good.... and good size breads. Now they are expensive and it lacks of good flavor. I'm mexican and I know when good mexican bread is there. Way To expensive for the size of bread 1.60 when others are from .75 to .90Same flavor as any maxican bakeryAnd tres leches cake really? My wife pitch it to the garbage after taste it. That good was it? For 4.50? What a waste. Really don't fall a sleep in your laurels just because some will rate you good that doesn't mean you are good enough.They might have good service. But if u have no good food.... the good service doesn't make it up... I used to recommend this place..... now I will not.
20,"No refills on coffee for dine in customers anymore (key word: ""customers"")!?!? That's like blasphemy for a ""restaurant"" and they don't even fill the cup all the way and charge $2.25!!!! Poor decision by owners. You don't mess around when it comes to coffee drinkers. If you have people who abuse the refill system, you should address them individually with a limit if they sit there all day siphoning your coffee supply.They remodeled and it looks way nicer now, sure, but where's the heart of this place? The thing that makes people come back to support your business? It's sad... Manager wasn't in and staff didn't seem to care, saying it was out of their hands. Staff said the menu is changing. Did the owners change too? Foods ok. I really miss the natacamals. Casa Latina just lost two regulars. I hope they see the evil in their ways and make adjustments."
21,"Another great authentic neighborhood resturant bites the dust. It's twice as ""nice"" on the inside and the food is now 1/2 as good. Carnitas cooked to a leathery consistency and unseasoned. Guacamole and sour cream tasteless and from a can, salsa fresca bland and I'm pretty sure every veggie on my plate in anything was delivered by sysco. Service was not terrible because it was mostly absent. Table was dirty. I didn't try a pastery because I want any remaining memory of this place to be good. May as well just change the name to Chipolte, this place used to be where food was made with love not a can opener.You get 1 star new owners, because you can't ruin a Mexican Coke and the art on the walls was at least pretty good."
22,"I'm very disappointed w/ Casa Latina pricing. I go there mainly for the Pan Dulce, and primarily for their yummy chocolate chip cookies.  For forever I've been buying them for 60 cents which is a great value. In fact as recently as Valentine's Day I doled over my .60 for this sweet for my sweetie (he loves 'em).  Tonight I went to get one and was quite surprised when the guy at the counter ringing me up charged me $1.10 for it. I really wanted cookies so I payed up. When I asked why it's so much he told me that the Pan Dulce vary in price, and that the cookies that are with colored sprinkles are .60 but the big round chocolate chip cookies are $1.10.  When I told him I always buy it for 60 cents, he just shrugged his shoulders.  I was too tired and hungry to argue with him or ask for his supervisor so I just walked out very disappointed and will probably be telling my friends & neighbors about my experience should they ask me about this place. ;-("
23,Don't go here my husband and I have food poisoning from eating their pasole and burrito. Horrible experience. No one is there to be answerable to this issue. THIS PLACE SHOULD SHUT DOWN!
24,"Every pastry tastes the same. And, one of the guy employees looks at you like a hungry dog for a tip."
25,"I came here during lunch and it wasn't very busy.  The inside is very nice, clean, nice clean bathroom.  I ordered a burrito, very clearly.  Carne asada burrito with everything, then I listed the items I wanted included just to be extra clear, black beans, rice, pico de gallo, guac, cheese, sour cream.  I got the burrito and walked back to my car.  Upon biting into it I found the burrito was missing salsa, sour cream and the guac I had been charged extra for.  I walked back with my partially consumed burrito (it cost well over $10 for the burrito so I expect what I pasig for). I stood at the counter with my burrito out, having just been in 5 minutes ago and was intentionally ignored by 3 women who were working in the immediate area.  I had to literally flag someone down and force eye contact to get some help.  When I told he woman that my burrito was missing stuff she tried to say I didn't order it when she didn't even take my order.  I know what I ordered, I ordered clearly and specifically.  She begrudgingly took the burrito and went to the kitchen (which is in plain site). She proceeded to speak rudely in Spanish about me ( yes, I understand you and speak Spanish as well) to the kitchen staff.  I Waited as the glared at me and talked sh*** .I should have just asked for a refund.  Rude, rude, rude.  I won't be back."
26,"Three friends and I ate here for lunch on Sunday, June 14. My bill came to $15, which I remember clearly because it seemed surprisingly high for what I had ordered. As I do not tip for takeaway, I signed the slip and went on my merry. The next morning I saw that Casa Latina had actually authorized my card for more than $18. I checked with my friends and they had also been overcharged by a similar amount.I returned the next day and (clearly, patiently) asked the restaurant to please correct the mistake. The staff were evasive and refused to help me in any way. They did not seem particularly shocked by the accusation, either.To summarize: multiple members of our party were overcharged in the span of ten minutes. Restaurant refused to right the wrong. Draw whatever conclusion you want from that.Update: To Juan (the owner): I have better things to do than fabricate random stories about how the ninth-best Mexican restaurant in Berkeley stiffed me for three bucks. I am dead certain as to what happened. Spend your $1000 on hiring honest employees.Update #2: The charge on my credit card has magically reduced to the correct amount. Also, the owner Juan messaged me threatening to sue if I did not take down this review. After I finished laughing, I edited it to contain just the facts as they happened, and no personal opinions."
27,Mediocre food. We got nachos and the Cuban sandwich. It was edible. But the nachos cost $12 with carnitas (+$2) and guacamole(+$1.50). They were $5 nachos at best. Like the kind of food you would get at a high school sporting event. The bathroom is like a dungeon. Too dark. Altogether not a great experience. Overpriced for what you get.
28,"Nothing authentic about this place, it's over priced Mexican food trying to pander to the American palette."
29,"late lunch in the 'tweener hours... so shockingly bad....we were eating in disbelief. Empanada de puerco was so dry... the shredded meat was dessicated, and the crust was flat flat flat.. no buttery flakiness to be found, anywhere. My tostada was more lettuce than anything. They didn't even bother draining out the liquid from the black beans; hence, what would have been a crispy corn shell disc was a soggy mess. His chicken tacos looked so bland.....Not what we were hoping for, which was pretty simple: flavor. Shoulda done taco truck by Hotsy Totsy instead---"
30,"$16 for a pastry, 2 tamales, 1 papusa, and a soda. Wanted to try it since it was one of the few Mexican places I haven't tried. Too much masa not enough filling. The plating was amazing and so was the hot sauce but lack of flavor."
31,"Decor and whatnot are nice, but the food lacked soul. And by that, I mean it caters to people who are afraid of flavor and spice. Everything was beyond bland and the Oaxacan tamales were a massive disappointment. Very dry and had the texture of old and desiccated idli, the South Indian food. Wrong wrong wrong. Masa should be creamy. Meat was flavorless, salsas were useless. On a hilarious note, we came in with a large group and a person who worked there was seated at our table for some reason. It was a cute little Cold War of sorts. We are a friendly bunch (she was decidedly not) but next time, vamoose. Odd.Eating here is a waste of time and money, to be frank. But maybe the pastries are good? Still, there are hundreds of better Mexican places around. Here's one in the area: Tacubaya."
32,"Love the interior of this place! Could be a nice study space if they have wifi. I ordered the carnitas burrito, which tasted very healthy and bland.  The best part was the chips.  Hopefully the pastries will not disappoint as well..."
33,"2 tacos de papa-Potato, and a coke was 10 bucks. 30 mins later in an empty restaurant and I'm Still waiting?  You've Got to be kidding me. This isn't the first time I've waited too long for this place. Never again"
34,This place has been completely remodeled. There is a lot more space with a larger dining area. The food was good. THEY DONT HAVE COFFEE REFILLS $2.25 for a cup of coffee only 2/3 full is a deal breaker for me! Probably won't be back.
35,I went to this four star restaurant and ordered a fish taco. The taco was tiny bits of fish with lots of veggies on corn tortillas. I wonder what happened to the fish. If they were out of fish they should let you know. The rice was cold and the black beans were bland .
36,Terrible food poisoning me and my boyfriend both experienced! Our friend ate here a few weeks later and also got food poisoning! Beware!
37,"1 year ago I would have given them 4 stars.  Something happened.  I went there today and got carne asada and al pastor tacos.  For both, the meat was underseasoned and overcooked....dry and flavorless.  In addition, the carne asada tasted a little fishy.  I'm not sure what happened, but I don't remember it being this bad.  I hope it changes for the better."
38,"Darn! I was hopeful that the new owners would not completely destroy everything about this great neighborhood taqueria. First to go were some of the delightful employees, then the cozy atmosphere, but alas the food was still the same. But now, they switched form their incredibly tasty, grilled  chicken to bland, chopped-up, over-cooked tasteless chicken. At about $8 for a chicken burrito, why bother? After being a regular for about four years, and having given the new owners a chance, I too will be spending my money elsewhere."
39,"Two stars for the decor and service. Half star for the food. Ordered the poached eggs on toast with avocado and spinach salad. Eggs-hard as rubber. Toast-1 inch thick with burned edges and raw center. Spinach-right out of the bag with no dressing. Bland, boring and overpriced."
40,"Mexican pastries typically taste like bad bread encrusted with chunks of sugar, and Casa Latina doesn't distinguish itself in this regard. I had a few tasty burritos there some years back and thought I would enjoy them again. I've eaten there three or four times in the last couple of months, and have found the food to be generally adequate, even tasty in some ways. Still, it isn't worth the price. A burrito is $8, for example. Where I'm from, a burrito is generally $5. Sometimes you luck into a $3.50 burrito, (e.g. Little Pablo just two blocks down San Pablo) and often those taste just as good. Sometimes you pay $6.50 and the place gives you something a little special. Not so with the Casa Latina $8 burrito. I tried different things, thinking that it was just a matter of trial and error before I figured out which particular dishes are worth the premium price. Meh, not by my standards."
41,"Green chicken tamales were disappointing. I see one reviewer here says they offer more than one kind. Whatever kind they served me, they were 5/6 cornmeal, with a sliver of chicken in the middle. As I got the plato with rice and beans, I ended up with a whole lot of carb and very little to flavor it. Ended up leaving most of it there. At around $9, a pretty lousy value.Doesn't reflect on the rest of the menu, but I'm not inclined to try other offerings, based on that experience."
42,"i tried this place on a sunday after they were featured by a yelp email i received.  it was very disappointing.  i ate the super nacho with carne asada with a glass of watermelon aqua fresa.  i don't remember the exact total but at less $15.  that's quite expensive.  you are definitely paying for the atmosphere.  love frida, but it's definitely a gentrified taqueria."
43,"The tacos are solid tacos. They are not going to change your world. Sadly if you are frequenting this stretch of San Pablo, that might be what you need. The neighborhood, specifically this block is full of shady people, most likely due to Bing's Liquors next door. Be prepared. Two tacos are not $2 as you might suspect from a quick glance at the menu. No, it's two tacos for $2.30 each which means you get one taco for $2 or two for around $5 after tax. I call bullshit on that. If you don't want onions, apparently you should be explicit. Mentioning that as you order doesn't count. Also the hot salsa is pretty much hot sauce, a distinction that might be lost on many but here? really? Also they do not have carry-out containers. You will receive a plate with foil over it, and a plastic bag if you wish. Your chips may be soggy when you get back to work or home. It's not a good system. Overall, I'm bummed not so much with the food but with the whole experience. I'd return but only out of desperation. Qué lastima."
44,Skippy on the meat up charged me for everything.. Much better places to go in Berkeley and Albany.
45,"This rating is purely based on their pastries:Cheap, tough and overly sweet.I have nothing more to say about their pastries.I hear their ""real food"" is great, however."
46,"I lived for 20 years in SF's Mission District and then lived for awhile in Central Mexico, so I think it's safe to say that I've eaten a LOT of Mexican food, some good, some bad, some authentic, some not so much. After reading the other reviews, I was expecting at least good things from this place. I definitely wasn't expecting what I got! First, I ordered a carne asada quesadilla suiza. I liked that it automatically came with crema and guacamole as well as having the salsa fresca and salsa verde on the side. It looked meaty and smelled great. but... What I most certainly didn't like was the enormously salty carne! Dear God, I have never encountered anything that unexpectedly salty since the time Aunt Nancy dropped the salt shaker in the turkey soup and didn't tell anyone until we sat down to eat! Maybe the cook had an accident. I surely hope so and that they don't routinely feed Berkeley a month's dose of sodium with every entre! I managed to eat lunch by dumping out most of the meat (yes, there was a lot) and dousing the remains in the unsalty condiments and crema.Okay, the I tackled the custard empanada. These are, from living in the Mission, one of my favorite baked items on the planet. There are a couple of panaderias on 24th St that make empanadas particularly well. Sadly, Casa Latina was NOT up to that level. The pastry was over process and over baked so that it was hard, dry and crumbly. I mean, I had to break it using both hands! Lots of custard inside, which was nice, but what the heck is it made out of? It tasted like nothing natural, more like it was made from thickened antifreeze! Yuck. I should have tried the cochas instead!I guess I'm just going to have to keep going into the city if I want good pastry and decent Mexican. At least I don't have to go all the way back to Guanajuato!"
47,"Had lunch here about a week ago.  I chose the tacos with carnitas.  Not a good choice.  There were so many large chunks of fat that there was more fat than meat in my tacos.  Might try the place again, but definitely not the carnitas.  The agua fresca was also excessively sweet."
48,"If this is considered the best tacos in the east bay, that bodes very very ill for the east bay. I moved up to Berkeley from Los Angeles two weeks ago and decided to begin my quest for some decent tacos here at Casa Latina Bakery. Very disappointed. Tried their carne asada tacos as well as the chicken fajita burritos and both were fairly mediocre. The hot sauce was pretty weak as well. None of the food was BAD. It all tasted ok, but nothing special. Ate the food and afterwards thought, ""eh."" The place does get points for having very friendly service. The girl at the counter was nice about explaining the menu to us."
49,"Friendly but slow service. Went after reading the many great reviews on Yelp only to be disappointed. The nachos were massive, which they should have been for $8. Food had ZERO spice despite requesting ""hot"" salsa. The carne asada burrito was bland. The baked goods are not that great, but better than those you can get in the supermarket. The churros look great, but unfortunately I did not have the chance to try one."
50,"This is one of those places that's so convenient, I come here even though I don't like the food. The carnitas might be the worst I've ever had. They're so tough, stringy, and dry that they scratch your throat on the way down. The refried beans taste like they're straight outta the can, and the rice is repulsive. If you get your burrito with rice, it's pretty much a rice burrito; you won't taste anything else. Don't eat the rice!!The pan dulce are dry and bland for the most part. The one exception (depending what time you get it) is that coconut covered jammy one that looks like a hostess snowball. That one's pretty good sometimes.Casa Latina is my bakery/taqueria with benefits. Damn you Casa Latina for being right across the street from my favorite bar and on my way to work! I feel so dirty using you like this. I know I'm friendly to your face and pretend to like you better than the rest, but the truth is I'm just not that into you."
51,"I went there years ago and had a decent burrito, although I remember it having too much rice.  I've been back a couple of times in the last couple of weeks after my Mom mentioned I should check it out.  Burritos are just ok, and expensive at $8+.  The biggest problem is that they don't know what carne asada / steak is.  The first time I went I asked for carne asada and I got shredded / braised beef that quite honestly was pretty flavorless, my wife actually ordered and I thought there'd been a mix up or something.  Second time I went I asked for carne asada and again I got shredded beef.  I went up to the counter to ask if this was indeed carne asada or shredded beef, the guy who made my burrito didn't know, so then a girl behind the counter showed me a sample of shredded beef and said that I didn't have shredded beef.  I pointed out that the shredded beef she showed me looked the exact same as the meat in my burrito.  So I asked to see what the carne asada looked like, she then showed me another meat she claimed was carne asada / steak and lo and behold it was shredded beef again.  I told her it was unlike any steak I'd ever seen and went back to my table.  Shame on them for trying to tell me that their braised beef is steak, if all they want to offer is braised beef then that's fine, they should say so and not claim they're serving steak."
52,"Glad to know that there are $2 tacos and tamales outside of Fruitvale. But, they're just so-so. I'll be back once to check out the pastries, might rethink my review after that."
53,"I came to write a review to warn people away from this place and find that people love it. Shock! Here's the contrarian point of view.How can you make a bad churro? I don't know but you can ask at Casa Latina, they have the secret. These are the nastiest pastries I have ever had and/or seen (and I've been to Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas/Nebraska). They are an acquired taste - the acquired taste of canned syrupy fruits, too much shortening (and we're not talking about butter) and too much sugar. Fortunately there's free water at the counter so you can start trying to remove the film of fat from your tongue while you're still in the store. The burritos are DF-authentic, made on industrial scale George Foreman grills with super-over-cooked meats, lots of added oil and, with some grilled peppers and onions, they cost $7.50 (as of 12/2007). Get the ""tomatoes"" because they, surprisingly, taste good.Shockingly, the coffee is actually decent."
54,"The people are nice, and the place is cute, but the pan dulces all taste similar and I can quit after a bite."
