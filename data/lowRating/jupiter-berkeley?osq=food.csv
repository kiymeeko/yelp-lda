0,"Great food and beer... BUT...The bouncer/ door man was trying to pick up on my girlfriend as we walked in...Took my ID... look at me then look at my girlfriend in back at me and laughed and said ""you need to get your girlfriend away from me she's way too pretty."" While uncomfortably staring her down maintaining direct eye contact... No laughs, no joking, no compliment... Dude was trying to run game. I told him I'm the luckiest man in the world and he rolled his eyes at me as we walked in and kept staring at my girlfriend.As if this wasn't enough great ""customer service, the experience got even more awkward. There was a live band outside and I got up to dance! Yayyyyy right? Our food runner, some guy with a big beard , who was being condescending to me all night waiting for me to get up and leave the table and told my girlfriend. "" I think you are so pretty, but let's just keep that between me and you"" ... Wow.On the way out the same bouncer locked I contact with my girl as soon as we walked out of the door in the hallway waiting for her to walk pass and stop me and asked if I was still the luckiest man in the world? I told him yes and I was blessed. He then focusesed his back on my girl and said ""lucky, blessed...wowwww""Thanks for being complete creeps instead of doing your job and letting us go again. Needless to say we will not be going back and going to one of the many other places where we actually feel welcome and arw note with thirsty lustful men. Sad... I really liked this place. Bye Bye Jupiter, please train your employees to be more respectful, welcoming and kind."
1,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2,Crappy service. My wife an I sat in our table for more that 15 minutes never got our order taken while the family that came 10 minutes after us got their order taken as soon as they sat them down. We decide to get up an just walk out this place sucks
3,Pizza was amazing! CUSTOMER SERVICE ONE OF THE WORST. Seating is first come first served. There were at least 6 waiters mingling by the cash register in the outside area by the fire pit. I was sitting down for 15 min before a waiter came over to hand us menus. Another waiter came over 10 minutes later to take our order. This guy had zero personality. He didn't even smile when he greeted us. Management please train your employees to keep socializing with coworkers to a minimum and spend more time actually interacting with customers. Won't be back no matter how good the pizza was.
4,"Great food but terrible service. Being a waiter is a difficult job, especially if you are working on a Sunday, so I try to be a polite customer and understand if waiters can be a little curt at times.My server was rude in leading us to our table and serving us drinks. But he crossed the line when he hit me as he was walking by. It was his arm, so he must have felt it, but yet he did not apologize. That said, the food was great. Simple and delicious. But I will not be coming back because of the service."
5,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
6,WARNING! Check your Bank Account after you leave this Clip Joint! This place uses unethical practice's . I was in their on July 15th and paid the bill with my Debt card. I left a cash tip. A few days later I was online checking my account and my server J Llach looks to take it upon himself to add a tip of $6.00 to my bill.. WTF!! Pay by cash or you are going to get ripped off! Will be contacting the BBB about there shady practices...
7,"This review is not about the service or the food, since I could not try any of those. This review is to let people know that the hours posted on Yelp may or may not be accurate. The kitchen closes at 11PM according to the doorman, well before the 12:30am posted time. And the bar closes as needed, depending on how busy they are. This is fair, but still not the advertised hours."
8,"We decided that we wanted to try this place out while we were visiting Berkeley. Bad idea, the place was packed. we didn't see a hostess anywhere so we sat down. Then the hostess came over and said there was a 40 minute wait ( I didn't see anyone waiting)  and that we should go outside. We went outside and there was nowhere to sit, so we left. We felt pretty dumb and awkward, looked like a cool place though. Oh well."
9,"Honestly, if you ain't drinking don't come. Don't bother for food. We got burned wings, told our waiter, then got raw wings. Cherry on top, waiter got the nerve to ask about her tip. Yo, food service was wack. Don't bother please."
10,"FYI this place is NOT dog friendly, but there seems to be some confusion. Came in with our pups, the waiter commented on how cute they were and then brought us water for the dogs. Drank some beer and ate food (a little slow but they were slammed) and everything was great. The owner/manager came over and says actually dogs aren't allowed. That would have been fine if they told us at the beginning, but after being there an hour it was a little off putting. Great spot, but definitely not one to bring the pups unless they change the policy. Note: We sat on the raised patio, at least 10+ feet from any other customer. Our pups weren't loud, and several patrons came up to pet them during our visit."
11,"Jupiter has definitely changed. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE OLD PICTURES!!!! The quality of the pizza has definitely gone down. Their concern about taste and quality is over. This used to be a GREAT place to eat. My favorite spinach and artichoke dip is now artificially colored green in a small container and not as tasty. I ordered the Circe pizza which in the past was delicious garlic buttered, shrimp, cheesy and delicious -- it's just not the same. The pizza that I had was quickly thrown together with no butter and a bunch of garlic, plain tasteless shrimp barely any cheese. I was so disappointed. Got to scratch Jupiter off the list of go to places for food this is only a drinks place.The only thing that has improved to me was the pomegranate cider it was delicious! Used to be to sour."
12,"Ugh, my waiter spent more time macking on the girls at the table next to our than he did serving us. The pizza, simple pepperoni, took a full hour to show up. Thankfully, he comped is for the wait, but still I was too HANGRY by then to forgive this oversight. Moreover, the pizza was just OKAY. It tasted like gourmet Pizza Hut, if such a thing could exist. In the words of 45, ""Jupiter is so overrated. This was loser pizza. Good beer. Such bad pizza. Sad!"""
13,"This place is more about the vibe and location rather than the food itself....It's a beautiful and large space.  I love the design and feel about this place.However, the food and service was disappointing...Ordered two pizzas: Xanthia and Circe.Pizza tasted so bad we all were just sprinkling chili peppers and salt onto it just to down it and leave....Table space is cramped which I could understand given its location, but that gives no reason to be cranky when delivering food and the table is not fully cleared for you....Also, the bus boys kept bumping into my chair was not the least apologetic about it...Saw this place once and am done with it!"
14,"Worst customer service I have ever received ! Our waitress's name was Emina! Her attitude was just awful! They messed up on our order twice and brought out the wrong food, she charged us for items we never actually order or received, my friends order came out 25 minutes before ours did! YES! 25 minutes! We had to beg other servers for drinks and water refills because she never came back after taking our order. We waited for her majesty to show up after 20 minutes of sit there waiting for s check and some boxes! I then called on the manager which was just as bad! Horrible service! Even worst management! What a shame because the atmosphere is amazing !"
15,"Nice outdoor seating, but it must be near a dog park because we would frequently get an intense blast of dog poop smells our outdoor table in the back corner!Food was ok, but limited menu. Just pizzas and I couldn't find an appetizer that looked appealing. My pizza was overdone and dry. Great beer selection!Been there, done that, no need to return."
16,"Great location, decent food, terrible service. My friends and I came here for dinner around 8:00pm on a regular Sunday and found a table easily despite the fact that it was pretty busy. When we placed our orders, the waiter asked if my friend wanted his salad to arrive around the same time as our pizzas. We were beyond shocked to hear that the pizza would take anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes. We each ordered drinks and I ordered the honey wheat beer. Definitely a good taste if you're into wheat beers! After a while, we checked the time and our food hadn't come out yet and we had hit the 45 minute mark. We asked our waiter where our food was and he said he would check. It came out 5 minutes later. Now I don't know about you, but on a relatively steady night like Sunday I don't expect to wait about 50 minutes for a 13"" pizza. We had ordered Gaia and it was way too subpar for the price and the wait. I definitely do not recommend coming out here. For the time it takes for me to get my food id rather take my business elsewhere!"
17,"It prob would of been enjoyable if our pizza wasn't over cooked so it was extremely dry, I had to order ranch to make eatable.. but the ranch was good though..."
18,"As Oakland is going through a revitalization thanks to Yuppy-Hipsters, there's a whole lot of good coming into town.  Unfortunately, some businesses are remaining lackluster & this is one of them.  While they do offer (at best) mediocre live music, it does not do the amount of overcompensation necessary to overcome the immense disappoint from food, alcohol, & ambiance. This is the rare instance when the general population will benefit from some independently wealthy schmuck coming in an turning things around.  I will return then."
19,"Place is absolutely awesome!! Sit outside by the fire pit where you can get a beautiful view of the exterior bldg which seems like your not in Oakland anymore....they have seating everywhere and cute lights that are strung all over the place...perfect for warm summer night!! Unfortunately I wish I could say the same for the food...we ordered at about 9:15pm plate of ribs from the appetizer side at about 9:45 we flagged our waiter down and asked how long it's gonna take? he finally brought it out and it was super cold!! We told him and he said ""I do believe it""? Hmmm so we gave it another try again the ribs come out and this time it's warm!...ok so we just order our pizza as the kitchen closes at 10pm...it took another 30min for our pizza...our order was simple a pepperoni pizza why is it taking so long?!?! My 2 stars are for the exterior seating I love fire pits!!...hopefully you all get better food service then we did! /:"
20,"What a dreadful place. My wife and I went their Saturday night (1/21/17); The beer was fine but my wife's wine was horrible.We ordered the chicken wings-I've never seen such microscopic, fleshless little scraps. But the asparagus was even worse-suggestion, cut off the hard woody ends. That gastronomic disaster have me indigestion and my wife the poohs.Go hungry and be glad you didn't spend your hard earned money at Jupiter."
21,"Came here for lunch around 230pm on Saturday. Was told to wait outside but no server showed up. When the server did showed up, denied inside seating despite it is raining outside. Wasted 20minute waiting and we ended up walking out.Never coming back here. Would not recommend anyone."
22,"Ok so I went here yesterday hoping to have better experience than last time, but nooo. My friend and I both ordered pizzas (Circe is my FAVORITEEEE! Which is why I keep coming back.) Any how, 20 minutes passed by and I got my pizza, my delicious pizza, I nearly finished half of my pizza before realizing my friend didn't get his. Meanwhile, three tables after us got their pizzas. We continued to wait, and wait, then when we were told that someone was checking on it, we decided to just ask for it in a to go box. We didn't even get an apology from our waiter, it was a great dinner gone wrong. And then when they bring the check they want to be all nice. The pizza really deserves 5-stars. Will I come back? Well... yes, just for Circe, and probably order for takeout this time."
23,"I would give this place a 4 or 5 stars if the service was near ""simply good"". Unfortunately, it did not meet any of my expectations. There was a wait which we were fine with but when we were seated, we had to wait half an hour for utensils and beverages and it wasn't even that busy, there were only 5 occupied tables on the entire second floor. When we did ask for utensils, the girl handing out the utensils seemed irritated that we asked her and not the server who was helping us out. The server was OK, was nice, checked on us whenever needed but we felt rushed later in the evening. I guess because he had to clock out or something?... I'm not sure what it was.The artichoke dip was Divine, it was warm and creamy so we were happy with that appetizer order. The pizza was great! I'm not big on Pizza but this place had the best pizza I've had so far in the East Bay. We had the large half/half of the Gaia and the Circe Pizza, which was perfect for 3 people. Despite the somewhat upsetting service and aura which we could have gotten better in other restaurants down the block, the food and the ambiance was great. I would definitely come back for the food and probably have it outside in the Patio. Over all the Food was Awesome however, the Service sucked."
24,"Do you like hair in your pizza? Me neither. But I found three long black strands in my wood-fired Odysseus pizza. Gross.Otherwise I like Jupiter. Great outdoor seating, exceptional beer selection. But I will not be ordering food from here again."
25,"It may have been just a bad day but I was amazed by the terrible service. Took them half an order until they even came to take our orders. When my friend asked someone for some water (a random waiter because ours had gone MIA) he basically said ""Yeah I have other customers ask someone else bye"" and ran off. Drinks were great and the food was good but I haven't had service that bad in a WHILE."
26,"The service is horrible here. I've been here quite  few times, the people don't acknowledge your presence, and they messed up my order every time I've been here. The pizza is okay but I prefer Zachary's or Slivers more. I enjoy the outdoor environment at night with the lights and fire, and the white wine is decent. Other than that, I do not like this place that much. It is good for groups as they have large tables in door but the service is so bad that if you come with a large group  they will mess up your order or it will take a long time !"
27,"When we first walked in, it seemed like a really awesome place. Really lovely atmosphere. However, the service was some of the worst I have received in a very long time. After sitting for 10 minutes we had to flag down a waitress. She was not welcoming, wasn't sure if she was just introverted or just didn't want to talk to us. The tables around us kept glancing up for help we noticed, it didn't seem like many were getting the service they needed. Our waitress did not check back with us after we got our food, so we once again had to flag her down to finally get her to come over. At the end, after waiting as patiently as we could, we got another server to finally bring us our check. Bummer, because this place has a lot of potential. Will only be returning for drinks at the bar, where it seemed like the service was actually decent. :("
28,"I came here on a Saturday night after a concert for some drinks and was hoping for something to eat as well. Immediately when we sat down a server came over and said coldly that we would need to order drinks from the bar. A few moments after that, another party sat down at the table next to us and the SAME server walked up to them and took their order happily and brought one of them a special birthday beer or something.. Everyone in my party was so confused as to why we were basically shunned by this dude from the second we sat down when he was clearly serving other people who arrived later than us. We tried to get food around 11:45 and after waiting for a while I walked up to the bar and asked what the deal was and the bartender informed me that they stop serving food at 11, which would have been cool for the server to have told us, especially because we had food menus on our table when we sat down.  The beer was fine, and the atmosphere was nice. I don't live in Berkeley but even if I did i would be unlikely to return just because of this experience."
29,"Went in asked for Marvin, a bartender.I was  looking fir an actual bartender.  Instead I got knob pullers. Went to East Bay spice company where Adam was and found out Marvin was there as well! Amazing amazing"
30,"Expensive food, no gluten free options. Outside dining is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. The patio is nice. I was with a group of 7 talkative women and the manager cut off our drinks after we each had 2 because we were being ""disruptive"". We were animately talking, no one was drunk, and... it's a bar... near campus!  This was after they forgot about our food... we had to remind them after 40 minutes that we still didn't have our meals. No apologies from the staff. There are better places in Berkeley to chill."
31,"The menu here is limited. The wings are good and the pizzas are alright.I came here a few months ago and it was really busy. I was with a group of friends and we were waiting to grab an outside table. We had spoken to one of the staff before. One of my friends accidentally bumped into that staff member and he was unnecessarily rude and essentially told us to not get in his way.  Finally, we got a table and had our dinner. We decided not to tip our server because of that incident.I would say that the service is usually great but why would I pay money to be treated disrespectfully? Nope, no thanks."
32,"We went here for a drink and some food on Friday around 9:00.  We had ordered a Hefeweizen and a Mango Cider and then looked at the menu.  The drinks were fine.  As we looked at the menu which only had pizza options, some horrible guy ran by up the stairs and bumped the ""Seat Yourself"" sign and it hit my wife in the head.  This place has a nice outdoor seating area which is always crowded, but the inside leaves much to be desired.  It was just a bunch of drunk people and poor table placement.  Our server was awesome and comped us a beer, but otherwise this place is pretty unamusing.  So many better options in Berkeley.  The best part about Jupiter is that they have bathrooms."
33,"I always heard that jupiter is such a great restaurant, but whenever I want go there with my family it's the time that they check ID. Me and my family don't drink alcohol at all. In my opinion it doesn't make sense, i came from pleasant hill after my college and they didn't let me in."
34,"Merrr is the word I'd use to describe this place. Yes, the patio is nice, but it's too crowded and the food isn't anything special. Maybe people like it because of the beer pitchers? I can't figure it out. Bike parking out front, but that's really the only plus I can think of for this spot."
35,"The place was beautiful, we sat up stairs and the staff was nice. But I have to share an experience. My friend ordered beer from the bartender and just gave him $1 tip because he planned to go back order more drinks and tip more. When he went back to get more drinks, the bartender, who had spiky hair, said to him ""you're the one who ordered and just gave me $1 tip, not cool man."" And my friend said, I'm sorry dude here's five dollars. And the bartender refused and said I don't even want it anymore. That's so completely rude and uncalled for! Lol why make a big fuss and then not take it. The drinks were just beer."
36,"Beware of golden showers... beer all over me. Oh, and my meal isn't going to be comped. I don't even live in the area"
37,This place went downhill.  I order a mediterranean salad.  How can you mess that up?  The lettuce was wilted and brown.  I sent it back and the super unfriendly waiter didn't even apologize.  I didn't care for the flavors in my salad either.  What a waste of money!
38,We were seated but didn't get help until after the waitress helped 2 other tables who were seated after us. How do you make that mistake? We were seated at a table that she had to pass to help the other 2 tables. How about some drinks? Can we get utensils please? smh C'mon man! The food was good though. Too bad I couldn't remember it because the customer service sucked.
39,"This review is strictly based on this weekends encounter. I have been coming here the past couple months and absolutely love this place. The pizza, beer, service, and atmosphere are 5 star.However this weekend I ordered the shrimp pizza and a pale ale beer and got food positioning. I am assuming it was from the shrimp but it made me deadly sick. I couldn't move, eat, or drink for 24 hours, it was the worse 24 hours of my life. Sadly this will stop me from coming back here again. If it weren't for this encounter this place would be a 5 star. Just be careful and don't order the shrimp pizza."
40,"Slow service. Food was alright. Overpriced. Took about an hour to get our food! We were late to work.I ended up not getting my food, but I tried my friend who did get it in time. The pizza was okay. My friends who ended up getting the sandwich I wanted to order basically got bread with almost nothing in it. Don't order the marinated chicken sandwich!Was also almost charged for things we never got! Thank goodness we looked at the bill.The espresso I got was sub par, but hey I frequent third wave coffee shops.My friends who ordered beers got them and said they were great, so there's a star. Just one...I'd certainly suggest to look elsewhere."
41,The waiter we had a super attitude the servers there was terrible and the salads were horrible in the bruschetta was terrible everything there so that my husband said the waiter had attitude as big as his Jaw
42,"Wife ordered 7 Pizzas and sauces for a Halloween Party we hosted this past weekend. Ordered over the phone for pick up at 4PM. Everything was ready when I got there (so I thought), picked up pizzas and went home. 3 of the 7 pizzas were badly burnt and they charged us for the extra sauces that they never included. (I didn't know about the sauces since my wife placed the order)I've eaten here many times before and never had a bad experience, they were always accommodating since I have garlic allergies. I guess this place is only good for eat in only.Won't be going out of my way to get Pizzas from here anymore.Regret ordering from here... would've had a better experience ordering from Round Table."
43,"Saturday night review. Place was packed and seating took some time, but the hosts where really nice and they got us in quickly. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.  To his credit,  it did look like the waiter was 1 of 2 in the whole indoor area,  again,  on a packed night.  Really though,  there's no reason to be a jerk.  Drink orders were taken right away but he scurried off before we could finish our sentence to him,  rude.  When I asked later if we could order, he told us it looked like we were all busy so he would come back later....  OK.  He came back alright,  but to take the order of the table next to us,  who came in after us. When we decided to go elsewhere I asked for the check and he snatched all the menus from our hands and basically threw the check on the table.  Really awkward experience. Not coming back here. Upside,  looked like they had some good beers and tasty appetizers.  Can't comment on the taste since we didn't get to order,  but looked good from a distance! I did read some fellow Yelper reviews that service at the indoor and outdoor areas are like night and day, so maybe if I come back here, I will try an outdoor seat instead."
44,"This restaurant has 2 faces: the Inside Jupiter, and the Outside Jupiter. They're such different venues they deserve separate reviews... but let's average it out & call it a day, hmm?It's a fun college destination, but the food (which is the same indoors & out) is decidedly bleh. If it's a nice night, the outdoor patio is lovely (especially if you're able to snag a spot next to the fire pit). But try to sit inside and have a real meal & a real conversation, and you will be disappointed. It's impossible to hear anything over the beer-fueled din and thumping music, so you end up shouting ""Whaaaat??"" a lot. Food options are very limited - pizza & salads, nada mas. The pizza is sub-par, salads are overdressed and soggy.In summary:If you want a beer garden on a warm afternoon, Jupiter is great.If you want a pizza place, there are various & better options (let me introduce you to Pizzaiolo: yelp.com/biz/pizzaiolo-o…).If you want to sit inside & chat with a friend over a beer, find another bar!!!"
45,"Disclaimer: I'm not a big fan of pizza, but I can give credit where credit is due. I've been here a couple times to order the pizzas. Somehow, we always end up getting the potato bacon topped pizzas (I don't know the names, they're all named after moons and I can't be bothered to remember which moon = which pizza). It sounds good on paper, but it's the dryest thing ever. I do not recommend! The other pizzas are pretty much ALL dissapointing, except for their Margherita pizza. That's yummy, and I usually order that one if I have a say in what pizzas to get.They only have house beers, so if you're feeling like a bud light, well... too bad, get your uncultured ass out of here. I get their house stout or porter (usually porter because of the higher alcohol content *wink wink*). It's decent, but it taste like all the porters I've ever tried. Maybe I'M the uncultured ass. It's a nice environment and a nice location. Close to the BART station, even though parking is horrendous in this area. I think this would be a go-to hang out spot, especially for Berkeley students who wanna forget about all their academic troubles and/or personal drama. This fits the vibe of Berkeley very well! It's a darn shame that the two things that this place specializes in (pizza and beer), both are unmemorable."
46,"I came here one night with some friends after rehearsal at Berkeley Rep and was introduced to their excellent beer and pizza. Can't remember what pizza I had but it was very well done (that night). Their house ale is quite good as well. It was nice sitting out back, with heating lamps, and having a beer in the summer air. I thought I found a new place to come to on a regular basis!So after this lovely experience, I decided to bring my girlfriend here and see what she thought. First, when my girlfriend showed her ID (from mexico) they did NOT except it. We've been to lots of bars and restaurants around the Bay Area and Los Angeles; they always accept it. For the record you don't need a california ID to drink in california. Not sure if they know that.We ordered a LARGE pizza. When it arrived the pizza was super SMALL. I don't know how many scholars they have working there but the definition of large did not match with the proportions this pizza was having.The overall taste of the pizza was good at best. Def wasn't the pizza I had before. It was not worth the pricey 20 plus dollars they charged us and when I spend that much on pizza, I want A LOT OF FOOD. Not the minimum amount. Baffles me because pizza is relatively cheap to make!I asked the busser if this was the correct size because it looked a bit small. He asked if I wanted a RULER....Again... *sigh... I've heard it all in restaurants but I've never been told that.I said, after a very long pause, ""no thank you.""The waitress came back and i asked her the same thing.And again she asked me if I wanted a ruler to measure the pizza.Lady I get it I'm a customer complaining about the food but how do you expect to get the most out of me and my wallet by saying things like that to customers? Do customers actually say, ""Oh why didn't I think of that! Can you bring me a ruler!?""Be kind, professional and informative with your customers.Don't insult them.Don't patronize them.Inconsistent Food.WORST SERVICE IN BERKELEY!!!!!!!!!"
47,"I ordered a vegan pizza. It took a half an hour for the order to arrive, and the crust was completely charred. I couldn't even eat parts of it, even though I wanted to, since I was still hungry. It also had very few toppings on it, so they were skimping on their ingredients at that time.So, in short, the worst pizza I've had in my life. Also the worst service. She didn't take our order for 15 minutes, and later we had to ask the waitress three times for the check. The ambiance is nice, though, so 2 stars for that."
48,The food isn't good. The place is mainly just hyped. You'll also wait an hour before getting it. Shame because the waiter was nice.
49,"This is for the food ( my ordered item only).The Appetizer Bruschetta was disgusting! Un Toasted bread completely drenched by the marinated tomatoes, with an almost complete lack of cheese. If there was olive oil somewhere in it it was overwhelmed by the vinegary bitterness. Yuck!"
50,"Just was there this afternoon. The ambience is great but one thing needs to be cleared up in Yelp. There is NO happy hour at Jupiter. Here on Yelp in their about section in says they have happy hour and that should be corrected cuz according to the waiter today ""our beers are already cheap."" Also they have some weird policy about not splitting the bill....its just annoying when at the end of hanging out with a large group of ppl and no one has cash its very inconvenient.  Other places make it sooooo easy..."
51,We got there at slightly before 10:30 and they told us the kitchen was already closed. They claim that they open till 1am. They should serve food at least till 11.
52,"great beer and best patio in berkeley. the food is marginal, at best. sad, given the venue and the brewery. this is the third visit in a row i sent a salad back for its sliminess. it's california FCS. what gives with the lame produce?"
53,"I keep coming back because of its proximity to BART for an impromptu beer after work, but since Jupiter changed management a few years ago, the service has really gone downhill, so I don't bother ordering food anymore, which is a big red flag for me.They have a decent selection of beer, but they're often out of something or another, so check with your server.Seating can be tough on the patio, so you have to vulture and be aggressive the moment someone starts putting their jacket on, otherwise you're out of luck.Protip: if you're in a hurry, pass. If you need to get your check, do it at least 10 minutes in advance, as the wait staff has a tough time keeping track of who needs what.The good: they have beer.The bad: I don't trust the service to order anything else."
54,"Arrived here around 5:30 on a Friday with my significant other. We asked the host how long the wait was for a table inside and he said ""about 15 mins"". He asked for my #, letting me know that I'd receive a text when the table was ready. We then got a drink at the bar and walked to the back patio area (which is 1st come 1st serve, btw). Waited, waited, waited...30, 45, 60 mins. I finally walked up to the front and asked what the deal was. Apparently a table for two hadn't opened up yet.  OK, so don't say 15 mins if it's going to be over an hour!!! And maybe send an update via text to let us know there was a delay &/or apologize for the delay! I walked back to the patio, relayed the info to my S.O., and we decided to leave. Oh, and we never receive a text! Very poor experience / customer service."
55,"Pizza is absolutely amazing, but waiting over an hour for pizza is pathetic at 2PM. They didn't even have any of their taps available. They were relying on other breweries... But above all else, the service had to be the WORST I have ever seen. Nothing like seeing locals walking out because the service was horrible. If I could give places 0 or negative stars I would say -10 on service/beer choices/manager/lying to the customer 3x, but 5/5 for pizza taste. Maybe just order to go?"
56,"Overpriced and Terrible Service.  After ordering our drinks we never saw our server again. We managed only to get some food by waiving down passing servers who would all respond with the same ""Oh, I'm not your server but I'll let them know.""  When we managed to finally get a pizza the cheese was 70% burnt while the crust was still on the raw side.  Multiple bubbles in the dough had developed during cooking and pushed all of the toppings and cheese onto the remaining 30% of the pizza.  I was appalled they had the nerve to serve such an ugly inedible pizza.  Around this point the worst version of ""Norwegian Wood"" I have ever heard started to be piped through all the speakers courtesy of a hack cover band who seemingly had never played outside a garage before much less in front of people.  After 15 minutes of seriously considering just getting up and leaving another ""not our server"" server finally brought us our cheque.  50$ for a burnt pizza and build your own garlic bread? Yikes.... Did i mention the garlic bread comes un-toasted and with the garlic on the side?"
57,"I finally have some time to sit down and put some thought into writing this. My girlfriend and I have been coming here for quite some time now and usually have a grand time. Great outside patio with plenty of tables and a fireplace, mood lighting, the whole shebang. They also have a marvelous selection of beer.Our last experience however was not up to par. Walked in, and greeted by a very pleasant gentleman saying we could sit anywhere. We grabbed a table outside. The service was mediocre at best. Our server dipped in the middle of our meal. The busser or food runner was obviously not having a good day dropping our food on the table and not saying a thing, multiple times. So someone else finally came by to box everything up since our server was gone and the redemptive quality of our visit, her name was Kirby. So nice, very understanding, and explained that the beer we had was not flat but just extremely light, we hardy touched it because of its taste. She removed the beer from the tab. I guess just make sure you come in for dinner or whenever Kirby is working."
58,"Pretty Good Food, terrible serviceWe were a party of five and given quite a small table for eating a meal.  We chose to eat indoors as the live music prevented any conversation.Our wait person neither friendly nor in any way helpful.  The beers came quickly.  When the food arrived, there was no effort to help us find room for it on the table.  In our own effort to squeeze everything in, a glass filled with beer got broken.  I jumped up to ask for help as it was spilling over everything.  I approached two people, neither of whom came.  I started to grab things to mop it up and as I watched our wait person take an order before helping us, I approached yet another person.Eventually the mess was cleaned and another beer delivered.  That would have been okay, but we were then charged for the replacement beer.  Even if the breakage had been due to carelessness or intentional on our part, I have never been in an eating establishment that had the audacity to charge for a replacement drink.The experience was pretty miserable.  We won't be back."
59,"I can't say anything about the food nor the outside seating area.  I can say the waiter, Loren was rude and who didn't deserve 15%.  My friend was not feeling well, and wasn't going to order anything to eat.  So in case she wanted to leave early, I didn't order anything to eat as well.  We both ordered drinks, and Loren made a snarky comment about us just ordering one drink each when we said we weren't getting food.I was going to order a second drink, because the setting was nice and wanted to stay longer.  But just the thought of giving this guy a bigger tip was not in my interest."
60,"On a Sunday evening, seated inside, it was unbelievably LOUD.  Not sure why this establishment wants to crank up the bass filled club music to ear splitting levels.  One couple sat down and left within 2 minutes because of the volume.  The loud music then requires shouting, further increasing ambient noise.  Otherwise, my salad with garlic chicken was fine and the beer selection is of course, out of this world : )  Not willing to repeat this experience, but sitting outside can be very pleasant."
61,Homophobic waiter ignored us and then wondered around and didn't get our order.. Left and won't go back! Not Queer Friendly.
62,"Server was rude. Patio is open seating. However,  pregnant wives aren't allowed to occupy a table while their husband is getting a beer.  Luckily the waiters don't have name tags... Posted picture of horrible waiter."
63,"I came to celebrate my 21st bday here with my family and friends. I thought this place was the bomb.com because it always looks very crowded. Honestly, the food and drinks were great but the server we had was very rude.  There were about 10 of us and the server gave us plastic cups and i thought it was very rude. We came to eat and drink and he should at least give us regular cups. Not plastic cups. I was very disappointed and i felt like we weren't treated the same us other customers."
64,"They say never judge a book by its cover. Well this restaurant has a beautiful garden patio and it drew us in. We placed our orders and were anticipating the food. The first course of food took 45 minutes to come and it wasn't until another 20 minutes before the rest came. And the food was cold. But being cold was not the main problem. The pizza crust is like cardboard and the other dishes are pretty tasteless. My little daughter who is a bit of a foodie, for the first time ever, refused to eat the food. She has never in all these years refused food at restaurants or at home.My wife and I tried to force ourselves to eat the food as an example to her, but couldn't do it. We left with the food half eaten .. no 'to go' boxes this time. If you come, make sure it's only for drinks and the patio .. that's it."
65,Unimprssed with quality. Got their mediterrainian olives and it was SO hot that you could not even hold it in your hand 10 minutes past serving.
66,"Food tastes like its from Jupiter - if planet Jupiter were colonized by a species from a distant galaxy whose mission was to study earth, attempting to recreate its most terrible food, using ingredients found on their distant planet - which is coincidentally called Syscovium. You really couldn't have dreamed a worst tasting chicken wing. If someone put a gun to my head and instructed me to make chicken wings to taste rancid, I couldn't have done a better job than Jupiter at serving a stale, dry and contemporaneously slimey, dish-soap tasting chicken wing.Then there was the house made ranch dressing - a sour overspiced puddle of poorly conceived slop.I'm wondering if the folks who make the menu decisions here have ever tried the food...doubtful."
67,"Ate here the other day and ended being super sick after eating there. Chorro! Had the beet salad and pizza. Someone must have not properly washed their hands. And I'm paying for it, greatly paying for it. Sad face."
68,"Slightly unimpressed with the prices and portion sizes. This is based off of what I had today: a large house salad. I ordered the large house salad without the bleu cheese (the only gluten free and vegan option), and the portion was tiny. I got maybe 3 cups of spring mix with a dabble of red bell peppers and fewer olives. This was $8, and I could have just made a better salad for way cheaper. Was hoping for more."
69,"I had the Mercury pizza which is, as they told me, like Pizza Margherita.  The pizza was so dry, the cheese was put in such a sloppy way and in a big part it seemed as if they had run out the cheese they used for the most part and just put a different kind. The dough was tasteless and grease soaked. My friends got the Andromeda that is supposed to have 4different kinds of cheese but they were also disappointed because it did not suit their expectations. I kept half of the pizza for the next day but it was not edible. Really bad pizza."
70,"what a let down!Our waitress was either sleep walking or totally overwhelmed- not sure which.  I had to flag down multiple employees to help us.  ""Can we order now?  Can we get our check?  have you seen our waitress?""  The best part was that the employees all said they had no idea who our waitress was or where she went.  Great.The food was OK but there wasn't anything magical.  Prices were cheap- the ONLY positive.The final nail in the coffin-  the rest rooms.  I very much doubt the mens room had been cleaned or stocked in days!  No paper towels in two paper towel holders, toilet paper and seat covers strewn all over.  Over-flowing waste bins.  I just don't get the hype about this place?"
71,"Tried to place an order, but the phone sends me straight to voice mail after pressing #1, which oddly enough is the number for a manager on duty and for placing a pickup order"
72,"An institution on Shattuck that gets a lot of traffic and so they sacrifice quality of service and quality of food.Sunday mid-afternoon. Our server took forever to come over. Said he had a lot to do, so if we wanted something from the bar, we should get it ourselves. We asked for water. Someone else finally brought a pitcher (no ice) but no cups. It took another forever to get anyone's attention for those.Food is meh. Typical for a beer joint, I get it. Bottom line: there are better bar experiences in Berkeley."
73,"I'LL NEVER GO BACK!  This used to be one of my go tos in Berk. Ordered a Prarie. water taste?huh? Bartender tries to say thats the style. Bartender takes it back, now says bottom of barrel that's why its watery..  I surmise they're flushing lines. Should have asked for money back but really wanted to enjoy a brew. Ask for a Redwood Curtain, same thing. Return it. Order a Drake's Alpha Session. Had to ask for dif in cost back. Beer still wasn't 100 percent. Was ticked drank half and left. Sad cause I loved this place. Still can't believe he was trying to sell me water.  Pretty darn poor for a taproom thats been around for some years!."
74,"Good bar food. Great location. Love the outdoor fire pit. Good selection of bands. Horrible service. Don't forget your credit card here; potential huge security risk. It's a good venue for large groups. It's a nice place to come with friends, and usually I am too buzzed to notice their lackluster service. Their service is usually just meh even if it's just simple ordering and eating. They do what they have to and nothing more, which I usually don't mind, but the air of pretension is quite annoying. I lost my credit card at their restaurant. Called them and asked whether they found a lost credit card to have them reply unhelpfully, ""We find a lot of lost credit cards."" I asked them if they can verify whether my card was in their possession with my credit card number and they just told me bluntly I have to come down to the restaurant because no employee there has time to do that. And then they hung up. Seems like the guy on the phone was dying to hang up as soon as he can. I had my friend go down to check if I have indeed lost my credit card at their premise (I was already on a plane bound for elsewhere). I gave my friend my identification (my student ID) in case he did find my credit card and so he can grab it for me. It turns out they didn't even need to see any identification before they release someone's credit card to a stranger. In fact, I think they just gave my friend a stack of lost credit cards (to be fair to them, they did have a lot of lost credit cards) to sift though and he just took mine. A few weeks later, Chase informs me about a suspicious charge on that exact credit card. Someone took hold of my credit card information and tried to buy something online. Well, I don't think it's a scam by Jupiter's, but I suspect their lax security on other people's lost credit card enable someone else to grab a hold of my credit card information (and who knows? maybe other people's as well) and misuse that information. Other than this incident, as a patron for several years, I'm also pretty fed up with their ""I don't give a crap about you as a customer because we have lots of other customers, so just order, eat, drink, and get out of here"" attitude. They are lucky they have such a good location in a college urban town. However, good food is plentiful in Berkeley; better bars as well."
75,"RATS...LITERALLY.My friends and I stayed until closing Saturday night in the back patio seating area. We saw not one..but TWO FAT RATS scamper in between the dense seating area. I will be reporting this establishment to the City of Berkeley rodent infestation control. Thank goodness I didn't order food... NEVER order food here!!Also, I ordered a $28 bottle of Chilean wine and the bartender gave me some crap from Sonoma (Dry Creek Zinfandel). I don't know wines that well but I'm not drunk enough to be given a freaking different bottle. We drank it up anyway out of necessity for the grossly obtrusive international students that made way to our table within a minute of us sitting down."
76,Removed our shade mid meal and RACIST #NeverAgain.  The music was good though.
77,"Soo, I would have given this place 5 stars, since I love it so much. I love the service, I love the atmosphere, but honestly, what the eff happened to the good music? I am about ready to smash my head listening to the shitty jazz they are now playing. I'd be ok if it was good jazz, or live jazz, but honestly, it just puts me to sleep. I might as well go eat a sandwich in a hotel lobby. I want good music back. And then I will give back the 5 stars."
78,"This place doesn't work for me.  I don't like their beer.  Like, any of the beer.  Bleh.  And even though it's a local place, it feels like a franchise.  Big and boring.Staff seems to work hard, that's cool.  I just have no interest in what they're offering.I know plenty of people that like it though, I'm kind of on my own with my opinion about this joint.  Dissent, Disorder, Revolt!"
79,"Sat down, ordered 2 small pizzas, waited 50+ minutes for our food, gave up and left. No pizza should ever take that long. Not even the deepest of deep dish. The service did nothing to offset the ridiculous wait time."
80,"The food was alright, I wouldn't say the pizza is anything special. Burnt in a few places and the toppings were rather poorly spread out. The service, however, was absolutely horrendous. My table had to ask for our drinks 4 different times before they actually brought them out. They took their time to bring our water out even after us asking for it 4 times and gave it to us long after we had already finished the pizza. The worst part was that the server had the gall to actually say, ""sorry it took so long"" when they served the other tables their drinks first even though those people sat down a good 20-40 minutes after we did. We ended up having to wait nearly an hour just to get our water and I thought the nightmare would just end there. It took them another 30 minutes just to bring the check and another 30 minutes to actually return the change to us. We had specifically asked for change when we gave the check but the waiter disappeared after taking our check. I had to get up and find the manager to find out where our money went. I have to give props to the manager as he did try his best to help us out, but even he didn't know where the money went and had to just pull cash out of the register and told the cashier they'll just fix the problem later. The worst part about this whole experience? Jupiter wasn't even close to being crowded as there were plenty of waiters about and roughly half the tables empty."
81,"Sorry, Jupiter. I came in with high expectations, but I just wasn't floored. Pros:- large outdoor seating area, cute christmas lights strung up everywhere makes it feel ultra cozy. - beer selection, they had two rivers pomegranate cider on tap! annnnd that's about it.  We ordered a large half & half of the Xanthia and Galileo and a small 9"" of their Odysseus. The only one that I actually liked was their Xanthia- the rosemary and the garlic really brings the flavor to this pizza. However, the Galileo and Odysseus were really lacking in flavor and the toppings weren't enough so it just felt like I was eating glorified bread. MEH."
82,REAL TALK. I have gone here a couple of times in the evenings. On each occasion I left with a mixed experience. The food is pretty good. The beer selection is awesome. The problem comes with the crowd. It's hard to hear anything with all the people packed in there and made harder when they are blasting whatever CD they wanted to put in that day. I personally found the sound level unbearable. People are always walking around and coming in and out. The servers always seem to be battling to keep up and the food comes out slow. It was all very chaotic and for the sit-down eating experience it feels overwhelming. The inside ambience is... Dark. Dark room. Dim lights. Tiny candles lighting your table. The outside seating is nice though. It's an open little garden and there sometimes is live music. Unfortunately.... I have never been able to enjoy that as they always seem to be filled up and people often end up taking hours to leave thier spots.While this place has it's perks I generally avoid it. For me it wasn't worth the money for the experience. Dealing with the crowd and waiting isn't something I want to do unless it is truly worth it. If this place ever decided between being a dive bar or sit down pizza place I would consider re-evaluating it. For now I am left feeling like I should just avoid it.
83,"What does it take to get a comped beer at Jupiter? Apparently not a homeless guy wondering in while your eating dinner, sitting down at your table, and washing his syringe in a glass of water."
84,"If you are looking for a late night gathering, skip this place. Had a going away celebration for an amazing coworker of ours last night. Very chill crowd.. All in the restaurant business, 2 managers and about 12 employees. After last call, the Asian ""Manager"" child, because that is exactly how he was acting, yelled ""Maybe if I turn off the f***ing lights, people will get the point"".  As a restaurant manager, I was floored!! Quickly I checked him saying, ""that was rude as hell! If u want us to leave then say it politely"".  Well, this must have given him his one opportunity to puff his mini chest because he starts to argue with me in an attempt at what was sarcastic hospitality. Really? You, a supposed Adult Male, gets all butt hurt and transforms into an adolescent girl, by arguing with a calm, non threatening woman. I'm sure it finally got his testosterone flowing. Little did he know, he was simply entertaining all the remaining patrons (our remaining 5 guests, a separate party of 3 fellas, and another 2 top of ladies) how unprofessional, ignorant, and disrespectful he attempted to be. NEVER would I be so SaSSy to my guests...  Remember they pay your salary.  It's unfortunate how blatantly disrespectful and how quickly he verbally attacked me... Words don't hurt but yelps do!  So word of advice to you folks looking for a good night out, skip this place and find somewhere else where the sissy ass manager won't bitch you out. Oh! And how rude is it to bash our establishment and attempt to praise yours? Uh, sorry Diva... Guests will patronize where they are respected. I feel sorry for your employees. If this is their FINE example of leadership, I suggest they run for the hills! The ""Manager"" should retreat to some job in utter solitude because his, I mean HER interpersonal skills, leadership, respect and tactic skills are subpar. I'm sure the owner doesn't know this behavior is displayed during his absence. I'm sure he would agree that the way that situation was handled was 100% unacceptable.  Damn, too bad you can't give 5 stars for being the most bitchy of the evening because Asian manager would have gotten it. On another note, all other staff were very pleasant. Two even brought two of us free beers! Food.. Meh!"
85,"I have eaten at Jupiter before but this time was not acceptable food wise.  I realize that  food is not the specialty, I did not go there for beer. I accompanied two beer drinkers or I would not have gone in the first place.I did order the veggie cheese and gluten free crust pizza so in essence I asked for it,  but I have had vegan cheese, rice crust pizza before and they were at least edible.The salad was really the worst, the house salad.  The dressing was the consistency of syrup and sat in one big glob in the middle of the lettuce.  I took several bites and put it aside.   The greens stuck together with no lightness that one gets from a regular salad. If I had not gone with others I would have sent the salad back and asked that it be removed from the bill.  In retrospect I should have.Next time I will insist to my brew favoring companions that I will go where the beer is but not to Jupiter.."
86,"Not a fan. I've only been once, but I don't think I'll be going back. I got the ""Mercury"" - defined on their menu as their margherita, and their Pomegranate Cider. The pizza was very bland - it was lacking any kind of sauce, so it was very dry. I asked for a side of marinara, something/anything to dip it in. It was provided, but it does cost an additional $1.50. Any dipping sauce does actually. The pomegranate cider tasted very watery, so I'm not sure what went into that. I also believe it to be a bit overpriced - mine was $16 for a 13 inch. Albeit, I did have leftovers. My boyfriend Eutropia - a very meaty pizza, and he said it was really good. As petty as it sounds...it had sauce so I bet it was good!I wouldn't really recommend this place if you like a margherita pizza as much as I do, but anything else probably tastes pretty good!"
87,"We went there waited for our table not a long wait 20 minutes when we walked up to the lady at the counter after calling our name was rude said wait ""out side"" she had just called us to tell us our table was ready & then she said go back out & wait??? Finally we got our table the waiter right away walked up & didn't even ask us for our drink order, instead straight out said what do you want to eat. Never mind asking if we waned water we said we wanted drinks, he proceeds to say you have to eat you can't get drinks & started slamming the menu on the table. Then he said if you don't eat you have to leave. We left, & my friend really wanted a beer so we found some lonely table in the back corner & was helped by another waiter whom took decided to spiky the bill they way he wanted it without even asking, then when he brought the portion for the credit card  he didn't not bring the receipt to sign he had to go back & get that then charge the card which this whole process took 20 minutes just to pay!!! SERVICE IS HORRIBLE HERE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!"
88,"The food here was awesome! I had a pizza with potatoes and seasons and great cheese.  I absolutely loved it!  This place would have gotten 4-5 stars had our waiter not been the worst waiter I may ever have had.  I met up with some friends here and we sat around, ate, talked for quite a while, about 2 hours.  After he took our orders he never came back again, we never got offered refills on drinks, he never asked how our meal us.  It appears we were inconveniencing him by existing.  When it came time to pay for dinner, the check was split, some in cash, some in cards.  Instead of thinking about how it would all work, or hell, asking, he used all the cash and then put the remainder on the cards, not splitting it evenly.  He only figured this out 10 minutes later when he came back asking us for a tip.  Seriously?! He came back and asked us to give him a tip.  We got one, but it was very low.  And I forget what he did but some was actually subtracted from his low tip to begin with cause he insulted us again.  Will never go back."
89,"Was in the area catching up with a friend in May and got hungry. Didn't have time to stay & eat so I placed an order to-go. It's a little weird because you have to go up to the bar-looking area in order to place an order for take-out. Felt so awkward standing there waiting for my order as dishes & drinks were going out to tables around me. They have outdoor seating which would be nice to chill with some friends.My order:9"" Cassiopeia ($9.95) Roasted chicken breast, sweet onions, fresh cilantro, barbeque sauce, mozzarella, marinara baked in a brick ovenGarlic Chicken wings ($7.95) Marinated in garlic and soy sauce, and baked in a brick oven. Served with house-made ranch dressing with cilantro and green onion.None of the food wow-ed me. Interesting combination of flavors for the pizza, but wouldn't order it again. The wings were tender and juicy, but the seasoning wasn't something I'd go back for either."
90,"A large part of the seating is outside so when it's raining, inside obviously gets busier. My friends and I (4 of us total- nothing crazy) put our name down and were told there would be a twenty minute wait. After 25 minutes of standing in the cold breezeway, we asked how much longer and were told 10 more minutes. After 15 more minutes (double the original wait time), we left. Never actually got the text saying our table was ready. Their food and drink selection is hardly worth even a 20 minute wait."
91,"I'm a little bummed that we had such bad luck. Pizza had no toppings and was half the size of others we saw. Bad luck I guess. The tables are dirty, I think they could use a busser with an actual clean rag...  The beer was pretty good."
92,"Jupiter was recommended to me as a fun place with friendly service and good food. When I waked through the outdoor seating area and inside the bar I was ready for a good experience.  Looks can be deceiving.  I sat at the bar and the bartender barely acknowledged me.  He was semi-rude and the food was awful.  The service was equally bad.  I left without finishing my food because it was not worth the calories.  And, I only ordered a chicken salad.  How can you mess up a chicken salad?  Oh, by using fake meat and charging as if it was something special.  I did not enjoy my experience at Jupiter."
93,"Ok, this place is totally hit or miss. My first time here I was so happy with everything from the beer, pizza, and the service. However, my second time here was quite disappointing. We were a large group on a Friday night and this place gets PACKED...like as in OVERWHELMING PACKED and LOUD to the point where you're yelling at the people next to you just trying to have a conversation. I guess my disappointment comes down to the pizza. My pizza was undercooked and it was clearly rushed from the way the toppings were just carelessly thrown on to the dough. The annoying thing was that some of the other pizzas my friends ordered looked well prepared and cooked perfectly while mine just looked...sad. lol Basically, inconsistency at a restaurant is enough to give me trust issues so good luck if you're coming here because I most likely won't come back. My biggest recommendation is to go on a night that doesn't look too busy- maybe their kitchen staff will handle your food with more love and care. GOOD LUCK!"
94,"In town visiting for the Northwestern - Cal college football season opener, and after the exciting late night game, we couldn't find a place to celebrate.  Although Jupiter was still open, they were really understaffed, as if they were completely taken by surprise (don't they have football season every year?)  It was hot and crowded, sticky and dirty, the staff was indifferent, sluggish, and unfriendly.  Couldn't get to the bar for a drink, we finally ordered a round and then it was time to close."
95,"Went on a Friday. The first time I came to Jupiter I was with someone. We went around 5 pm and it was crowded. The host was kind, telling us we could be served right away if we grabbed a seat outside (which we couldn't since it was packed), otherwise we would have to wait AT LEAST 30-45 minutes to be seated indoors, even though he said that the upstairs' seating area was opening in 10 minutes. We decided to wait since we were craving pizza and this place apparently has the best reviews in downtown Berkeley.1. I hate waiting. Waiting and hunger is NOT a good mix. We were waiting by the entrance and saw a few tables opened but they didn't seat us until we asked (45 minutes in). Keep in mind that we didn't ask at first because they said they would text us once a seat was available. They didn't. 2. The service was pretty decent. Served us drinks and food right away. I ordered the Galileo with chicken, which was good, but the crust was really tough to eat. Also, there was BARELY any chicken. I had to scan the pizza to find the darn bird. 3. We waited nearly 25 minutes to get our check, and we had to ASK. Now I don't know if that's standard there in Jupiter, but from what I'm used to--as soon as a waiter sees your dishes have been picked up, give 'em a check. Nope, didn't happen. We were cutting it pretty close to see a movie and decided we didn't want to rush, so we postponed it for another day. Darn it. Overall, the pizza is pretty good. Solid flavor, not too salty, and I loved the vegetables on the Galileo, however, don't bother asking for extra toppings because it's just a waste of money and you'll barely notice the difference. The waiting was not really worth it. My advice: If you're with good people and you don't mind waiting, be a guest at Jupiter's; it'll give you more time to spend with them. Make sure you come in not that hungry either, because then you'll be STARVING when you get your food. I'm not coming back here."
96,"We've gone here a couple of times. Food and beers have decent. When looking for some late night eats tonight, Jupiter was the first to come to mind. We walk in and are told to seat ourselves. It's so packed that it takes about 10 minutes of walking around to find a seat. After about another 10 minutes of looking at the menu, our server finally comes by and tells us the kitchen is closed. She asks if anyone had told us. Well, she saw us looking through the FOOD menu. So, it was apparent no one had. Nowhere on Yelp or the NoWait app does it state they stop serving food at a certain time. And it certainly wasn't posted anywhere in the restaurant. Left a bad taste in our mouth. Definitely won't be the first to come to mind next time."
97,"Came here with a group of friends for dinner on a Sunday night. It was hard trying to flag down/recognize someone who worked there too. Nobody came to greet/help us if we didn't scout out and hunt someone down. I also had made reservations a couple weeks ago, but was told at the front that reservations were ""not allowed to be made for Sundays"". I had to explain to her that I had already confirmed it with someone before, and there was some confusion there as she went to talk to someone about it only after I insisted i made reservations. There should have been a policy for all workers to follow so that doesn't confuse the customers. The service was pretty terrible. Our waters were always empty, it took forever for us to try to flag down some service. Our water were  never filled, and our food took about 80 minutes to come out when we were told it would take about 40 minutes. The food that came out should have been exceptional, but the pizza was very salty, not very hot, and a little burnt. I felt very unsatisfied. I expected higher quality as the pizzas were also very expensive. They added 20% gratuity which was ridiculous because the service was terrible. I would gladly give it if the service was great, but it was pretty bad. They should have given us something on the house given that we waited an hour and a half for 3 pizzas. I do not see myself coming back here."
98,It pains me to give Jupiter a one star because I used to love this place but this past weekend a saw a humungous rat running around the outside area.  I understand that the area may be bringing the rats in and not the actual restaurant kitchen but this is a serious health problem that needs to be addressed.This happened smack-dab right in the middle of dinner.
99,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. We had to flag down a passing waitress to inquire about our reservation when we first arrived, since you're supposed to seat yourself. Food: 3/5We ordered 2 spinach artichoke dips to share for appetizers. They were good and came out fairly fast. We also ordered 3 13"" pizzas, the Circe, IO, and Xanthia. The pizzas weren't bad, but were very salty. They were also very inconsistent; toppings and cheese seemed to be piled on haphazardly, with inconsistent crust width all around, with burnt cheese on one side and large swathes of chewy crust on another. At ~$16 per pizza, I would definitely expect a higher quality level. Service: 1/5Service started out ok at first, with our waitress coming by to give us waters and take our orders fairly fast. She informed us that pizzas would take ~30 mins due to the restaurant being busy. Unfortunately, we ended up waiting for over an hour for our food, with no one coming by to update us. Our pizzas miraculously arrived 5 minutes after we finally complained about the long wait (although without any apology or offer of compensation). We also had to repeatedly ask for water refills. Since our group was large a 20% gratuity was automatically added - we weren't pleased at all with this, since a service charge should generally mean that a good level of service is provided (it wasn't). We were also told that they would not split bills, and our waitress made a big deal out of the bill being ""itemized"" (seems like a standard feature, and it didn't really help in splitting the bill evenly either). Ambience: 4/5The place is fairly loud but intimate, with wooden furniture, dim but adequate lighting, and large artwork/posters on the walls. The loud noise level can make it hard to hear everyone at the table, especially if you have a large group. There's also an outdoor patio which is nice.In conclusion, I'm not really sure whether I want to return. Jupiter is by no means a cheap place to eat, and at these prices the level of service and food quality leave quite a bit to be desired."
100,"The bartender, Adam, was amazing. Some of the others however, were atrocious. My friend was assaulted by a group of people. Adam made sure the guy who started the altercation was kicked out the bar. Later on, the same guy came back into the bar. That is when I told two of the workers, a younger man and woman to please tell the guy to leave. Instead, they argued with me about how my friend ""shouldn't have been talking shit"". When I told them that the man could be charged for commiting a crime by assaulting my friend and that he should be arrested, they laughed. I instructed them to handle the situation or call the police and that's when they laughed at me again. All the while, his group of friends where waiting outside the door for us to leave. We waited in the bar until closing because we didn't want to get into an altercation while the workers refused to handle the situation appropriatly. When we finally had to leave, a physical altercation took place where the people who originally started the fight, once again, decided it was a good idea to hit my friend as he was walking out. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because of the two incompetent workers. It's actually a pretty awesome establishment and Adam was a true gentleman. Just make sure you fire the idiots and hire some workers with common sense. Oh yeah, to put the icing on the cake, one of the workers actually threatened to fight one of my friends. Get it together Jupiter. How about we keep Champaign classy, yeah?"
101,"The food at Jupiter feels a little overpriced, and the service is somewhat spotty. The patio also has some particularly cold spots that can make an evening slightly less than enjoyable (try and avoid the back left area). That being said, it's a nice venue, and the drinks are reasonable.Specifics: I've been here a couple times with friends, and with a birthday party. 2 out of those 3 times, the restaurant was very crowded, and thus the waits on the pizzas were very long. The bar service is fine, however, and though the pizzas seemed a bit small for the price, they were tasty. If you're ready for a leisurely evening of drinking and munching, I'd be fine with Jupiter, but if you're more hungry and antsy for eats, you might check out one of the restaurants on Center St."
102,"Food is pretty good. The house beers are bland and strangely dry. Yeesh, and they give you a huge glass, which takes forever to finish because of the aforementioned blandness. And no 'happy hour' sucksAlso the ************ is krej; an insulting krej. Nowwwww is the day to gobbeklyskj cl"
103,"Great pizza, delicious beer, AWFUL service! While I've enjoyed everything I've ordered here, the rudeness of the staff thoroughly ruined my dining experience on two occasions. That being said,  I may be back simply because I dig the outdoor patio (especially at night-- beautiful!) and the grub is bueno... Try it out, but spare yourself and get it to-go!"
104,"The place charges for refills of soda--unacceptable by itself. But what made it worse is that they refilled my glass twice upon request, before letting me know that refills aren't free.Fountain soda is cheap, and there's no reason not to offer free refills, especially when you're part of a large group which also ordered alcohol and food."
105,"So....I like beer and pizza as much as the next person. But, I may decide to venture elsewhere when the mood strikes again. Went there on a Friday night and it was SO CROWDED, but we got seated right away. We tried 4 different beers, the Triton pizza, and the wings. Whatever you decide to do on your food adventure...DON'T GET THE WINGS. The pizza was ok, but nothing you can't live without. The beer, the darker it was the tastier it was. The lighter brews, like the kolsch style one, tasted like beer flavored water. But the stout was pretty decent. Overall, I am running to have this again, but it may be worth it during a happy hour."
106,"So many great things about Jupiter have been overshadowed recently by their expansion of the ""seat yourself"" policy.  Previously it applied to the outdoor seating area, but if that was looking like an ordeal, you could just put your name in for a table with the hostess.  Yesterday some friends and I arrived to find the hostess station had a sign reading ""please seat yourselves"". The result is a busy restaurant with groups of people randomly hovering throughout the place staking out tables that look like they'll be vacated soon.  Not only is this an unpleasant dining experience, but the already slow and inattentive servers can't even get around.  This is absolutely unacceptable and has to stop.  I don't know if this is all the time or just on certain days, but if I walk up and see the sign again I'm just leaving."
107,"Pizza: edible.  Not much else to say about it.  Have been here twice, never impressed.Beer: fair.  Selection is ok, not special.  Atmosphere: bar/dive, too loud at times.  Decent place to go out/try once or twice, never understood why many people seem to like it so much."
108,"I've been dragged here a few times, and I've never enjoyed myself.  Always crowded, obnoxious crowd, usually bitchy servers.  Overpriced beer, decent pizza.  Good place if you're looking for somewhere generic to meet with an old acquaintance who you don't actually care about catching up with."
109,"Wow. What can I say. I was recommended this place by my boss because she loves this place. I was excited because she has great taste in places. Well I didn't even get to eat the dang food! So we got the ""seat ourselves"" and so we found a seat quick. The waiter gave us our menus. Then gave us  warm water on a hot day! (that was my first negative also considering other tables were getting ice water) Then he finally came to get our order. We knew it was busy so we figured a 30 min wait for pizza. 20 mins go by, ok we get it, it's a busy night. 30 mins go by ok the waiter will come tell us theres a longer than normal wait, NO! He didn't. 45 mins waiting on just two small pizzas and I had to ask him where our pizzas were. He went to check and never came to tell us. He went to other tables to give them service and 8 mins later he said ""kitchen says you're next so it'll be a min"" probably 5-7 mins later still nothing. Let's just say they lost business and we never ate. Screw this place."
110,"Tastes better than your average pizza joint. The service was not disappointing, they were very cheerful. I'd probably wouldnt go here again."
111,Horrible experience....So a friend and I go there for the first time because we heard so much great things about the place..it was a Monday night and the place wasn't packed except for the outside patio....first of all....as we walked in...no one greeted us and there was a few servers just hanging around chatting and ignoring us....after 5 minutes a girl tells us we can sit anywhere...uh ok....so we walked outside because it seemed cozy and nice....most of the tables were occupied except for these random chairs on a platform....which we thought were ok to sit on....so we sat and waited....3 servers walked by us and didn't even bother to ask us anything or even nice enough to tell us that this section or seats isn't a place to sit.....I knew there was something wrong because we were ignored and when I got up to grab a menu...I passed a waitress who looked at me like....what am I doing grabbing a menu? well.....I wouldn't have if you would help me instead of helping everyone around us......mostly jocks and college kids.....who wants to help two random guys looking for dinner....so.....I get up and and ask this one girl who was standing doing nothing....hey can we get service...we are sitting over there....I pointed to her where we were at and she goes...oh that's not a service area.....how the F should we know that......There's no fucking sign.......and she was not polite and didn't even care....so my friend and I got up and went inside....confused and ignored...we just grabbed the nearest table on our own.......so IS THIS A FREE FOR ALL PLACE OR are we gonna get service...and again...after the 20 minute outside session we are still waiting...servers passing us by...even helping the table next to us.....not even looking at my hand signals...why are we still at this place...because we were stuck and wanted to eat so bad....my friend decided to get up and order a beer at the bar.....so I got up too and grabbed a beer....we sat and drink and looked at the menu and still no one came.....so we said F it and slammed out beers and left......what kind of place tells you to sit down TO IGNORE YOU.......5 servers...walking by us...I could tell you the names of all of them but its worthless.....just like the place and the people who run it....even the bartender was a jerk.....NEVER GO TO THIS CRAP....you have to serve yourself......what kind of shit is that.......
112,"Man, oh man. I really hate writing bad reviews. I really do. I don't enjoy it, but if my experience is so bad, I have to vent it out. Jupiter sadly was a bad experience, especially for my first time there. SMH.This review is referring to their bar, after 11pm menu. It was a Saturday night, and I was really pumped to go to Jupiter. I've been hearing so many great reviews, positive experiences, and awesome beer that this place has to offer from many students, yelpers, and friends. Crazy thing is that I've never been to this spot while I was attending Cal. So we walked in and damn, this place is dope. Great environment, spacious space, and they had an upstairs. The tables were awesome for groups of folks because they were circular and spread out. The beer was great. I ordered the Red Spot Ale? (Can't really remember). Bottom line- they had awesome offerings.What brings this all down is the service. Holy crap, how long does it take to get a waiter? Not only did we have to hunt for a waiter, but he really sucked. He was slow, unfriendly, and DID NOT give a hoot about taking care of us. Never checked up on us, and was way too busy flirting with girls near the bar area. Seriously? I get that it's a Saturday night and you want to bring your A game on but maybe you should worry about your tip so you can treat them out afterwards. Worst experience ever. Not only did he give us the worst service ever, but he closed our tab without telling us. -_- How obvious are you in trying to kick us out? He would have made a lot of business with a group of big time drinkers along with a good tip."
113,"This place if pretty chill. I haven't eaten here so it's just another bar in my eyes.I really just like the fire-pit on the back patio when it's not too crowded. It's what makes this place unique from other spots on Shattuck. Otherwise, I've had better."
114,"Jupiter just isn't good enough to justify all of the flaws... Not that we all won't keep coming back due to the location and the patio - there just isn't anywhere else like it in Berkeley, and that's exactly the reason why I doubt it will ever improve.Too crowded, filthy bathrooms, poor service, and mediocre food. That said, the pizza is alright and they have a very good selection of beers. Just don't order anything that isn't pizza or beer, because the rest of the menu is terrible.That said, if you're looking for a brunch beer on a sunny day, and you don't have to use the bathroom, it's not a bad spot."
115,"I went to this place because of the great reviews. Well, I was really disappointed :(. First of all, I ordered a 16"" pizza. When I got it, the actual pizza was only half way filled with toping;the other half was all crust. This didn't look right, so I asked to get a pizza where I actually get to have more toping. After half an hour they brought me a pizza which looked exactly the same. I did not enjoy it much. In addition, the beer was not that good, and so was the pomegranate cider. To top things off,  the waiter was rude and slow. I would not go to this place again."
116,still so loud inside as to make a it hard to hear the person sitting on the 90 degree side of the table from you. Also this time service was super slow... 45 minutes from when we sat down our food came...  and not especially filling at thatand apparently the restrooms are accessed by going outdoors...?
117,"So the beer was good. Some of the service was okay, but two main complaints:1 - Forgot our order, they did comp our appetizer, but waiting for 50 mins kinda sucked.2 - Strange doorman - it was like 8:45 and they were checking ID? Right after the dude left...so...what's the point of that? (more importantly was he actually a doorman/bouncer? I could have probably taken him)."
118,"This place has a fantastic outdoor patio, with great ambiance. However, someone in the kitchen has a thing for salt. I had the Mediterranean salad and added salmon. It was drowning in dressing which was so salty, I had to stop eating it halfway through. I dug through the salad to find pieces of lettuce with no dressing. My lips were puckered and I went through two glasses of water. I had a piece of a friends pizza to try and use the bread to cut down on the saltiness, but the tomatoes on the pizza were visibly coated in salt as well. The food had great potential, but salt is to enhance flavor, not take over. I didn't drink any beer so I can't comment on their brewing."
119,"Came here once, almost positive I won't be going back. I don't like their ciders, they all taste flat. I didn't like my pizza. It was weird. The crust was salty and very unpleasant. (I think I got the Magerita)The best thing about this place is the decor, it's really pretty and would be a great place to hang out if I enjoyed the food."
120,"Ten minutes after the hostess seated us, we finally flagged someone down to serve us.  Apparently she was going off shift, but took our order anyway.  During the wait, we watched the tables on either side of us both get seated, get served, and finish their meals.  44 minutes later, our food arrived.  I'd ordered the ""Triton"" pizza without onions... it came slathered with onions.  Apologies and excuses were made... apparently something about a miscommunication on the change of shift.  Regarding that, the only time we saw our ""new"" waitress was when she came to present the check.  My wife's beet salad was OK.  My pizza tasted bland and soggy.  Next time, for beer and pizza, we'll just head to LaneSplitter."
121,"Jupiter, you are cool, but you are crowded and understaffed. And you don't offer pizza by the slice OR free refills. What is this, SF? No, it's Berkeley and you're supposed to be better than that, gourmet ghetto and all. And what's with the self-seating during dinner time? I saw two waiter/hosts for the whole damn place - avid its a big place. Offer slices. Get a few more waiters. Give a damn about your customers."
122,"Aweful service (we are in the biz... at least fake it,crack a smile!) half the beers on the board not available.our  Server(Jr.) chatting with friends insted of getting my salad dressing I asked for 10 min ago? We were mad. I had to EXCUSE me...and ask for a refill of soda to be told we don't give refills. How about a I'm so sorry for making you wait, this one is on me. ( crappy service without simple compensation= pathetic restaurant) nope. not even a im sorry.   Then only to listen to another server, chatting right next to me, with same group of friends to be bitching about the owner was in and did not tip her. Owner ordered at the bar. He did pay for all her school field trips for the last 3 years, she's been there for ten years...oh wait why do I know or care... I don't. Its called watch your mouth...where is your manager? its clearly a free for all shit show. I wanted service not drama. We will never be back and have a lot of friends who won't be back either.P.s. the meat pie thing looked and tasted aweful. Those are mashed potatoes? Wow talk about aweful. Place is gross!!"
123,"I ended up here twice in two days because it is across the street from our office in the Brower Center.  It is actually a really huge place with lots of great outdoor seating for when the weather is nice.  The House beer list was long but didn't have any of the Belgian varieties that I tend to prefer.  I tried the wheat, the dry stout and the Red Amber which was much hoppier than I expected.  They were all fine choices.  I also tried a number of different pizza's and salad.  The pizza was much closer to what I like than Sliver was, though the price point was much higher too.  We ended up with 6 pizzas and 3 or 4 salads for 12 people and it was too much food for us.  The pizza was decent enough that I'd come back again.  The real complaint though was the music.  It was incredibly loud and also just kind of boring, smooth jazz inspired.  It was too loud to talk over but really boring to listen to.  Definitely a night killer."
124,"Dropped 2 stars. Not for the quality of the food (which btw is still delicious) but for the service we received: definitely does not deserve 4-stars. Jupiter's has some pretty rude waitresses. My friends and I came on a slightly sprinkling day and the only space they had at the time (dinner) was outside in the patio. We didn't mind considering that the patio was covered. But the lady was very rude when she took our order. She basically barked at us saying that she didn't want to come outside here often because it's raining and for us to just order all at once. Sure, I get that it's raining. But you can go complain to your coworkers... not the people who will be giving you tip & are coming to the restaurant you're working in for some bomb pizza. Luckily, it started raining harder and we were seated inside where another waiter served us. Seriously such a downpour (literally) on our dinner party."
125,"One of the mysteries of my decades long quest to find pizza in the Bay Area as good as New York pizza is that there seems to be some kind of inverse relationship between quality of the site and the quality of the food. Convenient, spacious, pleasant restaurants have horrible pizza; where there is good pizza, it is often from some kind of nearly inaccessible tiny place where one is lucky to have any seating at all, much less good seating. Logically, the most popular places should have the best food and the best locations, it seems to me, but that just doesn't seem to be the case.Jupiter certainly exemplifies that rule. It has great ambience, one of the best in Berkeley if you can sit in the courtyard. Being surrounded by plants, people; nice beer; friendly service; it's just a homey, charming place to sit and chat. Even the interior has a kind of warmth to it, like being in a European pub.Unfortunately the food - which is what I am reviewing here - does not approach the quality of the space. I had most recently what was billed as a kind of margherita pizza, they call it a ""Mercury"". There was just a little bit of basil in it, crumpled on, flavorless (margherita should have plenty of fresh basil, usually whole leaves); the crust was soggy and undercooked; no taste of olive oil or garlic; the mozzarella was some kind of really low-end, commodity mozzarella; even the tomatoes were kind of uninspired, kind of generic, undercooked tomatoes. The whole dish was nearly flavorless, and soggy, like it was made by someone who had never had good pizza following recipe instructions from the cheapest possible ingredients. Accompanying was garlic bread with some kind of low-grade cheese on it, again flavorless and bland. This is a fine place to have beer with friends, enjoy pizza and a great venue. But the food, not so much."
126,"My roommate graduated and had a dinner party at her place in Hercules. To continue the celebration, she suggested barhopping in Berkeley. After searching on Yelp, she found Jupiter and I was sold on it considering the high rating and because they served my beloved Albarino =).When we got there, we immediately could tell it was more of a local's bar, but my roommates being the beer lovers they are were still excited to go. I felt like a child walking in since the crowd appeared much older. However, this is not what merited Jupiter my one star review.I went to the bar to order my drink and chatted up a cool guy from Finland, which was the only good thing about this place. The both of us kept talking until we realized...why have none of the bartenders asked us what we wanted? We were clearly standing, wallets in hand and waiting to order. The two bartenders kept looking at us and then started drinking beer with their co-workers and other familiar faces they knew.I was beyond irritated and about to walk away until finally Joe came and said ""oh you 2 look like you have been waiting patiently!"" YEAH BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN, EVEN THOUGH, YOU WERE NOT SERVING ANYONE OR TAKING ANYONE'S ORDERS! He took our orders, but there was no redemption. I waited 20 minutes for a glass of wine? Are you serious? I definitely would not come back and I am puzzled by the high rating."
127,"Bad service. I used to like their food and beer, bust last night me and friend went there around 12. The servers never come and let us wait for 40 minutes and tell us "" oh, our kitchen close at 12:30."" which we were there 30 minutes before the kitchen close. It pissed me off. And I don't appreciate their attitudes. If they really want to get off on time. They should get a job in a busy restaurant then."
128,"Doesn't deserve to be cited by vegan restaurant goers! Terrible food, terrible service."
129,"The outside has a great atmosphere if you don't mind a large crowd.  The main reason why this place is receiving one star frome is the horrible service. First of all the waitress didn't come to our table until after 15 minutes of us sitting; from being a server myself I tried to be understanding as it was an extremely busy Sunday afternoon. We started with ordering 3 of the Red Spot Ale. After 10 minutes of waiting for the beer we reminded the waitress then she bought them over. Once I was able to enjoy the beer, it was delicious, reminded me of an Irish stout.  We had the Eutropia pizza which was nothing great, wasn't very flavorful (coming from Brooklyn I have high expectations of pizza). The other people in my group wanted to order another pizza so we put in an order for another Eutropia and another round of the ale. After 15 minutes we still hadn't received the ale and found our waitress. She then informed us the ale had ran out, but for whatever reason decided to not give us the opportunity to order something else. After about 35 minutes of waiting for the pizza we assumed she probably forgot to put the order in and we asked for the check. She told us the pizza was almost done and we requested to just have it to go at that point. Usually I don't like to trash places and this place was so hyped up to me by friends but the service was unacceptable and the food wasn't worth the negligence we received. Needless to say I have no desire on returning."
130,"Tried to eat here for dinner this evening and was greatly disappointed. It was so crowded and noisy both inside and out on the patio. You have to shout to hear each other speak. I approached the host to put my name down for a table and was ignored. Before that, a party of 5 cut right in front of me to talk to the host. Outside seating is first come first serve. This was a nightmare. You literally have to hover over people's tables to wait for them to leave and take their seats. Every time I tried to get a table, someone else would swoop in before me. You have to be fast and tenacious. I left with my friend and ate at Burger Meister which was so much better. This place was just not my cup of tea."
131,"I used to be fan of this place until last night! If you are European avoid this place like the plague. First this place has become unpleasant between the people attending and the customer service. Wait time on Friday is 30-40mm when most people try get tables in a gorilla type of effort on the outside, everybody for itself on the outside. Longing on people that are about to leave. Then, when we finally got a table the service is slow and inattentive. The waiter was unsympathetic except for his TIP. We ordered large pizza and 2 drinks. It was obvious that the server wanted us out to get the TIPs rolling after we paid, it told us THAT PEOPLE WERE IN LINE for a table, basically we had to leave because his time to Tips were not accomplish and basically that's the way it is in America! After with gave him the tip of course! I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED at a place in my life. If you are Europeans PLEASE avoid this place like the PLAGUE. It finally happened a waiter tell us to leave because they needed to turn around this table for his TIP/Time ratio, UNBELIEVABLE!"
132,"Vibe/Ambiance - 4 starsFood - 2.5 starsService - 0-1 StarsOur server was training someone and we were a party of seven so she automatically got gratuity. That meant we automatically got terrible service. We ordered our food then waited 40 minutes before anything came out. We sat with empty waters and empty beers after about 10 minutes. She never stopped by to say, ""Hey the kitchen is slammed it will be a bit"" or ""Would you like another beer since I've been ignoring you for 20 minutes and your beer is now empty?"" When the food came out they brought our starters and our entrees at the same time. Yay! I love when restaurants do this, said no customer ever.We were then ignored again until a bill was dropped after we sat with empty plates for another 15 minutes after dinner.This place is usually busy and i will assume this was an isolated, yet poor experience. Buyer beware with large groups I guess. No reason for me to go back."
133,"We had a party of 6 and we came here for lunch around 1pm on a Saturday. It was THE WORST service we've experienced in quite a while. The waiter we had was equivalent to a chicken with its head cut off. He literally threw down the menus. The whole lunch service was SUPER SLOW. Our food arrived cold. It was bad. Even though we got one pizza on the house because it was the last dish to come after the rest of the party. We will never return. And the worst part is, I'm not even sure if the waiter was aware of what was happening. Oh wells, there's plenty of other places to grab a slice of pizza."
134,"Great wait staff. Pizza is right out of the supermarket freezer. Salad was totally underwhelming, no thought, no style, just a bunch of romaine chopped up and put on a plate."
135,"Came in with a group for lunch and the patio was full so we took the round table closet to the patio.  The restaurant in general looked dirty, but hearing good things about it, it seemed worth it to try.  Most of us ordered beers which were all very good and delivered fairly quickly.  Then I ordered a bunch of appetizers for all 6 of us to share.  Almost all of the food items were mediocre at best and the server did not even order one of apps I had requested.  Because of the sub par apps, I thought it might be best to try their signature pizzas.  So I tracked down our waiter....I had to get up and find him to put in the order, and ordered a pizza for the table.  The pizza cam 30 minutes later, even after a few people at the table had grown tired of waiting and left, and still we got no apologizes or update on the pizza.10 minutes before the pizza, the check had already been dropped with the pizza on the bill.        I am a huge fan of good beer places and outdoor areas but Jupiter should be ashamed of how bad their service and cleanliness has become.  Even the menus were sticky and grimy.  I think this is a great atmosphere and the beer selection is the only reason this is a 2 star review and not a 1 star.  Maybe this place needs new or better managers because it was a very diss appointing experience for our entire group and none of us are picky about this kind of stuff at all."
136,"I went to Jupiter Pizza restaurant about 3 weeks ago and ordered appetizers - spinach and cheese dip and your fig dessert.  After the waitress dropped off the food, I noticed that there was a  hair in the fig dessert.  I tried to call her over several times.  I understand that she was busy but there were times that she wasn't.  I waved repeatedly every time she would come in room.  It was 15 minutes before she came to our table.  On top of that, and the worst part was that instead of apologizing for the hair, she said that she can't control the partcles that are in the air and that can land on the food,  What?!!!!  I'm sorry,but that hair was deep in the fig, and what the hell kind of a comment is that!  I hope they ramp up their service, because this is just bad.  I won't be coming back anytime soon."
137,"The service has always been very attentive and friendly, the outside patio is lovely (lovelier in the sun, by the fire pit, or under a warm heat lamp) and I remember when they used to have music at night during dinner (do they still?).  However, I don't remember their pizzas being doused in oil.  This past visit, I got a personal potato pizza (because why not combine my two favorite things: pizza and potatoes! and carb my way to whale-size status) but the pizza came so oily that even after squeezing, ringing and blotting it multiple times did not help and drowned out the rest of the flavors :(  The veggie burger, which had come highly in the past was also pretty greasy, and not something I would come running back to order, although, BOMB BBQ sauce!  Seriously, smother it on everything and anything!"
138,Had to wait awhile for our food. The place was extremely packed though. They charge you for each soda which is bull imo. I asked for a second and they never brought it. The food was good though.I probably wouldn't go back unless a friend wanted to go there.
139,"Service was slow. Waiter checked on us every half hour. Bruschetta was burnt and soggy and sucked. The place doesn't have an indoor restroom, so enjoy sharing the bathroom outside with the homeless guy washing his underwear in the sink.  Not a fan, alot of the 5 star reviews are from college kids and we all know how their taste buds are(i.e better than Kraft Mac and Cheese). Beer was not good and expensive.  Will not be coming back."
140,I just want to let you know how important it is to actually answer your phone. My friend may have accidentally left something very important at the restaurant and we have been trying to call for 20 minutes to see if it is there and NO ONE answers - unacceptable. I will think twice before every coming back.
141,"Misleading info on website and Yelp!! Stated open until 2am, which it is but alcohol only...this is NOT indicated on website!! We walked in at 12:03am and were told kitchen closed at midnight. Really?!!!! My party of 4 would have dropped $100+! So instead of accommodating customers looking for good food and drinks after a Greek Theatre concert the inconsiderate, rude, and unhelpful staff sent us down the street to Mel's Diner. Really?!!!"
142,"Cannot begin to elaborate on how disappointed I was with Jupiter. Was looking forward to coming here for the first time all week with a group for a friends birthday bar crawl last night. It was raining so obviously the patio was closed. It was also slammed due in part to the fact that it was the eve of the Big Game and apparently Jake ""who gives a shit"" Gyllenhaal was upstairs undoubtedly talking about the challenges of making a film like Donnie Darko. I have no problem with being 3 deep at a bar or having to wait to get a beer during a busy night, but here's my beef. The place isn't set up to support such a crowd. Every 3 seconds I had another server pushing their way through everyone, including me, bumping our drinks and being pretty damn snobby about it. Then the ""manager"" came and asked a few of my group to move away form the servers station area. I asked him where they should move to since it was the only available standing area. He said ""well in case you couldn't tell, it's pretty busy."" To which I replied, ""then don't let people in if you're at capacity."" No one forced you to let us in, if you can't handle the people, don't let them in, or at least find us a place to go if you don't like where we are.  Rude service and mismanagement had 12 of us out the door in one drink when we would have spent much more, but I guess we weren't cool enough to stay. Beer selection saved it from a one star."
143,"This is great for the young-and-trendy crowd - and boy, is ""crowd"" the right word. The beer is also pretty tasty. The food is alright, but it's really more a place you go for the ambience and hype than for the actual fare."
144,"Went in last night to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. The bartender (who said his name was David) was the biggest asshole I have ever encountered behind a bar. We went up to the bar and I asked if they do birthday drinks, to which he replied ""By birthday drink do you mean am I going to buy you a drink for your birthday, or do you want me to float a candle in your glass?""That should have been a clue...He ended up giving my BF a pomegranate cider for free (like any other civilized bar in the country) and I ordered an apple cider. The apple cider was DISGUSTING!!!! It tasted like either the lines hadn't been cleaned in over a year or they screwed up and gave me bad chardonnay. When I went in to complain and ask to switch for another type of cider (there was about 2mm drunk from the PAID FOR cider), David refused and said he would have to charge me to switch it.We left as soon as my BF finished his pomegranate cider (which wasn't too bad, kind of tasted like Ocean Spray's cran-apple juice), when I left I asked his name and told him that he is one of the worst bartenders I had ever seen, to which he snickered and thanked me.I had talked to the server about what happened, but there was nothing she could do since the manager had left about 30min before and the bartender was now the supervisor.Do not go to this place. I keep giving it chances and every time the bartender/slow waitstaff has given me another reason to stay away.I'm done trying."
145,"This place is doing absolutely nothing to improve the world's starvation problem. We waited for one hour to receive our small pizza, salad, and cup of soup. The waiter's consolation: one free beer. I'm sorry, we ordered three beers, received one free, ordered three food items, received none of them at all, and you want to give us one free beer? Worst service and worst customer service I've experienced at a restaurant in my life. I'm still starving."
146,"It's too bad, really. For 3 years I called Jupiter my ""Cheers"" place. Most of the employees and certainly everyone behind the bar know me as Rob. Most times, they know which beer I prefer and many times are pouring as I step up to the bar. Although I usually come alone, I have always felt comfortable enough to leave my coat on my chair, confident that it would be there when I get back. It always has been. There are usually two employees waiting at any given time that at least know I have been a regular for quite some time. Last evening, my visit to Jupiter was not so pleasant. I got up from my chair and went to the restroom and got a beer. I wasn't gone more than 3-4 minutes. For the first time in three years, my table had been cleared and my coat missing. The people at the next table said to check with the staff. One of the waitresses who has worked there for a while (I apologize for not remembering her name) said a new employee had taken it to the manager because he thought I had abandoned it. I asked why she didn't correct the situation and she responded that I should be grateful that he was protecting my property. I reminded her I had only been gone for about three minutes and she responded that she would get the manager. I thought I should follow her in to get my coat and ask the manager to instruct his over zealous employee to delay before bussing a table that only has one customer. The manager (Ted, I believe. I apologize if I got the name wrong) came out with my leather coat and said in a rather sharp tone, ""Is this your jacket?"" After I identified the jacket, he proceeded to chide me about being ungrateful that his employee had somehow protected my property by bussing the table immediately after I got up. I told him I didn't appreciate the reception he gave me and I most likely would not come back. He said he didn't like my attitude and if he saw it again, he would ask that I not come back. It was at this point that I decided to leave my full beer and tab out and never come back. I was insulted by this whole scene. I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly thought that you could no longer be secure that you could get up and go pee without someone stealing, or as I found out from the waitress who knew me as a regular, a bus boy clearing your table and taking your belongings to the manager? Then to have the manager treat you as an antagonist for reacting to your missing property? The whole point of leaving my jacket was to mark the table as occupied. I felt secure I could do this because of my familiarity. As I was paying my tab, I explained in an irritated tone that I would not be back because the manager has decided I have an attitude. He went over and asked the manager what happened. The manager then stepped over to me and barred me from Jupiter as a sour grapes gesture. A school ground move, really. I'm gonna miss most of the people there."
147,"They gave me a drink that had a milk dripping from the bottom of it (left from a spill on the tray), which stained my shirt, and never even brought me napkins to blot it up. When we were ready to leave, we had to wait over a half hour to get our check, and they lost the credit card for one of my dining companions, and didn't even comp us anything."
148,"Food and beer are excellent. Service is non-existent. We sat down in the patio area and waited for 15 minutes. No greeting,, no menus, no water, no wait person. Nothing. Finally, my husband had to go to the bar to order."
149,"Went with a large group of people. As the only apparently disabled person I have to say that their service not only seriously underwhelmed me, but their consideration for people with disabiies is nil.The pub is mult-storied yet has no way for people to easily navigate around unless they can walk - they are most definitely not disabled friendly. Their waitstaff is rude, has no consideration for customers - not even disabled ones. They treat you as though you are in their way and as though you, being disabled, only want to make their work more difficult for them.I didn't eat or drink anything there based on their treatment of me I spent a small amount of time actually at a table, far away from the group I had gone there to meet. So there wasn't much point in staying there and I had to sadly leave my friends much earlier than originally planned.So they get two stars based on all of the above. Since I don't know how their food or drinks are I'm leaving them two stars as they were packed and thus may have good food and drinks, but they didn't give me a chance to find out.*MEH* is just about right."
150,"Great bar/brewery with great food, now. However, I'm gluten free (massive itching when I ingest wheat) which means that beer and pizza are out. And honestly, salad and olives don't fill up a growing girl!"
151,"The service was very slow even though the restaurant was not busy. It was a pretty nice day but the restaurant was so cold that I had goose bumps. After waiting thirty minutes for one pizza (The Andromeda- advertised as a four cheese pizza) it came burnt, had very little cheese, and wasn't filling for two people.I wouldn't recommend this place for pizza and I do not plan on returning."
152,"I'm a 38 year-old Berkeley resident.  I went here to meet friends for dinner and was not greeted by a host or by waitstaff, but by a teenage bouncer who turned me away!  Would not let me in the door!  (I'd left my ID at home in my gym bag.)  They don't have a manager with in-tact judgment who can welcome a 38 year-old adult in for dinner??  Only in America.On my two-mile walk home (we'd car-pooled) I vowed never to return.  I'd been there quite a few times before (always someone else's pick), (and I don't remember being ""carded""),  and I already didn't like that you have to scream to be heard like you're at a high school dance when the music is playing.  It's not a decent place to go to catch up with friends.  May be a good place to go with a roommate you're tired of listening to."
153,"A crowded local pub/hangout near Berkeley campus. It seemed to have too many waiters tripping over each other,  yet as I tried to find a table the staff ignored me. The place does have a nice courtyard out back for outdoor seating - if you can find a seat - but then a waiter told me they didn't serve food to the tables at the back of the courtyard (too far to walk?). Not much in the way of healthy fare on the menu - it featured high-calorie pub food.    I won't be back."
154,WHY do people like this place?  It's dirty and the food is barely passable.
155,"Not even a chance.We checked in and out w/n 5 min.  When my friend asked the host if he needed to take down our names or can we walk in, he said to us "" give me a second"".... ok, a SECOND had passed, we were still waiting...we thought he was the only one working at the door, but NOO...this girl next to him was working at the door, too and she just stood there?!? she then asked if we were waiting for a table? Hello, didn't you just see us asking the host the question? I was really confused at that point.  Anyway, she finally let us in, and we told the staff we just want something to drink, we'll go chill at the bar.  We got up to the bar, there were only 4 stools? a bar with only 4 stools?over it."
156,"Yeah..think this will be my last time coming... waiter brings a burnt pizza and he trys to blame it on the oven and we ask for one that isn't burnt and his respond is Whatever.   Then he comes back and says that we can have our pizza at a cheaper rate.... cause we would have to wait another half hour for a new pizza .... Just for the record, don't try and make your customers eat burnt food..."
157,"I love the food and beer here and have been here many times. Met some friends here after work one night to have dinner, we made it our destination for the night just to hang out. While waiting for a table outside (which was next to impossible with how busy it was), we decided to put our names down on the list inside and each get a beer/cider while we were waiting. I waited at the bar to order beers for us and when I got up there, the bartender (kyle I believe, had long dark hair tied up with chopsticks) immediately cut me off midsentence to say something along the lines of ""you know what bro? I can tell youre super drunk, so im not serving you anything. Step away from the bar"". I was immediately furious seeing as I just came from work to have dinner, but he treated me as if this was the 5th bar I stopped at for the night. I told him he needed to bring me his manager and he rudely brushed it off. I waited for 10 minutes and he never went to get the manager. Eventually he decided he wanted to say something to me again, and rudely yelled at me about how the drink I was asking for wasnt currently available, and I explained to him that if he had only let me even finish my sentence he would have known that I was just asking for something SIMILAR to that one, and that I KNEW it wasnt available. He continued to take other people's orders and eventually came over and said ""you know what bro? I can tell youve sobered up a bit now, so ill serve you if you want, but youre welcome to go somewhere else"". Told him I didnt want a drink anymore and would be leaving after talking to the manager. He still didnt bring the manager so I had to ask a server. The manager (samantha I think, may have had tattoos) acted like she really couldnt care less and didnt offer to mediate the situation in any way, and that the bartender is just something they have to deal with sometimes because he has a ""strong personality"". Terrible, terrible experience. We left and had dinner elsewhere. I will go back to jupiter in the future because it is a nice place to eat, but those two employees were really bad. Absolutely horrid service from kyle the bartender."
158,"Pretty good pizza. Great beers. Patio is cool. Watch your server: we asked him to split the check (there were three of us and we each ordered something different, no shared food). He split it wrong. He 'corrected' it  but both charges went through. ""It should come off at the end of the night, and if it doesn't just call us."" GERRRR. So yes, two stars for making my dinner way more of a headache than it ever should be."
159,"Visited Sat 30March2013.For a brew pub, I was shocked at the quality of the beer. The hop beer tasted mostly like carbonated water with essence of any beer flavor. The same went for the  dark beer my niece had.  She wasn't impressed at all.The veggie pizza had a significant border of crust.  My son's pizza wasn't anything special according to him, and my sausage/pep pizza was also lacking.I had high hopes but don't plan to return.  Maybe it was just an off day, but the fact that we all had a bad experience suggests otherwise."
160,Security sucks!  Asked for ID's of certain people and not everyone...smh
161,"Salty pizzas!! What happened tonight, did the pizza makers in there get salt shaker happy??!! I don't see any other reviews about this issue, are people just to drunk to realize that even the dough is super-saturated with salt??Ordered 6 pizzas, the most salty one is the one with shrimp (can't remember the name.) It is possible that I may have overdosed on sodium tonight... But i guess it helps to sell beer!!Good items: Beer, artichoke dip, bruschetta and bread, potatoes.I do not ever want to eat another salty pizza again."
162,"The beer here is decent, but if you're looking for something to eat, keep moving. The food here is consistently terrible -- poorly conceived and sloppily put together.The joint can also get crowded and noisy, and the staff are pretty indifferent. The bathrooms are purely disgusting.I only go here when I have to... and my boyfriend loves the beer, so I ""have to"" pretty regularly."
163,"What are we, invisible? Sat for 15 minutes and got not even a glance from a server, despite low attendance. Same terrible server from our last bad Jupiters visit. Oh well, Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen instead, it is!"
164,"Pizza was ok. I liked the wheat crust, but not the cheese. Ambiance is nice, but a bit noisy."
165,"The only thing I liked here was the pizza.  Apparently on weekends they begin to card after 8pm.  Tell me what the difference is when a parent brings their teenage child to this place and NOT get carded and then have 1 person that's under 21 come along with a bunch of people who are all mostly over 23?!  I don't care if they were with their parents or not they shouldn't have one sided rules. Second one of the hostesses was the RUDEST person I've ever met.  I simply asked about the wait and she yelled at me with so much attitude!  Hostesses are suppose to be NICE and welcoming not rude, presumptious and snooty!!  If our waiter was as good as he was I would have talked to the manager.  They don't allow reservations.. and charge $5.00 if you ask them to place a cake in the fridge.  Lame but nonetheless I'll come back to order pizza TO GO."
166,"I visited Jupiter for the first time recently.  A friend's son was performing with a Jazz group that night.  One star for the Jazz group, which was amazing.  I had not heard them before.  One star for the decorations/ambiance.  There is a big tree dead in the middle of the stage, which makes for a very cool background.  No more starts due to the service.  Our server for the night was a woman named Carly.  Unlike most servers who are friendly and courteous, she appeared to be strung out and was very rude.  Our table tried to flag down other servers to help us in order to get better service.  When I go to a place like Jupiter I go to relax and relieve stress, not feel as if I'm the burden of a stressed out waitress.  I have a hard time giving this place any more stars now based on the low level of professionalism coming from its staff.  A part of me would like to give this place another chance since it is so close to where I just moved to.  I will update my review if I visit again."
167,"Basically this place is a nightmare.In 2010  it was just 2 of us and we were seated on the patio  at a table the size of a Frisbee.Freakfest everywhere. The waiter took over 15 min just to bring us 2 waters. Came back 10 min later for food order. When he left he said ""Peace be with you brother"". WTF was that all about.?Ten minutes. later some wild looking redhead comes over and says ""would like me to read your aura""? WTF is going on in this joint. Seriously , waiters with tie dye shirts and flip flops in a restaurant. Some weird band was playing,  their instruments were a wash board and a bamboo pole with a melon at the end.  The ""singer"" was dancing around like she was  on acid banging a tambourine so hard it sounded like a train wreck.The food finally comes to our table and it tasted like  slop.Trust me their not too shy with their prices. If you really think this is a cool place well my suggestion to you is go over to SF and have a real dinner.Never again."
168,"The Food is very good, and this is an issue, because I want to go to Jupiters, but if I do, and I don't go with a group of about 8-10 people the waitstaff will treat me like shit.I have tried to go here twice with a girlfriend and both times we never saw the waitperson again after the initial taking of the order. The times we went it wasn't so badly crowded that we should wait, but the orders were usually botched and the waitperson was rude to the point of sillyness. I comlained twice to the webpage but never got a reply.They really suck and don't care at all about two people, but if you are a group the waitstaff will go all out."
169,"BAD: fancy snooty attitude. no hard alcohol license. no fries. no diversity (super white and hetero vibe, like that of Boston College).GOOD: hummous platter's pretty good with nice kalamatas."
170,"Overrated! I've been here a few times over the years and every time I go I leave kind of disappointed. My fellow Berkeley students tend to love this place...It's a joint for hipsters without cars so they cant go to Downtown Oakland and go where the real hipsters go haha.We once came here after finals (i begrudgingly came) all of us were happy the semester was over, our brains were fried and we were starving. Even though it was still relatively early and the crowd wasn't in full swing, we waited over an hour for our food! And when the receipt came back they charged us for two items we never ordered!!!!Tons of beer selections but i'm a vodka/cranberry kind of girl so it's not that grand in my opinion. The only beer i like is Hefeweizen and some weird stuff they don't have here that's from Europe. Also on a separate occasion (again i went scowling all the way) my ex bf and I were here waiting for a few friends so we let the wait staff know we need a table for 6. When they sat us after 5-10 minutes the manager came to our table and said... You guys can't sit here, we have people waiting! I said we had made reservations for 6 and I had just talked to my friends and they were finding parking (why do i need to explain myself?) he seemed really perturbed even though we had already ordered 2 pizzas for everyone!   What a dick!!! Needless to say my friends arrived 5 minutes later...we didnt tip well that night!I try to avoid this place at all costs but for some reason its a fav amongst a ton of my friends so time and time again I end up here...especially around finals and midterms!"
171,"Um...yeah...2 1/2 stars...service great, food run of the mill. Bathroom filthy, and a look into the kitchen walking by...not so clean.I'll go back for beer on the patio...that's it."
172,"Well, for me ... the best thing about this place is the jazz. Other than that ... it's really only decent. Plus, I'm not really a beer or wine drinker ... and they don't serve whiskey. Booooo!Furthermore, my friend was the lady that got red wine spilled on her white coat, dress, shirt and panties ... while being offered no real support from the wait staff, and only taken away by the police. A very sad display of mishandling racial dynamics and even a poorer display of customer service. Granted, it is difficult to think about the dynamics of race as they meet customer service, while dealing with varying levels of humiliation ... however ... the staff have to be trained to deal with such trying situations. The fact that the police came and escorted a mistreated customer out of the restaurant is simply ridiculous. Compassion training might help.If you want more information, Sarah talked about it as well. Nonetheless ... I will not be going to Jupiter ever again. I'll have to get my  jazz fix elsewhere. Word."
173,"Jupiter has gone downhill recently. They changed the Beer to what they call more ""California style"" and it's so bitter I was sending the beer back.The food is fine, although a little more variety wouldn't hurt.Music is cool, it's one of teh few places left to hear jazz that isn't just standards."
174,The other reviews complaining about service turned out to be right on key. If this place had a clue they would hire more servers &amp; more bussers which would equate a higher turnover. Seems like simple math.I had the spinach tuna salad which was very bland. when i requested olive oil &amp; vineger they responded that 'they were out of vineger' i found this interesting since it was used to make my (soggy) bruschetta appetizer. I didn't order the pizza but it did look good.Atmosphere &amp; music were pretty sweet.
175,"This review is unfortunate, because their food is delicious.  But I will never return to a place run by a manager that disrespects my girl; that is -not- ok.  Please learn some respect for your customers Mr. Manager."
176,Excellent selection of beers. But the Female bartender tonight very argumentative and unfriendly. There are enough bars in Berkeley I will go elsewhere next time.
177,"The good:- an easy, thoughtless choice: downtown + beer + food.- indoor and outdoor seating for those who care- lots of people stirring about- food is acceptableThe bad:- ONLY beer and wine. Go get your vodka soda elsewhere.- very long waits for food (like, 45-60 minutes to receive), which they usually warn you about when you sit down.- too busy so you can often get stuck outside where it is effing cold- atmosphere is scattered and awkward feeling ; the chi isn't exactly flowing here, in my opinion. I can't really relax here the way I can at Beckett's.- food is just acceptable and pricey for the quality- the wait staff is not always so chipperJupiter's problem is that it doesn't know if its a bar or a restaurant. In the end, it does just a so-so job at both. Food and table service ain't insanely good; watering hole mood is a bit cold and scattered."
178,"I've never had a good experience at Jupiter. There is usually some problem with seating. The food seems overpriced. I remember once ordering some shrimp there that was priced as dinner, but turned out to be a tiny appetizer of 5 pieces. I can't remember if you can order mixed drinks at Jupiter as well as beer, but it seems like mainly a beer place. If you don't like beer, it probably detracts from the experience."
179,"You know they do have a lot of good beers, and the food is decent, but I'm not really into the whole crowded college bar thing. The place always is noisy and the service can be anywhere from great to really crappy. I've been there many, many times and I decided finally to write up a review. But when I started to think back over it I realized that most of why I went there either was because it was convenient or because someone else said ""Hey, let's go to Jupiter"".If I have a hard on for beer I drive across the bridge and find parking and hang out at Toronado and get food from one of the little places near there."
180,"Jupiter is a mystery to me, and has been for years, because they have one of the most open and inviting live music venues in town, with great food and a good selection of beer and wine, but some of the worst food service I have ever experienced. It is massive potential, squandered.The building has two floors of tables for drinking and dining, with a huge outdoor area for both, and live music as well. They even have a fountain with a fire pit in it, why can't they hire good servers?!"
181,bad host / hostess +bad server / manager on duty +bad / cold pizza +no service upstairs=15 unhappy guests
182,"Awesome pizza with goat cheese and sliced potatoes!! Great cider on tap.  Have had better bruchetta from a box.  Cute as could be patio--however the worst service ever!!  (Hence the star rating) They need to hire more staff, we had our beers brought by the bussers after sitting there without for 20 minutes, after it took her 28 minutes to come to the table in the first place.  Sucks how service soured this experience."
183,"Jupiter.It's a love it or leave it kind of joint.  Ostensibly a great place to hang out and have a few beers, it has some major flaws, and some serious problems with customer service.The high points:  their in-house beers are pretty good.  They tend towards the ""I'm an American micro-brew, see how hoppy my beers are"" end of the spectrum, but they have good flavor, even if they all skew towards hoppy and bitter.  If that's your pint of beer, Jupiter has it in spades.Definitely pricier than your average bar.  Most beers are $4.50 a pint, and the bartenders don't mind giving you an inch or two of foam...below the rim of the glass.  But, their beers are good, and they have tasty third-party brews, too (Old Speckeled Hen on tap).Food is mediocre; tasty, but insubstantial and somewhat expensive.  You will not find traditional bar food here, which can be an upside for some, but you'll shell out $20 if you want to feel full and satisfied on Jupiter's tiny portions and skinny pizzas.Service is regularly awful.  I've had good waiters, but they're far and few between.  I've been going to Jupiter for almost 10 years, and i swear I've never had the same server twice.  Or even *seen* the same waiter twice (although it's really a once a month event for me).My big knock on Jupiter is that they treat drinking customers like restaurant patrons.  I went there with a 6-top, which means we get the 18% gratuity.#1  18% is unreasonable.   18% is for great service, not ""just because.""  15% is what's called for, here.#2  Jupiter isn't a restaurant.  it's a bar that serves food.  If I sit down at almost any bar and order drinks, and maybe a side of fries, i don't get dinged for an additional gratuity.  Jupiter's off its nut, here.#3  The automatic gratuity for larger parties assumes and implies that the larger party = more work.  With Jupiter, you don't get water unless you beg for it, you don't get silverware unless you beg for it, you don't get plates unless you beg for it, and you sure as hell aren't getting a drink unless you beg for it.These were the points *we* raised with the management when our 6-top, which had ordered ~$60 of food from the waiter and 6 drinks, and then got the next 20 drinks from the bar because our waiter was inattentive.  Why the 18% gratuity for a waiter who never came around, and when he finally did ""hey, can I refill that beer?"" I had to point out my friend carrying fresh pints ""that's alright, we just went to the bar.""And the manager!  A piece of work.  I don't need to have my weiner jerked by a service industry worker at all, I'm not that kind of jerk.  But this manager...Here's the exchange:Me:  Hey, what's with this 18% gratuity?  Our waiter was never here, we had to get our beers from the bar, get our own water, what are we paying for here?Manager:  well, I know him, he's a great waiter, so realy this a failure to communicate on your part.  You can pay the gratuity or not or whatever, but I'm going to trust him.Hello.  Think about it Mr. Manager, is that the way to play this?  We would have gladly paid the gratuity, we just wanted to have some recognition that we thought our service sucked--it doesn't make a lot of sense to tell your customers that you think they're liars.I've spent thousands of dollars at Jupiter.  I love the Quasar, and I knock back 5-8 of them when I go there, and because i get drunk & hungry, I eat a good $30 worth of food.I'm not going back.It's really simple to placate a customer--you don't have to give an inch, just lend a sympathetic ear.  We came out for a good time, and you crapped on it.  I'm sure Jupiter won't go under due to losing my patronage, but they've also lost our monthly company Happy Hour (last month's tab was $400), and i don't have any friends that are teetotalers.  And I'm genuinely pissed.  Way to make friends, morons."
184,"Okay, I'm saying it: I don't like Jupiter. When there isn't a ginormous wait in the cold, there's spotty table service or bitchy bussers. The pizza is alright, nothing amazing, and the beers are similar. On the outside, Jupiter is wonderful. It has a cute outside area with lights and heaters as well as nice pub feel indoors. But really, it's just mediocrity. I came here tonight and was so dissatisfied I had to write this review before I forgot about my experience. Our server seemed like she couldn't care less about us - took 25 minutes to bring out a cup of water, forgot to put in my drink order, rudely tried to hand us our bill before we were even close to finishing (keep in mind, the place was not crowded)! It's not like she did anything all that bad but I just did not appreciate her ambivalence and disregard for us. I ordered the cassiopeia pizza and it was doused in BBQ sauce in such a way that reminded me of a child assembling their own lunchables pizza and going crazy with the sauce. After the server remembered to put my hot chocolate order in, she brought it back to me after it had been sitting for so long that the drink was no longer hot. We had friends join us for drinks after dinner but our dirty plates sat on the table staring at us as from 8-10 as each server and busser walked by, ignoring our table. After we were firmly told to go downstairs after the upstais closed, I handed a random scarf that was left behind at my table to an employee, trying to be helpful. The woman didn't reply to me at all, just glared, and continued wiping up the table. I'm over you, Jupiter. I liked you when I was a bumbling college kid but my tastes have refined and you no longer fit the bill.** While I have experienced better, I would come back to Jupiter simply because it serves a purpose. It's convenient for grabbing dinner and then hanging out with friends later, a good loitering place if you will. But i'm not crazy about it!"
185,"Anti-smoke nazis galore!  What used to be my favorite drinking spot has slowly over time metamorphasized into a family-oriented snobbery, complete with screaming kids and cliques du jour.If you don't want to read the nostalgiac musings of an old Jupiter regular - move on now.Ahh the glory days of Jupiter!  I settled in on this spot sometime in the late 90's, mainly due to their awesome outdoor patio area and the swingin' staff.  You could smoke anything anywhere you liked, and the servers were just as drunk and high as you were half the time.  (Oh, who am I kidding - way more than half the time!)  I made dozens of friends there, just sitting around drinking beers, buying rounds, and gathering tables of whoever drifted in.  It was festive!Then there was Beatdown.  Thursday nights you could expect the Beatdown crew (Delon, Yamu and Add 1) to show up and lay out the tracks that kept that place so up-tempo it made ME dance.  That's like selling lighters in hell, folks, so take note - good f'ing music and great scene = dancing for me.But alas!  Those times passed.  First, they came for the smokers indoors and the non-smokers said it was just the inside.  Then, they came for the smokers near the inside, and the non-smokers said it was just so they didn't have to smell it inside.  Then they came for the smokers outside, and the non-smokers said we like it outside too.  Then they came for the smokers who hid in the very back, down a dark alley near the street, and the non-smokers said you shouldn't be smoking anyway.  Just this year they finally shoved the smokers out completely - you have to leave entirely and go out to the sidewalk like a leper - and there were no smokers left to complain.(hint: head down to Becketts or Thalassa if you want to drink and smoke)The staff changed as well.  Gone were the party animals and in came the endlessly rotating staff of nameless servers.  Stay away from Jupiter for more than a couple months and you'll have to memorize all new names.  The decor turned Applebees, along with the clientele.  No longer did you have bar-hopping drunks having fun - no sir - now the era of 25-person parties and family-out-for-a-meal to keep you company.  No comment on the bands.I give it two stars for what it is, in contrast to the five stars I would have given it as many years ago.  The only thing that got better in the past decade was the food.  The outdoor grill serving finger-foods is a massive step up from the (delicious) pizza only menu.Side note: The rats that some have complained about do not come from Jupiter's kitchen - there is an alleyway right on the other side of the ""panini"" area wall that has trash storage in it.  That's where they come from."
186,"Like a few of the reviews here, the 1-star reflects the bad service, and not the quality of the food. The food and beer were good, definitely worth what we paid for. However, the service really leaves a lot to be desired.My boyfriend and I we're content with sitting inside facing the street, where there were at most 2 patrons at a time (fairly slow that afternoon). We ordered beer, some chicken wings, and some more beer. We we're very much engaged in conversation so we weren't even paying much attention to the time, until we realized that the credit card holder (with our card in it) has been sitting on our table for awhile. We decided to try flag down our waiter. We didn't see our waiter for a few minutes, but we managed to flag him down soon after. He took our card and left. My bf and I went back to chatting. After what seemed like awhile, we looked around for him, didn't see him. We started timing him. More patrons started showing up, and we see our waiter, but he is constantly doing something/engaging other customers and not even looking our way. 30 mins pass. We didn't see him again, so I walked to the bar where there was a waitress, a guy bartender, and a girl who could've been either (she was behind the bar so I knew she wasn't a customer). I approached them (they we're all chit-chatting) and politely asked for our card. The waitress looks at me for a moment, then points at our waiter (who has returned and is entertaining another table) and says, "" he will be right with you shortly, he's just a little busy."" Really?? This was right next to the cash register too, where I could just reach out and take our card, but I thought that would be inappropriate. I was stunned, but I turned and gave our guy another chance. We decided 15 minutes was too long to wait for our card that could've been easily handed over to us, so we decided to wait by the door so that our waiter will see us and remember/not ignore us. Some girl at the bar asks us, ""Can we help you?"" in a fairly loud voice, and I firmly said, ""We are waiting for our credit card."" Still nobody from the bar really did anything than look at each other. It did get the attention of our waiter (who seemed to have genuinely forgot about us), and he gave us our card with a mumbled,""Sorry, I didn't know they left it there..."" ?? I'm not sure what he meant, I don't really care. All I know is that waiting almost an hour for our credit card to be returned to us when there are atleast 3 other people who could've helped us is obviously NOT good service."
187,"Take my advice: just go there for beer, perhaps some munchies but don't get any real food. walk down the street somewhere and get some real chow. Pizza = burnt + cold + has hairSalad= too much dressing, too sour, frozenbeer= great homebrew, one thing that this place does right is beerThe atmosphere is the only thing this place has going for it. I would rather take the BART into the city and go to a real bar. I've been to Jupiter 5 times now. I was trying to keep an open-mind but I don't know why people rank it so high. Perhaps they just experience euphoria from the alcohol."
188,1 star for a nice patio-1 star for consistantly bad service1 star for decent enough food-1 star for mediocre to undrinkable beersanother -1 star for the absence of the hard liquor you would like to be drinking to banish the taste of that horrible beer from your mouth1 star for location (only by default)1 star for the outdoor firepit. Just becuase I like fire! Not becuase I like this place!At least it's better than Blake's.
189,"Food was ok, beer was good, staff was good, but we had a horrible waitress. Gave us crap for ordering coffee at a bar, then gave us crap for erdering liquor ( they have beer/wine only), took her three requests to get water, chewing gum and not working for the %18 gratuity they impose on 6 or more. I'm normally just fine with a 'group tax' but it's not an excuse to ignore me, it's personal especially when I'm with friends. Manager was receptive so I'll give it another whirl but not for a while."
190,"Like whatever...... its Bezerkeley with the we will gladly let you wander around to eventually find a seat mentality, and a complete lack of any sense.  Do come though for the very diverse menu, showcasing pizza & beer, and to find yourself surrounded by the inane chatter of whatever idiots you might be unlucky to be surrounded by.  The pomegranate cider according to the wifey was absolutely terrible. She described it as are they serious this must be some kinda watered down Bezerkeley Kool Aid. Frankly I would not waste my time taking a trip from the city where there are far better options, but what the hell, if find yourself in the vicinity do enjoy a decent pizza & beer two or three......"
191,"The boyfriend and I decided to have an early dinner before I had to head of to work so we took a table outside (which was nice) but had a terrible server. I'm thinking she was rude because we looked young but hey, there is no excuse for bad service. She gave me a snooty little attitude when I asked how big the salads were, she never went by the table to check how the boyfriend and I were doing and she took FOREVERRRRR to give us our bill. I wish the food could have made up for the service but it didn't. The salad was less than mediocre and the pizza lacked what I like to call flavor. Judging by the hoards of good reviews I'm guessing I went on an off night? Whatever, I'm not planning to go to Jupiter anytime soon."
192,"They've got $8 nine inch pizzas, or $13 for the twelve-inch ones.Beers are about $4 or 5--good for a brewery.  Don't like the planet/moon/astronomical names for all the food. Kind of lame.Service SUCKED for us.  Went on a Thursday night, after 9pm.  It was fairly busy, but we were seated immediately upstairs.  We waited... waited... waited.  Finally I got up and went to find someone after FIFTEEN minutes (at least).  There were two girls on the other side of the room just hanging out and talking, but as soon as I mentioned we hadn't even seen a waiter/waitress, one of them was over there pronto with menus and an apology. Decent.Food was meh.  The sun dried tomatoes on my pizza were chewy to the point of distraction and the crust was crispy but the middle soggy.  Drinks were good--my dining mates had beer and really liked it.  I had an iced tea, but they never brought me lemon or sugar/sweeteners for it. Bummer--isn't that standard? Oh well.  I guess I'd go back there if I happened to be in the area (which we were), and I just wanted to chill out and have a beer (or several).  One thing I noticed was that you could sit there and only drink and no one would bother you for a good hour, at least.  Good for the intimate couple seated next to us, bad for our extremely thirsty and hungry selves."
193,"Service here was just plain awful and mean tonight.  You're on your own to find a table, and the structure of the place isn't conducive to finding open tables on a crowded night.  Lots of U-turning at dead ends, lots of tables that are being neglected (old dishes on there, tables going to waste).  Upstairs seemed to be the last choice for most, so it was the easiest place to find a spot.  Tables weren't marked as reserved for a private party.  So we sat down at a table, and for this we were publicly humiliated.  The waitress rolled her eyes at other guests, bitchily saying ""is it so difficult to see that this is a jazz festival table?""   All we did was act confused and we received this complete breakdown in professionalism.  After dinner, the waitress tells us to clear out, even though half our party is still working on post-dinner drinks.  We've paid the tab, she's no more money to gain from us, so she just tosses the whole cordiality mask.  As she's clearing the table, she makes snide remarks about how the glasses were greasy and our used napkins were gross.  Just an outright lack of professionalism here.  We didn't really requite the hatred, we were a bunch of grad students in the same program, many of us meeting for the first time, so we tried our best to just focus on the good company, and not the bad service.  Chicken skewers tasted like bark.  Pizza's pizza, though 1 in 4 pizza orderers in my group had theirs burned.  Beers are kinda good, but your glass will be empty for long periods of time before any staff notices.  Just because a place makes a beer doesn't mean you have to kiss their brewmaster's ass about it.  There is such thing as a mediocre microbrew.  There's no house so packed, no pressure so strong, that would warrant the rudeness we suffered tonight.  OK, so I'm writing angry.  To be fair, I had a better experience when I've come here in a twosome.  Maybe my experience tonight is just a testament to how unprepared this place is for a group of 8+.   When you're in a small group, the waitstaff is your standard-issue undermanned, unenthusiastic bunch.    Which I can deal with.  Oh, the other times  I've come with in small groups, the acoustic guitar drivel was nearly unbearable.  At least tonight we had some decent jazz.They have a waitress who looks JUST like that girl from the office, the scowling one: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch…UPDATE: So the owner of the place sends me this sincere apology email.  But I return and nothing's changed, another big group, another night of rudeness.  Thanks for the personal touch over email, but try to translate that into some professionalism in the aisles."
194,"The good points of Jupiter are that they're in a good location (close to BART in downtown Berkeley), they have average priced drinks for downtown Berkeley.  They have reasonably priced and often above average food (like pizza and sandwiches).The good points are far outweighed by the bad service.  I understand that they have to deal with lots of annoying students and other things just as the other bars in downtown Berkeley do.  Yet, they always manage to come off condescending towards their customers while managing to provide piss-poor service.  I'd say you'll have about a 75% chance of getting far sub-par service with attitude and about 25% chance of getting average service.  Never had anything like good service.An example of the bad service was being brought floppy/soggy pizza with cheese running off it that couldn't possibly be eaten by hand.  Plates and silverware were absolutely required, yet they didn't bring any with the food and couldn't be bothered to check on our table until they wanted to give us the bill an hour later.  They carefully pretended not to notice attempts to get their attention .  I practically had to club a worker in the head to get plates and silverware for our party after some people in our party gave up waiting for them and tried to eat by hand with resulting grease and slime dripping down their arms and off their elbows onto the table.Most times I""ve gone there have been service problems such as these, often combined with attitude.  If you're into that go to this place.Otherwise I'd say most other bars in Berkeley that have food will give you better service even if the food isn't as good and you'll save yourself some frustration."
195,"It's nearby and has beer. I like their pizza, rest of the menu is average brewpub fare.The service almost always sucks. We seem to get the same waiter every other time we're here. One day, he sits at a table drinking a soda and refuses to come over and clear our plates or bring the check. We had to walk over to him for the check. Another day, he must've been having cramps. He got all pissy with us. There were other customers, but not really crowded by any means. First he takes away the dishes and leaves the check. Fine. As we're talking and taking too long for him, he comes by twice in a matter of 3 minutes to see if the check was ready to take. Third time he comes to check, he puts it back down in the middle of the table and takes away all the water and soda cups. WTF is that?"
196,"Good beer.  Decent food.HORRID service.  I came here off and on for years and service just starting stinking for no good reason.Waiting for ages to be seated when there's seating all over the damn place that's available.Servers who'd rather hold a conversation than take an order.  You know, it is the little things that add up over time.Do you want my continued business and for me to recommend you to everyone I know, or would you like to lose my business and never reach some customers at all?I started going to Beckett's instead.  If I'm in SF, I'll suffer the Irish Bank even."
197,"Every time I go to Jupiter I'm always a little disappointed.The food is okay, but for the price I would definitely say it is lacking. The pizza, which is supposed to be the focus of the menu, definitely leaves something to be desired. For classy pizza I would choose Cheeseboard every time, and even Bowzer's down the street is better. The sandwiches are small and mediocre. There is no dessert menu, which is also a bummer.The service is always incredibly slow, and it gets really crowded and noisy.Thank god for their beer, otherwise they would really have little going for them. The beer is really good, especially Jupiter's Red Ale, but does not make up for the dull, overpriced food when going out for a meal. For a date or gathering with friends I would go to Beckett's down the street any day."
198,"I'm going to quickly say that I was there to meet friends and am a fan of neither beer nor American pizza. I had some very indifferent wine, but it was the salad and service that earned the low marks. I ordered the spinach salad with tuna which, at that price and in this kind of eatery in this part of the world should be fresh tuna. Shockingly, it was canned. Also the waitstaff was amazingly rude, very snooty pretty young people. I won't be returning."
199,"Good beer selection and the patio is great in the summer.  But the service here is HORRIBLE.  I heard that the servers can have up to 24 tables in their section so don't expect to get even moderately good service at the tables.  Order your beer from the bartender and expect to wait for at least 45 minutes for your food to come out (on a busy night).Also, don't be surprised if the staff does last call and 5 minutes later they're yelling across the bar ""GET THE F@*K OUT OF HERE, WE'RE CLOSED!""  Customer service at it's finest ladies and gentlemen."
200,"Breakdown:Crowd is mostly white, Berkeley folks.They only serve beer, no hard alcohol.  :(They have live music, nothing special.Food selection is limited, pizza (pretty good) and salad.The outdoor patio is nice to just chill at at night if you are with friends, just make sure you sit by the fireplace or a heat lamp. A good friend of mine said she once saw a lot of RATS running around through the outdoor patio.  She said this happened over a year ago, but she was there late night and clearly saw rats running near the fireplace and near the bushes/shrubs that line the seating area.  **This problem MAY have been fixed by now*** I haven't been back since. This is the kinda place you go to if you are already nearby, its not worth the going out of your way for. 2 Stars if rat issue is resolved.  (0 Stars if not)"
201,"Super expensive, mediocre tasting thin crust pizzas.  Crowded for reasons that obviously escapes me (Berkeley students all have way too much money?).  They forgot my order completely, which I felt quite relieved about after eating some of the stuff my friends ordered."
202,"A place just above the downtown Berkeley BART station. That is its best recommendation. OK, not great beer, bad service, too many students. Generally a mediocre college town pub. What makes this interesting is that it is owned by the same group that owns the Triple Rock just down the street which is consistently pleasant."
203,"The bad:1. Pizza is seriously worse than at California Pizza Kitchen. Had a Xanthia and an Andromeda at Jupiter and they sucked.2. The place is very loud. There may be just acceptably spots downstairs in the garden area, but not upstairs.3. The tables are old and those for two are very small.The good:1. They can bring you your cocktail (try red wine + Coca Cola - it's much better than you'd think)2. The place is open late3. They have a heated garden area and a fire pit."
204,"Mediocre food and poor wine. I may be biased however since I can't drink beer nor eat cheese. I tried their pizza without cheese but found it quite poor and burnt. The service is practically non-existant even though they use fancy PDA's for taking orders. You would think it would allow them to serve food faster. Alas, fancy equipment can't make for inept servers. My fiance says they have good beer though, so I'll give it 2 stars."
205,"The pizza here is some of the most original pizza I've had in the Bay Area, assuming that you get the pizza at all. The delicious pizza gets this spot an extra star. Oh but wait a sec... an extra star? Then why only one in total? Well...Last night, we went to Jupiter, knowing already how slow the service is at the restaurant-- we took the slow pace of service into consideration when making our plans. With a show to go to at 9PM, we decided to meet at Jupiter at 6:30. One would think that 2.5 hours would be plenty of time to get food and go. Come 8:45PM, all we had were two appetizers and a few beers. The pizza? Out in space somewhere I suppose. Out on IO? Out in Mercury? Out somewhere. Apparently around 7:45 they had stopped taking orders for food because the kitchen was backed up already. And this was not the first time this has happened to me at Jupiter. One would think that a restaurant inspired by space travel would have food out more quickly. I do not ask for warp speed, but I am not looking for sloth. The waitstaff was friendly and tried to accommodate us and was very apologetic. They were just a tad understaffed, particularly in the kitchen.  We decided to pack up and go. Got the bill, complained to management, and settled for crappy sicilian slices down the block. The saving grace was that the brobras (and I say brobras because that's what they were) behind the counter at the crappy sicilian slice place actually entertained me a little bit, which was more than I can say about the service at Jupiter.Jupiter: Come for the beer, come for the pizza. Stay (and stay and stay and stay)  and leave with an empty stomach."
206,"Jessica our Friday night waitress, ran after us for a $3 tip. A wait staff should never do that.This has never happened, where a wait staff runs out into the street asking for a three dollar extra tip. Jessica next time I'm going to give you a $50 tip so that buffers you and you don't need to chase customers down for $3.Yuk! terrible experience !"
207,"Pizza was good, the beer was fine...but let me tell you about our server Jessica. After we settled the bill, she chased us down outside of the restaurant to ask if anything was wrong. We said that everything is fine and why the question. She responded that the tip was not enough and that she expected more. This put a very sour note on a great evening. I ended up going back to inform the manager of what took place, she said she would speak with Jessica; not expecting much from this.  If you have Jessica as a server and experience her poor attitude and negativity, please put a fat ZERO for a tip which shows her ranking as a server/person. Cheers."
208,This is a cool place to go for a nice dinner.  The ambiance is really nice and it can be  a bit romantic.  I'm not super crazy about the pizza.  I'm all about the bread and the wispy crust just doesnt do it for me.
209,I've been here three times now. I love the food and pizza. Unfortunately the waitresses and waiters look stressed out and probly because of that are rude to their customers. They don't smile or look you in the eye. When my husband asked if there was room outside the waitress rolled her eyes and said I don't know. Too bad to because beer and food is delicious but we won't be back because the customer service is frustrating.
210,"The place is so busy, it's easy to understand why the service can sometimes be terrible. What is more terrible is the food. I don't understand the people who say pizzas at Jupiter are amazing. Have they ever had a pizza in the past? Was it from the frozen department of Pack'n'Save?I ate there two times, got sick twice. I had a doubt at the first time although I had already noticed that nobody has ever told them how to prepare bruschetta (it's not only made of garlic, I'm not kidding - unless if it's added in excess to cover perished food).Anyway! Outside the food that I will never touch again, the atmosphere is cool and the beers are ok"
211,"2.5 starsFood was good for the most part, and if I were just judging on food, it would be 3.5 stars. We got the Triton (sicilian sausage, basil, etc.), the Circe (shrimp, garlic, etc.) and the lamb skewers. The Triton was flavorful and tasted good, but it wasn't amazing. The lamb skewers had good meat, and the tomatoes were good, but it wasn't anything special either, and I've had better lamb skewers for cheaper. The Circe, however, was really good. It tasted really fresh and wasn't very heavy, which I liked. None of the ingredients were too strong, so the flavors blended nicely, and the shrimp was good.However, the service wasn't too good. I liked the fact that they texted you when your table was available, so that allowed you to walk around the city a bit while you're waiting. However, once we were seated and got the menus, we had to wait 15 minutes before the waitress came back to take our orders. I guess it was ok since it was a busy weekend night. However, during the two hours that we were there, the waitress never came by to see how we were doing, or even bother refilling our water. She also underestimated the amount of time that our pizza would take to be done (said 40 min, we waited about 55-60 min). This was happening while the place was getting less busy, when there were a few empty tables around us. She actually checked up on other tables and either didn't see that our glasses were empty or chose to ignore it. It just wasn't a pleasant dining experience, despite the quality of the food. For service, I would just give it 1 star.Would I go there again? Maybe. We were in the restaurant area, which I'm guessing isn't as great of an area as the patio where there is live music. I may go there if there's a good band playing."
212,"Pizza was burnt and service was bad.   Waitress Jessica was rude and came after us asking for more tip of money( $3).  Also the wine tasted out of age like when one keeps an opened wine out for too long or ""recorked"" for too long  Never heading to this place again. Better service and pizza at dominos in my opinion.   Jupiters is far out as the plant I would say!"
213,"jupiter was not good ..this place is over hyped ..the food sucked...I HATE TO WRITE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.. BUT I DONT WRITE FAKE REVIEWS..the back outside seating area was dirty,,nasty,,flies all over the place...mr. jupiter you need to get some degreaser steam clean this place..and that exposed kitchen area buy the restrooms thats nasty!!!!@getting to the food@(PIZZA) was just to salty.I WAS EXPECTING SOME VERY GOOD PIZZA FROM THE WOOD BURING OVEN MAYBE JUST A BAD DAY.(caesar salad) just bland ,,no taste at all..its missing everything ,anchovy ,lemon ,even blk pepper.garlic too.its just sucked...i used the lemon from my soda to try to add some kick..you want to get a beer and some cheap food this is the place too go..\"
214,did they fix the beer yet?  does it still taste infected or contaminated?
215,"our waiter, the curly dark brown hair somewhat bald was a HORRIBLE waiter.  He didn't bring us water nor asked us how our meal went.  When he brought the bill, he just threw it on the table without saying anything.  Our dinner turned out to be horrible, so we will never go back to the restaurant again because of him."
216,"i had just killed some zombies, and that makes you pretty effin hungry.  i went to this place because it was there, and i was not a happy camper.we sat down.20 minutes later a menu came.XX minutes later (couldn't think, so hungry) sub par pizza.this pizza had a hole burnt in two of the pieces.retarded eskimos could make better pizza.that's my measuring tool, by the way.  i'm being politically incorrect:  developmentally challenged inuits could make better pizza.that was one cold review."
217,"I know I am being disliked by many for my rating for Jupiter, but seriously, is this really a pub ! I know Berkeley has very limited to offer and this is one of the few late night hangouts if one decides to stick around on this side of the bay, still, is this really a pub ! Go to Beckett or Triple Rock, both walkable from Jupiter. This place always feels so much like a restaurant with very average food."
218,"For the beer, it'd get 4 stars, but we were there for dinner and the food really wasn't all that great.  The spinach and albacore tuna salad had about 4x too much dressing on it which made it tough to eat.  The Yukon Gold Potato pizza (forget the name they gave it...) was tasty but so incredibly dry that it was hard to swallow.  I got the sense that everything was completely premade and just tossed in an oven to warm it up.  The portions are huge so in terms of value for your $$$ it's pretty good.  It's an interesting building with a very cool wooden staircase right in the middle.  Would we go back again?  No, there are better places around..."
219,I would give this place a 0 if the rating let me. This place is horrible. The service was pompous and inattentive. The food was highly overpriced. The pizza tasted BLAND and COARSE. The beer selection was ok but let's talk about the price of the pizza. $14 FOR A PIZZA THE SIZE OF A INFANT SKULL. In other words small. I could go to round table pizza and get a bigger pie. No thanks.
220,"If you go in a group of 3, don't sit at the picnic table! Those are reserved for groups of 5 or more. Also, when you're outside, the food menu is so limited. The music is good. It was jazz on Friday."
221,"The beer is okay and the food too.  However, the service is terrible and beware of thieves here.  Last time I went here was with a fairly large group.  The wait staff was awful and someone came by and swiped my friend's purse!  When we realized what had happened and that the guy was pretty much gone, we went to our waiter and asked if he could call the police.  He said, ""Don't you have a cell phone?""  Can you believe this?!?!?  He didn't even care that someone had just robbed one of his customers!  I won't go back.  The place has a terrible vibe."
222,"Sure they have a lot of beer. But more then once, they screwed up the taps and gave me a different beer then I asked for. Of course, there's no telling the know-it-all-bartenders there... jack-asses, all of 'em. And the pizza!? Are you kidding me?! Here... let me spread this piece of dough out as thin as I can so make as much money as I can off you Cal-student skanks...  Fuck that place. The scene there fucking nauseating too. And if you really must go, pray there's no fucking music..."
223,"One star for being a mere few drunken stumbles from BART, and another star for having a large outdoor seating area.  That's it.  The beers are alright here, but the food is just meh.  Its pseudo-Mediterranean fare tastes more like a podunk, uncosmopolitan interpretation of Mediterranean food, or maybe a throwback to the 70s when people were more enamored with an idea of a cuisine than the actual cuisine itself.  Come on, it's not that difficult to serve good pizzas and sandwiches!  Service is tenuous especially when it's busy.   Some nights (Fridays and Saturdays, mostly) attract the insufferable, lightweight UC crowd.  And the last time I was there, the entertainment was some dude with a headset mic doing an emo cover of Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" and it was painful.  I'm sure it's better on other nights.  I think the atmosphere and the food at Triple Rock down the street is a bit better."
224,"OK pizzas and beer, but the service is among the worst I've ever seen. Snooty waitresses who have better things to do than their job will ignore you, they'll be out of almost all of the beers on the menu, you'll wait forever for your drinks, you'll never get the water you ask for, and if you order pizza, you might never get  it."
225,"Seriously? You charge for refills of fountain sodas? Give me a break. That in itself is enough to hate you, Jupiter. But, alas, I do like your Quasar and the chicken sandwich isn't bad. Service is, as with most alcohol establishments, super spotty. There just really isn't much at all that I dig about this place, but I just can't get over a charge for refill of diet coke. NOT OKAY!"
226,"I used to come to this place all the time, then a few years ago it started to suck. One night we attempted to have a bit of a birthday celebration there and they told us we couldn't have food, and that if we wanted food we'd have to leave (we weren't loud or anything). It was a bit surreal, but thats Berkeley I guess."
227,"Cool, hip atmosphere but if you're not a beer or wine drinker like me, you'll be out of luck.  Also, most of the menu options are pizza, pizza, and oh, pizza!  I hear their beer is good, so if that's your thing then you'll probably like Jupiter."
228,Sorry James and staff. The staff is great and the food is excellent but until you change the lines out on your beer you only get 1 star. Almost all the beer at Jupiter has a talcum powder taste to it. All these people say how much they love you beer and I hope it's just ignorance. I have many years experience drinking beer and even more years making beer and the only explanation is your lines need to be replaced. I am sure it not a cheap job and you may have to tear up the floor but in the end it's all about quality  right? Right now your loosing business from all the beer connoisseurs in the bay area.
229,"My friends and I had dinner at Jupiter last night and although the food and atmosphere were excellent, the service was terrible. A guy (not our server) brought a tray of beers over and litterally dropped one of them on the table, which SOAKED two of my friends. One friend had soaking shoes and the other got her Marc Jacobs wallet ruined and all of her clothes were soaked. The guy and server were hardly apologetic and the guy brought my friend another beer. One would think this was on the house as a gesture of apology, but NO!!!! A few seconds later the server came over wondering how the two of them wanted to pay for all of the beers. There was confusion and I let the server know my friend though the last one was on the house considering the awful situation. The server hesitantly agreed but still made them pay for everything else. Other patrons urged us to complain to the manager because the situation was so unbelievable, but at this point no one felt like adding any more drama. As much as I would love to start going to Jupiter on a regular basis, this situation will be hard to get over."
230,"After many pleasant enough experiences at Jupiter's as a grad student, I went back last night to celebrate a performance with some friends and was quite disturbed by my experience there.  A few tables over a waitress had spilled wine on a woman's white coat, who was insistent that the manager come out and pay for her coat and/or dry cleaning bill.  Granted, the customer was difficult, but as far as I could tell the manager on the floor did not offer to pay the dry cleaning and ineffectively tried to calm the customer down.  The customer was audibly upset and insisted the night manager get her boss.  She also refused to leave until that happened.  In the end, the manager called the cops to escort the customer out of the restaurant.  To complicate matters, the customer was African-American (one of very few in the restaurant) and once she left one of the wait staff started filling other customers in on the story.  From where I sat it looked like the other (white) customers found the whole thing amusing.  It wasn't.  It was an uncomfortable situation that could have been handled better and faster... which has led me to decide I won't be going back there.  Sorry Jupiters...I think you have some management training to work on!"
231,"My husband and I have been to Jupiter twice now. First time, we found the pizza (we had a shrimp pizza) was no more than mediocore. We returned to Jupiter with some friends last week on Saturday eve. It was very busy, which was to be expected. We had a party of 5 and they warned us that pizza would be a 1 hour wait, other dishes around 20 minutes. So we decided to stay and order other dishes besides pizza. Unfortunately, the two people who had ordered soup as their entree received their soup after about 20 minutes, and the remaining three of us received our meals 30-40 minutes later. The waitress was very apologetic, at least. She told us that there was new kitchen staff. I ordered the chicken skewers with peanut sauce. The dish arrived looking rather sad and pale. the chicken looked anemic and tasted similar. and the peanut sauce had nothing thai about it. it tasted like mayo with a dollup of peanut sauce mixed in. my stomach didn't feel so afterwards, and i don't have a weak stomach. i'm giving this place 2 stars instead of one because out server did comp the whole check because she felt badly, but i don't think we could go back."
232,"Any place that serves decent beer gets 2 stars in my book. The backyard patio gets it 2 more stars. That being said, the food and the crowd take it down -2 stars (It really should be -3 but I am in forgiving mood). The food is mediocre on a good day and down right bad any other day. The artichoke & spinach dip appetizer was terrible, the pizza was under cooked. Do you know what it takes to under cook a thin crust pizza? I do. It takes a packed ale house with a penchant to sling food out asap because it is overcrowded and understaffed. I wondered how and why a place with such low quality food stayed so busy, but I had answered my own question. Its the beer. The beer is good. Beer + college kids is the recipe for success for Jupiter. I'm over it. I'd rather wait for a table at the Triple Rock than waste my money and appetite here."
233,"I'm writing about my overall experience here, which was unfortunately brought down by the last time I dined there.  It was a total disaster.  We ordered two regular meals for lunch, and 40 minutes later, I still didn't have what I ordered, and my boyfriend's meal had arrived within 15 minutes.  Because I watched as it was obviously getting cold, I told him to go ahead, assuming mine would be along shortly.  Then our server never came back, and we literally had to get up and go find her.  She seemed shocked when I told her that I STILL did not have my meal, but more because I got up to tell her, not because she was at all apologetic.  They finally brought out my food, but by that time I was just over it, and didn't want to sit there any longer.  We asked for the check (which we had to again get up to go find the server), and she didn't even have the decency to take my meal off the check. SO RUDE and completely unacceptable.  Have NEVER gone back."
234,"we waited AT LEAST 45 minutes, quite possibly an hour for our pizza to come on a monday night. i mean, sure, maybe friday or saturday, but monday? and the tomatoes were flavorless, and there were hardly any mushrooms, artichoke hearts, or spinich, which is why we ordered the thing -- we wanted the goods! come on jupiter. waiter was nice anyway, which was good. we'll possibly skip this place next time. oh, beer was overpriced as well."
235,"Things I like about Jupiter - Nice outside area when fire is raging and a good jazz band is playing. Close to BART. Good service funky Berkeleyite type waitresses. Things I dont like about Jupiter -Their beer sucks. Its not quite about the beer, not quite about the music, and not quite about the food. It does all three half assedOverall - good place for a quick beer before hopping on BART or to meet someone unfamiliar with the area. Everything else is barely passable."
236,"why does this place have 4 stars?the beer is ""meh"" and its sooo crowded... an uninspiring place to spend an evening."
237,"It looked appealing enough. The guy checking IDs at the front said if we went around back our little dogs ought to be able to stay with us at one of the outdoor tables. So we walk around, and there's a bouncer and a middle manager sending us mixed messages. The bouncer is saying no way about my furry kids and the middle manager is saying it's okay- but that if his boss comes around and we're in the middle of our food, we'll very likely get booted. And that we need to find ourselves a table, which amounts to cleaning off leaves and drying chairs off.  I then get the speech about liability, and how there would be ""big problems"" if anyone got bit. I deal with passive aggressive people a lot- but even this schtick proved to me too much for me. Can my furry kids sleep at my feet or not? In the end I decided it wasn't worth the drama, and left with my posse- to which the middle manager went ""awww."" Because my furry kids (who would never bite anyone) are undeniably adorable AND he just lost what would've easily been a hundred dollar tab. If I had gotten a straight up ""NO"" this wouldn't have warranted a yelp review, but the whole ordeal wasted precious minutes with friends when I quite literally had a plane to catch. And regardless of whether with or without canine companions- y'all are supposed to be the ones to find/clean off a table!"
238,The food is actually decent but the service is just awful. If you don't order a drink with your meal the wait staff just gives you the shaft big time. I have had this on repeat occasions so I don't think it is a fluke. I know other people feel the same as well. I just don't like the attitude in this place.
239,"Jupiter always impresses me by how dissapointed I am when I go there.  The food almost always takes just long enough to annoy, and often longer.  If you go at an off-time, you can manage to sit outside, but if it's busy you end up sitting inside where there is a pervasive, rank smell (perhaps they need new mops?).  I stick to ciders, and although they have an interesting-sounding array of ciders--apple, pear, pomegranite, cherry, even sometimes lime--they are either too sweet, don't taste like the fruit they are made from, or taste too much of citric acid/vitamin c tablets.  The pizzas are what they are, gourmet-sounding, but ultimately dry and boring.  The only item I ever enjoy there is the Atlas sandwich, with grilled chicken and aioli on foccacia.  I used to have to dash down the hill to get there by 6 when they stopped serving sandwiches, but now they are only served until the mid-afternoon, effectively removing any inclination of eating at Jupiter anymore.  Also, if you ask if they have desserts, you are directed to Mrs. Field's cookies next door or Ben and Jerry's through the back alley.  The only redeeming factors for Jupiter are the large patio, the seemingly 'upscale' atmosphere, and a clear view of the bus stop so you won't miss your ride home.Two star? The beer is ok."
240,"So I've been to Jupiter a fair number of times, and have gotten a consistently worse experience each time I come here. The last time I came here, unfortunately,was the last straw and I doubt I'll go here again anytime soon. My boyfriend and I had to wait at 45 minutes for a table, and were then informed that the ""really small"" oven was backed up and pizza's would take 45-an hour to make. Okay, not a big deal, we figured it would take a while because of how busy it was. When we finally got our pizza 45 minutes later, it was undercooked. I'm talking, doughy, floppy can-taste-the-flour-and-yeast undercooked. We had to ask for a box right away so we could take it home and actually fully cook it. Our waitress was amazing and comped us free beer, but it still sucked to wait almost 2 hours for horribly undercooked pizza. It sucks, because their pizza is really good and their selection of beers is amazing, but they are horribly understaffed and they need to accommodate their staff with busier weekend nights. Also, their outside seating is first-come-first-serve, so be warned that during the weekend nights it can be pretty gladiator-esque for seating. If you have lots of time to kill, or come here during off-hours, I would recommend Jupiter. But if you're looking for a pizza-and-beer place to go to during the weekends, I would go somewhere else."
