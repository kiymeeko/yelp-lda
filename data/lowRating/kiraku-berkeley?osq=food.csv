0,"Truly one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. First they ran out of Sapporo, secondly they ran out of RICE (how?), lastly they tried telling us there was a $15 charge per person- there were 3 of us and our bill was $28 because everything we ordered had rice and we weren't able to order half our appetizers or any of our entrees. Oh and the octopus appetizer we ordered was disgusting. My boyfriend actually choked and spit it out in a napkin. Service was incredibly rude and I will never come back."
1,We had a 7pm mid-week reservation. They obviously don't actually reserve tables because they told us there were three other parties before us (but only after we waited for 10 minutes first).
2,"Came here for the 4.5 star rating, but I think it's definitely overrated.The only good food I had here was the salmon sashimi and corn tempura.Most stuff were around average, grilled cod was okShrimp tempura and grilled squid were bad."
3,"I have no idea how this is such a high rated place. The two stars is for the friendly staff and the green tea ice cream. Otherwise i spent $90 (including tip) for two of us to eat, hated all the dishes and left hungry. I even did my research on Yelp and read reviews on what to order and maybe it's our palate but nothing that was recommended was good. We got the fried corn cakes, spicy tuna tartar, salmon sashimi (only solid food I ate and liked, nothing out of this world though), pork belly ramen, fried chicken nuggets, rock shrimp and green tea ice cream. All of it was either too greasy or flavorless, minus the salmon sashimi and green tea ice cream. I'm glad I tried this place as it has high ratings but I won't be coming back. Street parking is available."
4,"First time here. Let me just say that I am not a fan of Japanese food; however, my family loves it. So often times,  I follow them to whatever restaurant they go to. Whenever I do go to a Japanese restaurant, I usually only order all the cooked stuff for myself. The stars is solely based on my udon and the udon only. Everything else besides my udon, my family says it's good."
5,"This review is for customer service only. This place is very pretentious. I walked at 5:25pm, 5 min. before they open. I went to use the bathroom. Afterward I sat at one of a single tables near the window. The place was still empty, only me. The staff asked me to get up and go sit at the waiting area near the entrance on the cold day and the door was wide open. I looked at my phone it was 5:28pm, 2 min. before open. They insisted me to wait at the waiting area for 2 min. I should have left, but I was hungry so I waited out. The staffs were UNFRIENDLY, no smile and only interested to get you in and out as fast as they can have more turn over. Not sure if this is Japanese culture, but this is America."
6,"Sushi was alright, I've had better but I've had worse . I ordered a bowl with yellow tail that has rice and crab meat etc and there was a funky smell in the bowl which is a big turn off for sushi obviously. But the rolls were alright and edible."
7,"Don't bother coming here. The food is mediocre and NOT worth it. Ramen scarcely had anything in it; skimped on noodles, had 1 small bamboo sliver, oily greasy soup base. Meat skewer was blah. TERRIBLE,  terrible service! We weren't even there for 45 minutes and the waitress kept being pushy to get us out of the restaurant. Ultimately she told us she needed the table because people were waiting. We had only been there for 1 hour. Shocked at how rude she was. Never coming back."
8,"I agree with the other negative reviews.The sashimi was just ok, everything else was subpar.The food quality has gone down. We were disappointed that we had spent $110 dollars and of that $34 was for average quality and small portion of sashimi. The karage was way too saltyand tasted like it had been microwaved. It was chewy and way TOO hot. Chicken can't be that hot and chewy unless you microwave it.Oh and the food took forever to get served to us.The reason why we had gone often in the past 2 years is because it was very fresh on authentic Japanese food. But recently I don't think it is any different for all the rest of the Japanese restaurants in the East Bay.It seems that they are just too busy and don't seem to care about the quality of their food anymore. I suppose they just make their profits from the sake which the customers seem to enjoy. Another issue with Kiraku are the tables. Some couples who don't order any alcohol get a 4 top while others who want to spend money and have a reservation get wedged into a 2 top. It doesn't seem like they care about seating because they are popular. If they served good quality food and better services, we (2 people) could have spent more than $110 we spent that night (usually, we spend around $150+)However, we just decided to leave early even though we were still hungry. Overall, the quality of the food and the service was poor."
9,"Over rated.Food was decent enough but not good enough for the prices charged.DONT GET ANY SUSHI... I'm admit I am a sushi snob, but they served a 35$ 5 piece sashimi special that was clearly just old fish. Not the worst, but I'm just saying stick to the grilled and fried things. Textures were all wrong on the various fish too, indicating their age and mishandling.Best dish for me was the fried chicken cartilage ""nankotsu karaage""Service was pretty bad too. Sent back a sake but they didn't remove it from the bill. They try to get a Japanese thing going with the whole ""irashaimasen"" but they fall short so should probably just give it up. Overall the servers seemed pretty stressed and untalented... Which is no bueno :(All in all I'd say this place lacks the passion it needs to be awesome. Decor is good btw, so decent for dates, but it is in a sketchy part of telegraph, so keep that in mind.Ippuku still reigns supreme with kirala comming in a close but honestly terrible second."
10,"Most people will probably hate me for giving them only 2 stars, but when you read the entire review...you will understand why.My younger sister & I showed up on a Friday evening--July 10th, to be exact.  We got there around 6:45 and waited 2 hours to get a table & I'm not exaggerating on the wait time.We were already seated at a table for 4, and a group of 4 people came in after us so they asked us to move to a smaller table, which a couple had just left, and we were kind enough to do so.We ordered a few items:1) Suzuki carpaccio - light and flavorful, very tasty2) Whole squid - simple, yet still flavorful3) Pork belly kakuni - simply delicious!4) Duck breast - under cooked so it was a little tough5) Beef tongue with truffle oil - too rare, weird after taste because of too much truffle oil?All I have to say is that the food was good & the service was also good, but why the 2 stars, you say?Well, I went home and got really sick.  I was throwing up all night and I knew exactly what caused it too.  It was the beef tongue.  If not handled or cooked correctly, it will cause you to get sick because the tongue carries a lot of bacteria.  My sister got lucky because it was the only item that she didn't eat.  Lucky me!!"
11,"I've had a love affair with Kiraku for as long as I can remember. The place was charming, the food was creatively delicious without being too edgy, the portions were fair, and the service was great (I tipped 25-30% every time I go). I would go here for special occasions such as dates, birthdays, or to treat myself. However, I vowed to never return after one sour incident. I wanted to make a reservation for my birthday, so I called to see if I could book a slot. The girl who picked up my call informed me that the minimum order for reservation is $40 per person. Hmmm I thought...it used to be $30, then $35, now it's $40. And on top of that, she said, we would have to order drinks, so realistically it was $50 per person. Ok, that's fine. So then, she also told me that reservation meal is now pre-fixed only, meaning that the $40 would pay only for a menu that the chef has planned for us and we would be able to order the a la carte menu separately. That's fine. But then I asked her approximately how many dishes would be in the pre-fix as I wanted to explain to my guess how much $40 worth of food would be. It was very apparent that the girl on the phone was very confused by my question and  rudely said ""sir, we only take reservation for people who are familiar with OUR restaurant's style of food . To which I said ""well, I am very familiar with ikazaya & have actually have been a regular customer for 3 years"" & said my goodbye. No thanks, Kiraku. The more popular you get, the more ridiculous your requirements get. I'll take my mouth & wallet elsewhere."
12,Place is too busy. Wait time over an hour for 2 ppl. It's Freezing cold outside and hostess kicked everyone out to huddle under a small propane heater with blustery winter wind. They should do phone call/txt alerts so ppl don't have to die of hypothermia to get some soup.
13,"We arrived 6:15 pm. The waitress asked us if we can finish our dinner by 7:15 pm since tables were reserved for other parties (they only take reservation if whole party spend at least $30/person). We said ok and hastily finish our dinner. The restaurant was still half full when we left by 7:15 pm sharp. One of other waitress told us, ""Sorry that we made you rush!"" WTF! Did somebody lie to us in order to empty the table quickly??? If so, this is horrible business mind set!"
14,"Poor service.  Staff do not answer phone calls.  I left a message for a reservation two nights prior to the reservation date, but did not receive a call back until 30 min prior to the requested time."
15,They put the sign in sheet outside. when they have seats they even not go out to see the list...we let people behind us in...you know the waiting time...It's made me so angry
16,"I usually tip Japanese restaurant very well. 15% at least, 25% if the food and service is good. However this is the only time I only gave 2 cents tip. I know this may piss them very much but honestly, I am pissed too.Following reasons for why:1. One of our orders never come2. They limited our dine time for 1 hour, while majority of the time we were facing an empty table.3. Appetizer came in the middle4. They accidentally broke a bottle of beer. The beer messed up my dress and broken glass almost cut my foot. Nothing but one ""I am so sorry"" after they cleaning up the mess, replacing the beer, and apologizing for the people sitting near us several times. 5. Last but not least, when I asked for bill, after all the inconvenience and our 1 hour dine time expired with still one order missing, they gave me a $0.99 Pocky, yes, the cheap snack from the convenience store nearby, as an apology! I feel insulted by this cheap apology! After such a bad experience, a free ice cream or some discount( by the way the bill for two of us is $72, and we run into the pho next door because my friend is still hungry!) will be appropriate and I will at least leave 15% for poor service. But come on, Pocky???? That is a service level that beyond poor. It is extraordinary! I just can't image anything cheaper than that. So, that's my two cents."
17,"If you are interested in having a reservation somewhere, this isn't the place. I started calling 8 days before date that I was trying to make a reservation. I missed the first call back and they wouldn't pick up when I called back (so I left message number two). They never responded to message number two. So a few days later I left message number three. Two days after that I got a return message asking me if I was aware of their minimum order policy. The same policy that I was forced to listen to every time I left a message. So yes, I'm well aware of the policy and had planned  to order much more than the minimum. So I call back again, leave my fourth message saying yes, I understand the policy, please call me back and confirm the reservation. The next call that I get is one saying sorry, we are already booked at that time, you can come at 8:30 instead. Clearly they had zero interest in my business as they knew for 8 days that I was trying to make a reservation and preferred to give the time away to someone else. Great service! I won't be wasting any time or money at this place. There are lots of restaurants out there with great food that actually want business and don't play games with reservations."
18,"I really enjoy this restaurant. However, their reservation policy discriminates against individuals who do not consume alcohol.  They won't give you a reservation unless everyone in your party orders alcoholic beverages.  There are many reasons, socially, religiously, legally and medically why an individual cannot or will not consume alcohol. I understand the concept of an izakya but if we exceed the minumum per person  ($30) to make a reservation, I don't understand a policy where we are forced to ""enjoy their alcoholic selection.""   What are the pregnant women, under-aged, recovering alcoholics, or people who simply make a life choice to not drink alcohol expected to do?"
19,"Do not go here! Made a reservation for 6 people, got here and was told that we had to leave in 1.5 hours. Which would have been fine if they had mentioned this when we made the reservation! We felt rushed and around the end of the 1.5 hours they were eager to push us out the door and reminded our table multiple times. Not only that. When we told them no one told us about the time limit,they were neither apologetic or surprised. They were more concerned about pushing their customers out the door. Poor service. Poor communication. Mediocre food. Avoid this place. There are so many choices for izakayas why waste your time here.Maybe management has changed?  Been here before never going back."
20,"Kiraku has great food but in terms of ambience, this place is a no-go. I came here with a friend for dinner and it was cramped and so noisy to the point where I had to shout to hold a conversation"
21,I was hoping to try their food unfortunately I did not get to experience it because the server sat a party of 4 first who came way after our party of 3. So what is the point of putting your name down on the waiting list??! Not cool Kiraku! I'm giving you 1 star  only because I can't continue this review if I don't put any star.
22,"They closed for a while last year.  We stopped coming to eat until tonight.  The wait is long..... Like 200 years....Outside of the restaurant. Dressed warm, bring your umbrella.  Fully charged your phone or tablets so you keep your mind off things.  The wait continues...... I am hungry bothering hangry.... I will wait but this is Probably our last time coming here unless they started taking reservations.  So sad."
23,"This is a review of their awful customer service. First time trying this restaurant and liked the good reviews from Yelp. I left a VM asking for a reservation, somebody just called me to advised me that because I was using their reservation system I had to expend thirty dollars per person ......what? Why if I don't liked the food I asked her, she said well we will give you a gift card WTF.., a gift card for what? For another restaurant? I guess the reason is because they are very small if that the case  don't do reservations...that's it! But this rule sucks and I never heard something like this. I will never ever eat there! Thank you for ruining my birthday celebration!"
24,"The two stars is for my experience from the other night. We came here for my friends birthday dinner and had reservations, but when we all got there, we were not able to be seated until a good thirty minutes later.I have to say that the food itself is very good, and left all of us full and satisfied. We ordered a lot of different options: corn tempura, salmon sashimi, chicken karage (one of my favorites), black cod, saba shio, and roasted duck...among so many others that I can't remember off the top of my head right now!Also for a place with not very many staff, the service was decent, and I never had to ask for my water glass to be refilled because they were always on top of it. For the most part, they were also very friendly and tried to be accommodating despite the initial wait.So why the two stars? I've definitely tried better izakaya style places in the area, like Ippuku which is not too far away from this location. We were also served dirty bowls, not just with like remnants of food that didn't get washed away, like a full bowl that just never got washed. Although they were apologetic about it, I just couldn't help but wonder about the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. We also had issues with paying. Since we wanted to split the bill, they didn't let us split with card and cash, so we had to pick one. They also don't take Amex."
25,"Worst communication on service ever- we didn't have reservations so we came early and put our names on the list. The waitress said the wait would be an hour so we walk around the area instead of standing in the cramped ""waiting"" area. When we come back in 45 min, they already crossed out name and told us we had to re-add our names to the end since we missed our time. Instead of other restaurants that seat you when the next table is available, they basically force you to stand around watching other people eat until they call your name. Usually I don't review based on service only but this is ridiculous and we would not return."
26,"We had the unfortunate pick of the SPECIAL OF THE DAY. Since being a special obviously no price listed on the menu. The issue that developed was that the data was not  offered by the server when describing the special, especially considering following conclusion of the story. Hind site I should have asked except I did not grow up in a forest. The dish was a 15 piece sashimi assortment. Socking surprise when we got the bill for the ONE DISH, $48 before tax and tip for 15 tiny pieces of fish and scallops, 3 of each.Again, the server did not warn us of the outrageous price specially when compared to an expected price range based on other similar items on the menu like an order of their 8 piece albacore tataki (one of our other orders) which was $12 and a more labor intensive dish. After asking about the steep premium (unfortunately already paid) they came up with the story of ""expensive components"". Yes, to be truthful there was 3 tiny pieces of tuna belly but the rest of the slices were salmon, tuna, scallops and mackerel. 3 tiny pieces each, all ordinary fish.We will never go back as I feel stupid and disturbed when trapped, CHEATED, suckered in.... :((((( .... on my Bday !!!!!"
27,"Arrived @ 6pm to sign on wait list.  Told to expect an hour.  Then out of the blue 2 reservations cut, hostess told me to be next, but another reservation cut in.  8:30pm still waiting.  Terrible service"
28,"If you're looking for interesting Japanese - Izakaya style - in Berkeley and trying to decide between Kiraku and Ippuku, go to Ippuku. I'd been to Ippuku and loved it, but chose Kiraku for dinner recently hoping to strike gold twice. Kiraku, sadly, was a let down for me.Our server was self-admittedly spacey and continued to prove this throughout the meal with forgotten dishes, dropped glasses and a seriously long wait for the bill despite repeated requests.When we both ordered the yuzu chicken udon (it was a cold, rainy night) our server told us the chef doesn't like this (people ordering the same dish at the same table) but ended up letting us do it anyway. Uhhhhhhh....? I found the soup rather bland and the chicken extremely fatty. I love Japanese soups but this one just didn't deliver.The famed corn tempura was yummy as tempura typically is, but I'd likely not want more than a piece and you get four or five per order. The standout at Kiraku for me was the homemade grapefruit yogurt ice cream. It's the only thing I sampled here worthy of a repeat visit. But I doubt I'll be making one."
29,"I went to Kiraku last night for a going away dinner and ended with mild food poisoning. The cause of this is because harmful bacteria or toxins were present in the food I was served. Although I love Kiraku, I will not be coming back. The food was great and delicious but the aftermath was not. We had the Shime, the ceviche, beef skewers and pork belly.Please be careful with what you eat!"
30,"Experience was horrible. We got there at 8.30 and waited 30 mins for sitting. After we finally got our sit people who were sit to ng next to us was way too loud and they even started to screaming but the waitresses didn't do anything when all the customers were annoyed and angry later we noticed that one of the waiter was friends with them, plus they charged us extra 12 for reasons unknown we had really high hopes for this place but it ended up to be nothing but crap"
31,"No clue how this eatery has such good reviews.The food was totally meh. We got the sashimi (not tasty) and 4-5 other dishes. All 3 of us were completely unimpressed. Also, the wait is super long. I'd skip this place."
32,"The food is okay, not awesome, not really worth the price but still acceptable. However, I didn't like the fact that the waitress chased after us on the street to request for tip. Yes we did not tip because we thought that the food was overpriced and the food took a little long to be served. But it's just bad to run after us to request for tip."
33,"Bleck! This was possibly the most expensive and worst meal experience I've ever had. I was very disappointed with the service, which didn't seem to know what vegetarian options there were or could be. The menu doesn't serve us much either. WIth as much business as they do, I suppose they don't need us (vegetarians), which is how I felt. I sat, and sat, and sat, waiting for something to come that I could eat. Others ate and were satisfied. I'm sure of that, but even when my glass was down and removed from the table, I didn't get any kind of replacement drink offered for quite some time. What sucks most about this place was the cost, when you consider I had to go across the street to get a burrito at the 7-eleven to get any real protein and satisfy my appetite."
34,"Well, the service was very nice.  But the food... Strange at best: fermented squid ... Looked and tasted like snot.  And the wasabi octopus, looked and tasted slimy and disgusting.  Salmon didn't taste particularly fresh.  Corn ""fritter"" was tasty as was the ""seared"" (not really) tuna.  My GF has peach sake and I had Apple sake... Highlights of the meal. On balance, very strange food. And I am experimental with food."
35,"Overpriced, long wait to get seated, even longer wait for food. Cold would sweep in every time someone opened the door."
36,"I gave one star not for the food, but for the service.I went with my family for an early Mother's Day dinner.  I was so sad that we didn't eat there because all of their tables for 2nd seating were reserved (for people who spend $30+drinks, we would've ordered the same amount but we have two underage children).  But the waiter didn't tell us after we put our name down and waited for 30 min. and the wait would be another hour even though we were the next party.       It took us 1 1/2 hour to drive from SF to the restaurant because the Giant's game just ended and traffic to the Bay Bridge was stop and go.  Had the waiter told us that the wait would be long because of the reservation when we got there, we would've gone to other restaurant (there is another good one near by and they had tables earlier).  You can imagine how we felt after 1 1/2 hr. of driving + 1/2 hr. of waiting and then were told to wait for another hour to get a table. I was glad that we didn't let this experience affect our family time together and decided to try Norikonoko Japanese Restaurant next door.  We had the best curry rice and bento combo there.  The service was very nice.  There are so many great Japanese restaurants in SF, Berkeley, and the Bay Area.  I will forget about Kiraku."
37,waited 1 hr 30 minutes for mediocre food. Not really worth only one star but think this place has way too high of a score so sorry.
38,"Japanese Tapas (and NO sushi)... disappointing, over-priced, extremely small portion dishes. The restaurant is stuffy and the tables are way too close to each other; I almost felt like I was eating with the strangers on the table right next to me! Go somewhere else..."
39,"I am SOOOO confused as to why this place has such a good rating. So I have tried quite a few izakaya places and I usually enjoy myself. My friends and I are all for trying new places and I rely on Yelp a lot to decide on what to try. Which is why I was so thoroughly disappointed when I came to Kiraku.So here's the story. I came to Kiraku on Wednesday night with a bunch of friends. We came here after KBBQ and we're just going to come in for drinks and snacks. I didn't read the Yelp reviews first so I didn't realize there was a $12 minimum per person so that was our fault. And since there was 6 of us, they pretty much made a good $72 off us easy. So after we sat down, my friends and I went on to read the tips from Yelp on my iPhone and ordered our food. and that was when the disappointment began.it was quite busy for a wednesday night, I will give them that. But our drinks took almost 20 minutes (really, how hard can that be to give me a can of coke and a cup of ice? I was DD for the night so I didn't order any alcohol). Then we waited almost an HOUR just to START getting our food. We got the Corn tempura with green tea salt first which just perplexes me because we also ordered the buttered corn and that took a good 30 minutes to come out after the corn tempura. The corn tempura that everyone was raving about is basically just deep-fried corn doused with salt. The buttered corn was just canned corn thrown onto a cast-iron skillet, no butter included.We also ordered the Roasted tea Blanc Manger which may very well be the ONLY redeeming thing about this place. It was light and fluffy and definitely tasted pretty good. We ordered a few other items but nothing was actually worth mentioning. The last two items that came were the dessert obviously. But why it  came out almost an hour after the Roasted Tea Blanc was just confusing considering that was also a dessert. We ordered the Sweet Potato Brulee and the Green Tea Ice cream with Warabi Mochi. It took a good 20 minutes AFTER we were completely done with our food and drinks. It would have made sense if they didn't notice we were done but they had already cleared all our empty dishes from the table. What I'm trying to say is that the service the WHOLE night was just plain disappointing. Drinks took way too long. Food took even longer (and for canned corn thrown onto a cast-iron skillet...REALLY?!). Everyone else seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves here on Yelp so maybe we just happened to come at a really bad night. But all in all, I wasted a good 2 hours of my life sitting around waiting on nothing. Pretty sure I'll never come here again. There are better Izakaya places and with better service"
40,The only thing I liked was the fried corn. Nothing else has any flavor. For the wait I was expecting Bruma Superstar status I was greatly let down. Won't ever be returning.
41,"I had terrible experience here. I visited my friends at the restaurant and tried to talk with him for short period of time, and the waiter said I must leave because ""I have no reservation"" although there is room for me. Although this restaurant is expensive the attitude of the waiter is terrible. I went there often before but I'll never go there again."
42,"I decided to try this restaurant because of the reviews I saw on yelp. The waitress and service was great, and I wish I could say the same about the food. I'm very confused about how this place receives such high ratings. I was very disappointed by all of the items that I ordered - the only decent dish was the beef with apple sauce. We spent over $60 on food that we did not even enjoy. Perhaps my taste is too original for this restaurant, but I don't plan to try it again."
43,"this place is small and recommend making a reservation first. we went on a Sat and waited for 2 hours, still dont have a table. The worst part is the service, waiters only care about ppl at tables but they dont see ppl waiting. No one come over and let us know how long we have to wait and when we asked she says 30min but we dont see any chance of getting a table for 1h or so. Even ppl with reservations have to wait for 30min outside bc there is no waiting area in this place. Its just not the service a restaurant should have especially most Japanese restaurants have good service. Worst service ever encountered"
44,Epic fail. We walked in with half the restaurant empty. They had no idea how to greet us or figure out what to do... Never mind.
45,"The food was good. But there were 2 things that kind of annoyed me, and I don't know if I'd come back because of these..1. If you make a reservation, there's a $30 minimum order per person. I think that's a little too high. $20 would've been fine, but $30? AND in the middle of us eating, the waitress came up to us to order more to up the bill. We weren't done ordering (still waiting on one more person) so it just left a bad taste in my mouth.2. When we paid the bill it was cash + credit card. They took it, came back and said, we can only take one form of payment. Hmm, ok. It's not that hard..but I guess I've never worked in the restaurant industry to know much about how it all works.Maybe I'm being picky, and maybe I don't appreciate food enough to know that the great food here overrides all that. I still don't like these ""rules."""
46,"Went cause my brother was excited to try it. Highly reviewed by foodie friends and yelp. Told to order min 2 order of corn cakes/best thing on earth. They won't take reservations unless you eat min $30 per person and drink heavily (yes, the staff saids that). So, we went with high expectations. 3 empty tables, we were next in line. Waited 40 min. Went next door to vietnamese place to eat ...noodles and fish cake. Afterwards went back in line to wait some more. Finally get seated (3 tables were still empty). Order multiple orders of corn cakes and recommendations from friends and waitress. 10 dish total. turns out that japanese tapas are not small plates, but full size meals. So there's 3 of us with lots of food. But not good food. Corn cakes are tasteless balls of dough with corn. no flavor or seasoning. Everything else was the same. Really odd odd stuff. no flavor, but the place is packed. go figure. Maybe foodies know something that I don't know. The fish cake and noodles next door were a lot better. Potentially one of the worst food I've ever had. Maybe they were having an off nite. Don't know, but will not be going back. Oh, as we were leaving, another table had was also order multiple orders of corn cakes. I looked carefully thinking there might have been different kinds of corn cakes and we got the wrong kind, but it looked the same. Oh well."
