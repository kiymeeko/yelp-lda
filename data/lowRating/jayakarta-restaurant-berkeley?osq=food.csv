0,"No greeting when I stood at the door; walked to the front and had to ask if it's self seating and picked up a menu. Initially ordered the egg noodles with chicken then I cancelled and got the mixed skewers with a side of rice.In my opinion, neither the chicken nor the lamb had much flavour so had to use much of the hot sauce and peanut sauce to experience something. Perhaps the noodles would have been different?What bothered me the most was that considering I was sitting at the table right in front of the register (where the two guys and lady were standing), no one ever came to fill my water or to ask if I was good.All in all, for me this was a one-time-try."
1,"We have tried twice to eat here.  Both times, upon our arrival, we see a sign on the door that they're closed for a month.Do they take a lot of vacations, or do we have a knack for coming at the same time, once a year?"
2,"Food taste not bad, particularly if you are into spicy food, but the menu overall is overpriced. Moreover, both the service and sanitation are getting worse and it took quite a long time for our order to arrive even though more than half of the seats were unoccupied."
3,"I was so excited to try this cuisine. I was exploring Berkeley and I was extremely hungry. So I thought this would be great! But probably the worst dish I've ever tasted. The dish was called Oseng Oseng Tempe I believe. Do not order it. Waste of money! I would rather eat any fast food restaurant food than that dish. The dish was so oily, greasy, and tasted gross. I literally felt I was drinking oil. Almost had no flavour what so ever. I couldn't even finish half of the dish. Felt horrible for wasting my money on this. Ruined my appetite and my mood. The only plus was the lady was nice."
4,"Heed the warnings of us poor, lost souls who came during busy hours. We didn't read the other Yelp reviews and we paid for it.I went in a party of four on a packed Friday night. Everything went fine until we placed our order. Two dishes arrived relatively quickly. The third dish arrived maybe ten minutes after. The fourth?* 10 minutes pass *""Hey, do you know what the status of our fourth order is?""""Yes. It's done.""* 10 minutes pass *The other dishes are cold, but no one wants to start eating until the fourth dish arrives. I flag down the waiter again. He looks at our table, goes behind the counter, and hands us a drink. This isn't some conciliatory gesture though; this is a drink that we ordered and forgot about after waiting so long. The waiter assures me that he hasn't forgotten about our order.* 10 minutes pass *An employee watches our table, wondering why we're taking up important seats without eating anything. I look at him. He looks at me. I look at him. Something clicks. He goes back to the kitchen and angry yelling in a foreign tongue emits from the back.The last dish arrives about 30 minutes after the previous dish. At this point, the first two dishes have sat out so long that they've become sentient, cold-blooded things.Food was decent but overshadowed by the service. We then asked for the check. We try to split the check but are told that it's impossible because writing two checks takes too long and we've been in the restaurant too long already (???). Fine. We go up to pay and the cashier asks us what the check says because the handwriting is illegible. Someone in our party has an aneurysm.At least we got a good story out of it."
5,"We went here on a whim a couple weeks ago. Wished we didn't. I figured there might be some obvious delays in service since it was the weekend, peak hours, and they were packed, and sure enough, it took a while not just to get seated, but also to put in our order. ""Oh well,"" I thought. ""The food will make up for it.""My husband's order came cold (...yep), and by the time he'd eaten all he could stand to of it, it was apparent that my order had been completely forgotten, and that it wasn't coming at all. It was busy, remember, so waitstaff were rushing around and it was hard to get a hold of someone. In the end we just asked for the check, turned down the offer to get my order made (we'd already been there for like an hour), and then left. My husband said his order tasted okay, other than it being cold. So maybe, if the stars align, and the kitchen can get you your food, and do so in a timely manner, this is a decent place to eat at. I'm not too interested in finding out, though; won't be back."
6,"Food honestly was fine and would have given 3 stars for that. However, my sisters water cup arrived with a large purple lipstick mark on the rim. I was able to easily mark it off with my finger showing how fresh it was. I told the employee while ordering and he brushed it off while taking order and took away the cup without apologizing. Fine. We ordered mie goreng noodles and fried sweet chicken. Didn't compare to food in Indonesia but it suited the cravings.Waiter now brought another cup promptly which had white crust attached to inside of the rim so I stopped my sister from drinking it. It was clearly not properly washed. I had given up hopes of drinking water here.We have had food in a lot of street side places in Asia etc so as long as food was cooked, we figured it should kill off anything and be safe.  Needless to say, this is not the sort of thought process that should be happening with a restaurant in the US. Food was fine but just the thought of those cups makes the place unappetizing to think about so won't be coming back."
7,"Came here with a friend. We found a curly black hair in our soup (which was definitely not ours, as neither of our hair matches that description.) When we brought it to the attention of the waiter, we didn't get a single apology; he shrugged, smiled, and said ""What're you gonna do?"" We told him we wouldn't be back. When he brought the check, he said ""you don't have to pay. You also don't have to come back.""Very happy not to."
8,"When I first ate here(around 1 year ago), the food taste amazing. However, the food does not taste the same anymore, especially the mie tek tek. Service is bad here. Today lunch special is not served because there are a lot of people. However somebody who comes after me is able to get the lunch special after talking to the chef. It is such a shame that I have come to hate one of my favorite Indonesian food restaurant in SF bay area."
9,"So I'm a big fan of Malaysian/Singaporean food and especially murtabak and mee goreng. I had the murtabak with beef, it was such a disappointment, the beef was corn beef, egg inside too cooked and the dough was the crispy one used in spring rolls not the soft dough like in naan/paratha. Also it is traditionally served with a sauce, didn't come with this one. The price was very decent (around $5 for 2 pieces) but it's still deceiving not to get what you paid for.The nasi I took (#32) was with BBQ chicken, it was good but there was too much peanut sauce.Service was alright nothing to add 1 extra star though. Also important they say it's Halal! Which is also the reason why I went there.I won't come back as the food wasn't worth the trip to Berkley."
10,"This place is kinda over rated.... I believe I've tasted better laksa elsewhere.. Kinda disappointed when the hype isn't real.We ordered a few other things, but nothing stood out for being rated #1 :(. Yelp fail."
11,"I am Indonesian and today i brought my overseas friends to visit indonesian restaurant in berkeley because we are on our way to san francisco anyway. I went once here and turned out the service has gone from bad to the worst ever. I dont know where to start. I ordered mie tek-tek spicy level 3 and i got the one that was not spicy at all. When i complained, they ignored it. Otak-otak only was only 4 pieces but he told me it was 5. I ordered nasi uduk but i got jasmine rice with nothing. Everything I complained but they said I ordered it wrong. Wtf?! Is it my fault if your waiter wrote it wrong?! I complained and you didnt even care about it?!The worst indonesian restaurant ever. Will not ever come back and will never recommend it to anyone."
12,"This place has gone downhill since they changed owner. One day I called for pickup, this lady picked up the phone in a rude voice said ""what do you want?"" I was like ""oh, do you have this rice combo?"" She shout to the kitchen and asked the cook and hung up the phone. This place used to be one of my favorite place for lunch but not anymore!"
13,"So, it seems like the reviews for this restaurant is pretty consistent as far as its really really bad service. I brought my friends here to introduce them to the awesome and delicious Indo food. Upon arriving, I was asking for a high chair and one of the servers pointed at the highchair to me. I thought, ok cool, he acknowledged that I need it. Minutes later, another party came and asked for a highchair as well. Another server grabbed the same highchair that was pointed to me earlier. Then I realized that the restaurant only have one highchair. So I asked,""Do you have another one? because I asked for it earlier and we came first."" The other server replied from behind the counter ""I pointed it to you."" Shocked I asked,""So...you were pointing it to me earlier to get it myself??"" he just remained silent and not even say anything...Any other day, I would've walked out and not give them their business. But because it was my friends' first time, I didn't want to let it ruin our lunch. Food was good. But I've had better. Service DEFINITELY left some bad taste. Not sure if I'll be back. Super disappointed with how poorly their restaurant service is."
14,"My boyfriend have walked by this place like everyday for the past three months and we finally had the time to go check out the amazing smell/aromas that would flow out of their windows. We came in pretty late, around 9? There were people there, mostly college students put with friends for late dinner. We ordered the mie tek tek (waiter's recommendation) and a chicken skewer plate dish. Noodle came out greasy and glorious. It tasted really sweet and and oily and MSG-y and all that good stuff. It was meh for the price. The chicken portion was a little small, but not too bad. Maybe we didn't order all the right things, according to Yelp highlights lol. We ordered what was recommended, although I really should have followed my heart and ordered a curry, maybe that would have been better. Bottom line: quick Indonesian food; awesome flavor but can be greasy; nothing that blew my mind; left feeling underwhelmed and money not well spent lol. I think college kids eat here before/after they party?"
15,"Checks Yelp for restaurants to try. Looks promising, I might as well give it a try. Everyone mentions that the food is great, but nobody mentions about the service here. Ordered: Nasi Goreng, Siomay Bandung (Fish Dumplings), &Mie Tek-tek. Food: Great flavor, aromatic, and great umami flavor. My favorite was the Mie Tek-tek because of the fried egg, spices, and nutty flavor. Service: This is the part that needs to be talked about. I've been waiting here for 30 minutes or more for dinner time at 6:30p.m. I noticed that none of the employees were checking the waiting list. Guests had to seat themselves. This is chaotic. Nobody is keeping track of who has been seated or crossing off names.I noticed two college girls(assuming since they are wearing college sweaters) came in, put their names down on the list, stand in front, and was quickly seated by an employee. This doesn't add up due to the fact that there were other people ahead of them with the same party size. Again this goes back to COMPLETELY ignoring the waiting list. What's the point of the waiting list if nobody is even LOOKING at it?!Also to mention that they forgot three of our drinks. Come on, this should be the simplest task to charge customers to get a profit off of. Overall: I would love to give this place a three-four stars, but from the lack of service. I'm sticking to two stars."
16,"didn't like the food and service.  food was nothing special.  service... hmm.. they don't really care about clean hands,  etc. one of the servers had a greasy ugly rubber glove on her hand and she brought plates out with that hand.  yuk. won't come back."
17,"My friends and I decided to try to be adventurous and try a restaurant that we haven't had in Berkeley.  Service definitely wasn't the best.  It took us a long time to order our food, and the waiters seemed to be glued to the front counter.  When we asked for recommendations, the waiter also seemed confused and did not know what to recommend--not a good sign.  I also had to actively try to get the waiters' attention for water refills.  Also, the time between our dishes was so long that we finished each dish before the other arrived.  The Mie Goreng was pretty good.  However, the table next to us had the Mie Tek Tek WITH AN EGG ON TOP.  We were eyeing their food the whole time.  My other friends also suggested the Mie Tek Tek.  I will definitely get that next time.  Ikan Goreng Asam Manis, which is deep fried whole fish in a spicy tomato sauce.  We got the Pompano fish, but there was very little meat and the fish was a bit dry.  I would suggest opting for the Tilapia instead.  On the menu, it said that this dish was ""spicy for Americans but not for Indonesians.  This is so true.  My American friend said it was spicy, while my other friend and I did not taste any spiciness.    Sweet and Sour Fried Chicken had a weird texture.  The chicken was so fried that it was difficult to taste the sauce when eating it.  Finally, after dinner, my friend and I noticed that we smelled so much like fried food that we had to shower when we got back home.  Definitely try to avoid this place if you don't plan on going home to shower after and if you're taking someone on a date.  Overall, I don't know if I'd go back because I wasn't impressed with the food or service.   But if I do choose to go back, I'd definitely try the Mie Tek Tek."
18,"Look, if you're a college student and want a break from ramen,  then I get it.  This place is a gem.   But if you're a functioning adult with even an average palate, here we go:  the roti was from Ranch 99.  The curry was watered down and probably from a packet.  The chili sauce on the fish was also from Ranch 99.   The yellow curry was decent.   Will never go back hence 1 star.   If you have said palate, Angelines lousiana kitchen.  Best Indonesian in Oakland?   Pshhhh."
19,"I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered... it was a YELP pick on the menu... but it was noodles with chicken, and a broth came on the side in a small bowl.  The description on the menu sounded delicious (chicken in garlic? and noodles), but the reality was BLAND.  Really, no taste.  Thai Iced tea was nice.  Place seemed kind of dirty, tired, worn.  I see no reason to go back."
20,We've been going here for years. It's changed for the worse. Even though the website showed they still did the lunch specials the server refused to offer it. He said it's too difficult. The restaurant was empty when we went in with the exception of one other couple. It used to be full at lunch time. The portions were much smaller. Won't be returning. It was different staff than used to be there so maybe it's changed hands. Oh well
21,"Having lived in Singapore for 6 years I was excited that we found this place that serves Ayam Penyet and satay. How disappointed was I when the chicken satay came and tasted like grilled chicken with jiffy peanut butter melted on top. Where was the ketupat and sliced onion??? The Ayam Penyet tasted like deep fried chicken and the lemon ice tea tasted like watered down tea. We left unsatisfied, had a after taste"
22,"BLUH! Bland, and not a good meal when you're sitting close to the kitchen and constantly swatting flies away from your food! Also I farted my fuggin brains out after this meal! Gluten free my ass! Literally!"
23,"Mie Tek Tek Stir Fried - False advertisement with their 2 chili peppers on the menu because it was not spicy at all. Instead, it was super sweet, soggy noodles, and cooked with leftovers chicken carcasses. Only thing that was truly edible was the hard-over egg NOT runny as stated on their menu. Roti Prata - The roti itself not bad, but too bad the curry dipping sauce was bland. Lumpia Semarang  - Not bad by itself and the dipping sauce looked unappetizing.Because I'm a true FOODIE and with their countless menu items, I'm interested to try AGAIN giving them the benefit of the doubt to rerate.  I laugh the next rating drops to 1 star. lol"
24,"Really wanted to like this place... service was pretty bad. And I was really looking forward to ""the runny egg"" on one of the noodle plates, as their menu describes... not a single run :( completely fried through."
25,"Ok, here's the thing. Clearly from the Staff's yelp responses to customers unsatisfied with poor service, Jayakarta simply doesn't care about it. They might as well be saying, ""boo hoo, cry me a river.""  Before I get sniped by the staff's response, I'll go ahead and do it for them ahead of time.- Jayakarta is NOT there to provide good service. They don't have enough staff; they're only there to serve the best tasting Indonesian food their head chef can whip up. - Full house, presidential patronage are all testaments that they are indeed cooking up pretty damn tasty Indonesian food. OK, fair enough. Look, if you are a regular here, Indonesian, Asian and ONLY care about what is on your plate, by all means please, Jayakarta is your watering hole. Great. You are their target market. BUT  if you're unfamiliar with Indonesian food, want to try it for the first time, NOT Indonesian, or Asian but kind of not used to the tough, supposedly alleyways of Jakarta style service, AND put value of your dollar bills on food AND SERVICE, DO NOT COME HERE. Or if you do come here, order to go and run out of there as fast as you can. If you DO want to experience the chaos here through dining, please, do not feel bad to leave little to no tip. That is of course if you get a horrible service. If you do get a nice server who won't yell at you, then by all means, tip away. According to the staff's yelp responses, they do not value service. That's not part of their value proposition. When I pay to eat out, I'm paying for FOOD and SERVICE. They say they style themselves as a fast food restaurant.. OK, well I don't pay tip at a fast food restaurant and even at fast food restaurants I get water when I ask for it. If you want to be a fast food restaurant, why bother styling yourself after a DINE-IN restaurant?  You can't ask for the customers to expect ""fast food chain"" level service, then expect a real restaurant level mark-ups. (come on, let's be real, we all know that plate of fried rice is not worth 12 bucks. )  Obviously you can't have best of both worlds can you? Clearly, the staffers at Jayakarta do not feel bad about yelling at you, not serving you water, then you, dear fellow restaurant patrons, should NOT feel bad about not tipping. Lastly, here is what happened my 3rd and last time setting foot in Jayakarta, before I edited in the additions up there. Don't sit at a table that isn't wiped.. apparently even if the waiter says its OK to. Otherwise a mean looking sweaty man from the kitchen will stomp out and yell at you rudely. Even if we did something ""wrong"" he really shouldn't be yelling at  customers. If he had nicely asked us, I wouldve apologised and stood up. I came to yelp to write a really scathing review about the service and started read what Jayakarta's own staff writes about it. And decided to edit out my snarky complaints because well, as I said above, I'll just end up crying them a river. They don't care. Really, THEY DON""T CARE. They even said, TIP APPROPRIATELY ... hm. A truly odd and unique business model."
26,The food was decent the only thing I would say is I wish they would clean the place up a bit.The carpet was dirty and everything just seemed a little greasy and that always makes me nervous..yikes! Sorry!
27,"I had such high hopes for this place, but my one-word review after dining here for lunch would have to be: PaaassAllow me to elaborate with more words. The food is decent, but far from being as good as the ridiculously delicious Indo-Malaysian food I've enjoyed in Toronto, New York and other cities. The portions are on the smaller side (even for lunch), and the flavors are all very diluted and have a ""watered-down"" feel. I'm not sure why.I got the Kari Ayam and Sambal Goreng Hati Ampla. The Kari Ayam was the better of the two, but the sauce was very watery and the potatoes were barely cooked (though the chicken was quite moist and tender). The Sambal Goreng is not something I would recommend for the less adventurous (it's essentially chicken gizzards and ""stinky"" beans in a slightly spicy sauce). The gizzards were done well, but again I found the sauce to be slightly off. A little too bitter, not savory enough.I also tried my friend's Mie Tek Tek. She stressed that she wanted it to be as spicy as possible. Either the guy didn't hear her or didn't believe her, because there was absolutely no spiciness at all. Spice FAIL. The ginger tea was also too ridiculously sweet for my taste (it was like drinking liquid crystallized ginger), but those who enjoy sugar in their tea would probably like this.The service is terrible and the reason why I never plan to come back. I get that Berkeley is a college town and the restaurants on Shattuck-University cater to a clientele that's probably 90% students, so I don't expect obsequious, Michelin-calibre service when I dine at places like this. I do however expect that a restaurant with a strict $15 minimum credit card policy will make change for $20 bills when it has plenty of cash to do so and when the people requesting the change (our party of 4) have ordered a ton of food and drink. The fact that our server literally stood there and refused to give us change--despite the fact that he was able to--left a bitter taste in my mouth that had nothing to do with the Sambal Goreng."
28,"Came here this afternoon and wasn't impressed.The appetizer page has a little blurb at the top that starts with ""These greasy appetizers..."" and boy are they greasy! We ordered the Perkedel, which are four deep-fried potato croquettes with veggies. They're smaller than I imagined they would be and glistening with grease. I wasn't a fan of these as they were too mushy and didn't pack enough flavor for me.Laksa Jakarta - The broth was too milky and didn't settle well with our stomachs. The potatoes in there were good though.The raved about Mie Tek-Tek didn't live up to its hype. It wasn't spicy at all (I found myself piling on the chili sauce) and the ""fried egg with runny yolk"" was more like a oddly fried egg with a broken, well-done yolk. The chicken was dry and the dish overall was way too oily. I could feel the oil on my lips every time I took a bite. Also, all the noodles were really short, as if they used the broken/old noodles to make this dish.With so many options in Berkeley, I'd rather go somewhere else."
29,"Bad decor, very run down. Food was average. Not  good. Just average. El teser drink was too sweet. Avocado in the drink did not taste good. Me tak tak was ok. Nothing special. Fried soy cake was very dry and starchy"
30,This is the second time I reviewed this restaurant. The reason I am giving 2 stars this time is because their air circulation is so badddddd. I can feel that I am breathing oily air into my body. Although they have open up their window and put a huge fan on top of their counter but that does not help at all. I really wish they could improve this so that I can come more often.
31,"The food was all right. Started with the grilled fish cake + peanut sauce (which seemed to be peanut butter, chili flakes, and rice vinegar), deep fried tempeh (aka temp-MEH), and shared an entree of vegetarian Mie Tek Tek. The Mie Tek Tek was basically chow mein with a lot of vegetables and a fried egg on top - people, it's not that life-changing. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be sour, but that tanginess plus the fact that the egg noodles were mushy made me think they'd just reheated some leftovers that had been in the fridge for 3 days.If I'd just had mediocre food, Jayakarta would still get 3 stars. But it gets two because I'm pretty sure stepping in the front door immediately increases your chances of emphysema by 50%. The restaurant was so thick with smoke that I was afraid to breathe deeply throughout my entire meal and I could literally see the air. And then I had to febreze every single item I wore to the restaurant because everything smelled like food."
32,"First bite of yummy noodles.....5 starsRealization that the food was on the greasy side.....4 starsStomach ache after dinner (probably not food poisoning; I am just extremely weaksauce when it comes to fatty foods)..... 3 stars Second time coming here: got moved to a different table 5 minutes after we were seated + stomach ache again after dinnerr....2 starsIn conclusion: tasty and unique Malaysian/Indonesian food, if you can tolerate greasiness and don't mind the mediocre service"
33,"Berkeley Food Crawl Stop #7: Mie Tek Tek and Roti PrataFood:+ Mie Tek Tek- based on the Yelp recommended list and reviews, we ordered the chicken mie tek tek, a fried noodle dish with a fried egg on top. talk about GREASE OVERLOAD. the noodles were slipping and sliding all over the place from the amounts of oil it was doused in. we got it medium spicy which was a good level for us, but the flavors didn't have a chance.+Roti Prata- also extremely oily and even the curry dipping sauce had a 2 inch rim of grease. If you're craving Indonesian food, I would recommend Borabadur in SF and get the mie tek tek and the gareng there.Service:Friendly and fast service. Ambience:The place was empty when we went on the Wednesday afternoon. They had nice Indonesian decor with the shadow puppets on the wall being my favorite.-Hungry Hungry Pongy"
34,"The food taste good for some peep who never had Indonesian food. However for the actual Indonesian person it's an OK taste. The price however it's expensive compare to other Asian food and they give you small amount of food per serving. I rather spend my money on other Asian food around Berkeley even though I was born in Indo, but yet I never miss these kind of food."
35,"It's unfortunate as I had high hopes for this place. The food is good. I had no problem with that. My problem was the dreadful customer service. It totally killed the experience for me and made it uncomfortable. Every time a waiter or waitress approached, we'd thank them for things and they'd grumpily slam the dishes on the table and walk off without saying a single word. Every time we asked for a new dish or drink the woman there would roll her eyes as if she was mad we were buying something else from them. I was shocked to see 4 stars for this place. A simple ""you're welcome"" or any words in response at all goes a long ways. Learn simple human contact. Are we not good enough for them to talk to or have good manners to? It's okay, my time here may prevent you from making the same mistake in coming here. Good food but very rude service. Also, fly's are everywhere around our table which gets annoying after a while."
36,"Went here with pretty high expectations based on a recommendation from an Indonesian friend and the reviews. What a LETDOWN!For one, we walked in around 11.45 and there was nobody there. I know some folks in the back saw us but there was no attempt to welcome us or seat us. Should have left then.Anyways, ended up seating ourselves and helping ourselves to the menus. A little while later, a waiter saunters over and takes our order. The food was just plain BAD. The chicken tasted funny. It tasted old and it did not help that we saw the chef use the microwave over and over while he was making our food.  Does not happen often but ended up wasting food. Oh, and this place needs some deep cleaning and more TLC. The music was a little odd and annoying as well. Again if the food was good, I probably wouldn't be nitpicking. BTW, until we left around 12.15 and still there was nobody else there. This area has tons of interesting restaurants and I regret wasting an opportunity on Jayakarta."
37,"Some of the best food I've eaten....and one of the WORST service experiences I've suffered through! I took my wife to Jayakarta tonight [12/06/15] as we love ethnic food. We got there before the restaurant was full, but it took forever to get our meal! When finished, we attempted to order dessert and get a ""to go"" box. Trying to get the attention of our server was useless....while the fellow behind the register was on his smartphone... Patrons came in after us, were served, paid and new patrons seated while we waited for a ""to go"" box and a simple dessert order. I stepped outside, and my wife made the request. Nothing. After another 10 minutes I finally walked up to our server and asked [again] for a box, and to forget the dessert if it was going to be any longer. She brought both in a few minutes.The food was great, but was overshadowed by terrible service and as smoke filled the restaurant, I had to leave twice to avoid an asthma episode! When my wife explained that I had to step out--and that they needed a fan in the kitchen, there was no apology. They just said, ""There is one in there"".Some notes to Jayakarta staff: 1. Be Prompt.  2. Be attentive.  3. Return to the table to check in with your guests. 4. Apologize when you are delayed.  5. Work as a team--cover for each other.  There never time to text when the restaurant is busy--especially not in the front of the house!  6. Comp a dessert when a diner is obviously upset with your service-as I was tonight. 7. Your ventilation system doesn't work. It's a health hazard. Fix it."
38,"I went here a couple weeks ago for dinner with my family. This place is horrible.. to put it mildly. I was about to enjoy my empek- empek when I noticed a black spot in my food. I thought it was a burnt piece, but to my horror, it was a huge dead fly!If that doesn't ruin your appetite, I don't know what will. We told the waiter but he took my plate away and denied it was a fly. He said it was a BEE and didn't even apologize. What's the difference between a fly and a bee when it's in your food??? Thank you but I won't be coming back. P.S be sure to check your food thoroughly because although the dim lighting creates a mood, finding a bug in your empek-empek kills it."
39,"5th visit over the last 6 years, food qlty deteriorated.Lunch menu: item 31 and 32 , nasi lemak Rice cold, chicken hard as rock, only Ikan billis edibleOtah - half cooked , I ordered well done guys! Chendol - please stop serving this , it does not serve Indonesian famous chendol justice Date last visited 16 June Friday"
40,"I called this restaurant around 7pm & asked what time they closed tonight ? The lady answered the phone & said ""we closed at 9pm"". So I drove there from San Francisco (fight the traffic) to get the pastry, I arrive 12 minutes before 9pm & gave them a call I about park my car, the lady answered the phone..said they closed already, nobody at restaurant. So Un-proffesional to treat customer, if you closed early then please tell me on the phone that will closed early that day, before 9pm, no matter what !!!"
41,I accidentally went to this restaurant and I totally regretted my decision. It is the one of the worst restaurant I have ever eaten near Berkeley. One of the vegetable fir is bitter and it should be a little bit sweet.
42,"We came on Tuesday night and it was busy, but we got seated immediately.  They never came back.We waited fifteen (15) minutes -- no water, no menus, no further acknowledgement.  A disconcerting observance: the staff seemed more intent on folding their arms with prideful smirks, amused with how busy their restaurant was.  We pointedly walked out.Perhaps I'll try again and update my review accordingly..."
43,"I rarely give restaurants a One star. This place was dirty! All the tables were sticky and did not look clean. Anyway, I stopped by for lunch and ordered their lunch special for $10.50 (beef Padang). The dish came with one tiny piece of meat and a hard boiled egg with tons of rice and tons of boiled cabbage. I asked about the quantity of meat, the waiter got annoyed with me. Awful! Do NOT recommend going there!"
44,"Jayakarta, I have erased you from my favorite restaurant.You have become way too overpriced and ironically you make portions smaller and less quality...your food have become less tasty and authentic.Will never go back to this place anymore..place is pretty strange and ugly..."
45,"Well, the service has always been curt, but it never got to me until a week ago. We went on a Saturday night and we left sorely disappointed. We asked that the squid dish be taken off our bill. The squid dish was AWFUL: squishy, mushy soft squid that tasted and smelled gross. Our usual mie tek tek was average, and the vegetable dish was mushy as well. Our hair and clothes smelled of cooked food and smoke (more so than usual). We we will not returning, sadly."
46,"FANTASTIC noodles.TERRIBLE bland curry.HORRIBLE service.They're terribly understaffed - only one waiter and one food-runner during a busy weekend dinner service.  We waited quite a while for a table, which was fine, but after being seated for 45 minutes, we still had not been approached by a waiter to take our food or drink orders.  I asked the waiter whether we could have our order taken (even just drinks!), and he said ""no, sorry, kitchen too busy - maybe we come take your order later"". So, we sat for over an hour without even drinks.  I understand that the kitchen was busy, but (1) they should not seat patrons they can't accommodate, and (2) they're losing out on A LOT of money by not at least taking drink orders while making patrons wait an hour to have their food orders taken. As above, the food was mixed. Some amazing, some really really not good at all. Would not be back."
47,"Didn't like it. Meat was firm, noodles were cold and not flavorful, the roti prata dipping sauce was too runny. No thanks."
48,Maybe I ordered the wrong dish but the I thought the food here wasn't that great.  I came for lunch or the lunch special where you get to chose two entrees.  It comes with a little salad that was overly dressed with a peanut dressing and rice for about $8.  I dont remember the names of what I ordered but one was a sweet bbq chicken which I thought was overly sweet and dry.  The other thing I ordered was a similar bbq beef which was like eating beef jerky. I walked out wanting more.  I really wanted to like this place but I dont think I'll be coming back.
49,"I came back here to get their 7.95 lunch combo. You get to choose 2 items, which comes with rice and your choice of soup/salad. Sounds like a good deal in theory but the food was woefully bad this time. I had the Rendang, beef slices that were very tough to chew and the deep fried soy bean cakes that were drenched in soy sauce. The jasmine rice was quite fragrant though."
50,"All the while I was having lunch at Jayakarta, I kept thinking about how much I miss Borobudur. I just don't get it! Am I missing something fundamental about Jayakarta? Experts, please school me on this.Frantically craving beef rendang and with the glittering yelp reviews at my arsenal, I thought Jayakarta would be a great home-base Indonesian haven. But the prevailing sense throughout my meal was a niggling feeling of uncleanliness, from the water-logged and soggy lettuce that sullied my otherwise flavorful gado-gado to my confusing rendang, which lacked the balance to showcase the complexity and range of the flavors to the point that it even revoked the exoticism of the dish. By far the worst part of the meal, however, was the vegetable soup that one of my dining companions opted for instead of the gado gado in the lunch special; the aftertaste reminded me of what PineSol smells like. By the end of the meal, I felt as if my mouth had sat through the janitorial service cleaning the unisex bathroom in my freshman dorm after an extended holiday weekend.Is it perverse that despite this experience I'd be down to try Jayakarta again upon the weakest of promises that it would be better next time? I am so desperate for good Indonesian food around these parts."
51,"Where to begin?  Everything was awful - not sure how it has gotten all the good reviews.  I'll start with the service which was horrible.  Very unfriendly, threw our check at us without even asking if we wanted dessert.  Inside the seats are torn and uncomfortable.  My mug of tea was sticky and dirty.  I'm glad I didn't see the inside of the kitchen.The food was bland, spinach was so overcooked it was slimy.  I could hear the constant use of a microwave which means they are reheating the food instead of actually cooking it.  As if all of this wasn't bad enough once I got home I spent the rest of the evening in the bathroom.  Isn't hard to imagine why given the dirty dishes and sloppy cooking of the food.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!"
52,Horrible service. Waiter is unresponsive and not nice. Can't take credit card. Not coming here again. No smile at all.
53,"Mediocre, unfriendly service with dishes arriving at varying times. Super-spicey, so order a milky cold drink. The noodle dishes are good (27, 28)."
54,"Its a simply designed place, no frills, but clean.  The food is ok. On weekends they offer tender meats and rice served in bright green banana leafs which are lovely.  The ginger tea was perfect on a foggy cool evening.  The aromatic Nasi Lemak was served with a sweet mix of crispy anchovies and peanuts along side cucumber slices.  Biting into a fried banana caused an eruption of grease to spew out the opposite side  drenching my plate in goo, so obviously I was not a fan of that.The service is a little, sparse.  I have been three time, sometimes they are busy but other times they are not.  No matter how many people they are servicing they are neglectful.  Water glasses go empty, food is not brought out, and bills are not sent to the table.  And to make matters worse, the waiter even pre-filled the tip amount on my credit card on someone else's authority.  Creepy and I would not go back."
55,"Food = excellent, Service = terribleThe food at this place is incredible, unique and full of flavor (One of the chicken dishes was full of bone shards, so watch out for that, but I'm willing to pass that off as part of this style of cooking). If I were judging it based on what they served alone, I'd give Jayakarta 4 or 5 stars.The service (our waiter was the guy on the right in photo #11), on the other hand, was appalling. With only 3 other tables beside ours occupied, I had to get up and ask for plates after our food had been served. Refill on water? After trying to get the waiter's attention for a good 5 or so minutes, I got up and poured myself a glass from the bus table as the waiter guy sneered at me from behind the register. He couldn't be distracted from texting on his cell phone to come check on us even once.The two other tables in the restaurant didn't receive much better service, but they did get refills and their check in a proper amount of time, and the waiter guy ran to one of the tables with a spoon when he noticed a child struggling with chopsticks. Several times throughout the meal, the waiter was clearing tables, or checking on people right next to us, but outright ignored our empty glasses (both water & beer). It seemed clear to both my partner and I that the only difference between us and the other patrons was the fact that we were a gay couple, and perhaps this explains why we were made to feel very unwelcome.I'd return here for the delicious food, albeit by take-out next time, if I weren't so offended."
56,"I must not get it.  I did enjoy the steamed fish cake in banana leaf, however I thought that the peanut sauce completely overwhelmed the flavor.  My shrimp curry was bland and flavorless and my boyfriend was not impressed with his meal which consisted of fried chicken, spicy beef, scrambled egg with green onion and fried anchovies.  The chicken was mostly bone.  Maybe we missed the hits since we aren't that familiar with Indonesian cuisine, but I don't think I'll be back..."
57,"Me: We've been waiting 25 minutes and he hasn't even acknowledged us or taken our order yet.  He could at least have brought us water or something. My BF: Jen look at him. He's running around sweating his ass off. Somebody probably took the night off and they got stuck short-staffed. Just be patient. We don't have anywhere to be anyway.Me: Fine I won't bother him, but don't tip him.My BF: Tip stands for ""To Insure Promptness"" so I won't tip him, alright? Me: I'm just hungry as hell, that's all.After an hour and fifteen minutes our food arrives and I'm so hungry everything tastes pretty good and portion size is generous, but we can't enjoy our meal because there are about 15 people in the doorway waiting to be seated and a couple of them staring at our food and watching us eat. It takes us only 30 mins to eat before we wanna get outta there. Check please! Hungry bellies are now full bellies. Me: (I see my bf grab the check) Eh whatever, just tip him.My BF: Actually, I was going to tip him regardless. These people work hard and it's not the greatest job. We just won't come back.Me: Word.They served us our food and never came back. I consider myself a patient person and hardly ever give 1 star reviews, but this restaurant almost got the best of me. Jayakarta is the most chaotic restaurant I've ever been to so if you're looking for a wild and crazy time, you'll get it. But it just ain't for us."
58,"I was disappointed when I came here.The otak was dry, disgusting.Mie tek tek was alright, not spicy enough.Number #69 (forgot the name) was way too sweet and now how it suppose to be.Not coming back here again."
59,"We were very disappointed by the service. We came for a dinner date. It was not very busy and we were pointed to the table. At first we were not greeted, and then after, the server was rushing us to order all our food (we were trying to get appetizers and then entrees). We asked for hot tea and rice three times (two reminders) and it was never brought to our table (although tables that walked in after us had plenty of steaming hot rice). We asked for the gado without shrimp chips on top, but when they brought it out, the shrimp was still there. The food came out very slowly and not in courses. We ended up eating separately in a way. It was very unorganized and I think they were more than ready to go home (hence the pushiness). Very disappointing, again, as we were trying to go on an enjoyable Saturday date. :("
60,Slow wait staff and slow food especislly since there was only one other table in there. Food wasnt worth the wait.
61,"I really was not a fan of this place for some reason.   Everything was just too dry for my taste.  Don't get the fried chicken, the spicy tender beef, or the eggplant because those are all things I tried... and I really hated it.The single thing I enjoyed most was the roti with yellow curry dipping sauce, but that was an after thought sort of appetizer that we decided to order.  My biggest problem with this place is their Gado Gado was drenched in a peanut sauce that was almost as thick as peanut butter.  I like peanut sauce as much as the next person, but please, I don't want my food to be overwhelmed by it!  I hear the noodles are good there, so if you must try it, then go for a noodle dish.  All the Indo customers seemed to be ordering that."
62,"Though I'm not Indonesian, I do dress like one.  Ok, well, maybe not, but I've devoured my fare share of home cooked Indonesian meals and Jayakarta was a disappointment.   Mie Tek Tek was greasy and pungent (too much shrimp paste?), and the Ayam Kalasan was edible, but nowhere near anything I'd consider delicious."
63,"Just awful! Both the quality and quantity of food to price ratio is horrendous. One small piece each for a mid-priced appetizer, and then fourth-reincarnation repurposed chicken fragments attached to old bones via hot glue gun slathered in uncreative sauce to pass for an authentic dish, and old carton fruit juice all watered down. And not even much of any of it. Then you really  have a struggle to get noticed to pay the friggin' bill anyway. On top of all that, the table placement is really claustraphobic.No good!"
64,"Last time I ate here, I found a blue rubber band in my food. Meh, herbs and vegetables are held together with blue rubber bands. This time, I found remnants of a sponge. That was enough to make me stop eating, since I originally wondered why my food tasted like dish soap.I like Jayakarta for its cuisine and family & friends atmosphere, but all bets are off when I've waited 20 hopeful minutes for dinner only to have the main ingredient be Dawn!!"
65,"We had Nasi Bangkus which came with a small piece of beef rendang (delicious and tender but slightly sweet and not spicy enough),  gudeg (jack fruit in interesting indescribable curry) and fried curry chicken (very small, not crispy) with rice in a banana leaf.  The portion of the items other than rice was small.Also tried Kari Sayuran (vegetable tofu curry) which was very salty but  lacking in spice or flavor.Cendol was all palm sugar syrupy (extremely sweet) and again had little in terms of taste (minimal coconut milk used).Much potentials unfulfilled."
66,"Had the nasi uduk jakarta.  teri kacanag was good, the beef was more sour than spicy, the chicken (supposed to be fried) one piece was fried and the other seemed curried.Not sure what to expect taste wise, but seemed not that flavorful.  I tried the mie tek tek as well, that had a better overall flavor.  As others have said, very mild spice.Not sure how the kitchen was setup, but for a bunch of duplicate orders, the arrival time of the food was odd.  Had to wait a long time (est 10-15 ish minutes) between first dish arrival and last dish.  Restaurant was not full at the time (est 10-20% occupancy)."
67,"We walked into an empty restaurant, that should have been a clue.The pictures and descriptions on menu make the food appear so appetizing yet the food looks nothing like pictures and tastes nothing like described.  AWFUL!!!!!!!I'm not quite sure where they got their chicken parts but not from any chicken I've ever seen. Who puts large pieces of grissle like meat on a plate?  I would like to hope that maybe I just ordered the wrong items, but I truly don't think so. Only 1 out of 6 items was edible and that was bread, you really can't mess up bread."
68,"I tried the rendang beef and the sticky rice. The beef was really, really dry and tough- to the point that the tasty sticky rice could not make up for it in this review."
69,"Probably better for dinner but not the best place for lunch. You're served a bento box of Indonesian food and the wait staff is a bit on the forgetful side. They neglected my companion's vegetable soup when he clearly specified he wanted that versus the salad and the wait staff got a tad bit riled when I asked where it was. Double hmph!! I've definitely had better Indonesian food experiences but, perhaps, I'm a bit bias because there are some great Indonesian restaurants in San Francisco that are probably worth the trek and the price. Had the BBQ chicken and tempe and I swear they purposefully forgot to put the Sweet Chili Sauce with my tempe. Grrrr! It's okay. Again, I'm willing to see what dinner is like but Jayakarta wouldn't be my first choice for Indonesian cuisine. There's got to be a killer place somewhere in the East Bay, I just know it..."
70,"It had all these printouts from yelp of people raving about the restaurant, so I went there. I ordered the dry spicy chicken which had the taste and texture of 7/11 beef jerky. I couldn't eat more than a few bites and left the place hungry. The service was cool and not very friendly. Maybe I just got unlucky with one dish but I won't be back."
71,"Worst food we've ever had, coupled with lousy service.  The waiter hardly said 2 words as he flung the menus on the table.  The lumpia appetizer was greasy and burned, and it had a 2 inch piece of chicken bone in it--i was lucky i didn't break a tooth!  The chicken dish my husband had was badly over-fried and covered in a soy-sauce based ugly brown fluid.  It was #64--(I can't recall the name of the dish).  And, my dish--#27--(again I can't recall the name but I had it with the very thin bihon rice noodles) was bland, greasy and had only 2 stingy shrimps, a few flat, unrecognizable items called beef balls, and salted shrimps (couldn't find too many of these either), and a few leaves of spinach  Worst, worst, worst food ever!  Will never go back."
72,"I really wanted to like this place more, if only because I would love to find a really great Singaporean or Indonesian place close by.  But I have to say, the nasi goreng did not taste like anything I had in Southeast Asia; come to think of it, nothing tasted the way I remembered it.  I might go back to see if the beef rendang is right, but I'm not in any hurry."
73,Food is ok..everything seems too greasy especially the duck fried rice.    Ventilation needs some improvement since inside is very stuffy.
74,"Lunch combo plate sounded good, but I ordered the chicken BBQ style and was presented with two small pieces, one of which was actually a chicken wing with basically no meat.  The other was part of a (small) thigh, with some meat but also gristle and lots of bone.  Flavor of the sauce was good, though.As you can choose two ""mains"" on this combo, I also ordered the yellow shrimp curry.  Very watery, and 2 (41-60 count) shrimp.Maybe dinner service is better...  I don't know;  Berkeley has lots of good places to go before taking another chance here."
75,"I have a fair number of indo friends and as much as I want to like this place, it's not good. For example, take the roti prata. I've never encountered a roti prata that I didn't like, but... this looked and tasted exactly like the roti prata I buy frozen from 99 ranch... round, oily, and a little soggy, not flaking into 100 pieces of crispy yet chewy deliciousness. I like my 99 ranch roti, but it's just not restaurant quality. Other dishes were ok (rendang), meh (chicken curry), or kinda gross (some fish dish and tripe dish). If you want to try tasty indo food, try Borobudur in SF.  Then you'll know why this place isn't good indo food."
76,"Their service sucks really bad. The last two times I've been there, I've tried ordering a coconut drink and both times they forgot it.The owner's or worker's family or some people they knew came in after us, took up a whole lot of space and got food way before us. I mean, I kind of understand that they are family but doesn't that mean they are more willing to wait? Man, at least go in order of who came first. I guess the only thing they got going was the food. Their one chicken dish, it has rice with coconut flakes on top and a peanut and dried fish thing, is delish-ush. Too bad I'm not going back =( It makes me super angry just thinking about their service"
77,"I just had the STRANGEST salad ever to pass through these lips. It was a odd warm slurry of lettuce, tofu, green beans, cucumber, daikon radish, shrimp chips, cabbage, and hard boiled egg, covered in a sweet, livery peanut goo. YUCK. Definitely not my cup of tea, or in this case, slurry.The rest of this meal could only get better, right?  I ordered chicken gizzards and stinky beans with chili sauce. You heard me right. STINKY BEANS. Usually, any ingredient which sounds that unappetizing turns out to be quite tasty. Take roquefort, for example. Not this time.2 stinky bean stars."
78,"Hum... Meat was dry, almost all the food we ordered had peanut in it. The place wasn't that clean. I wouldn' go back."
79,The newspapers gave this place 2 stars.Tend to agree.  it was fine but i added more hot sauce since the taste from the food was just passable.  The hot sauce tasted good tho!
80,"My boyfriend and I decided to drive from SF to Berkeley and dine at Jayakarta with 3 of our closest friends based upon word of mouth recommendation.    My girlfriend, who is of Indonesian descent, and her husband were perusing the menu with interest and were amazed at the NUMBER of selections listed on the menu.Unfortunately, the selection was all that was really working in favor of this restaurant on Saturday night.  The waitstaff, although friendly, was sluggish.  It took them over 20 minutes to take our drink and dinner orders.   After that, things rolled quickly downhill.  Only 4 of the 5 appetizers came out after an additional 20 minutes of waiting.  One main entree came out ahead of the last appetizer AND at least 15 minutes ahead of EVERYONE else's main entrees and the drink orders!  The food was more than adequately portioned, except for the rijsttafel (tasting menu), which was surprisingly not offered as small plates, but normal sized dinner platters. The appetizers that we ordered (satay and roti pratas)  were delicious, but we found that the sauces of the main entrees  (especially for my beef rendang) were overly sweetened.Overall, I was not left with a warm, fuzzy feeling after the meal.  My friends and I had to agree that if the service had been more attentive, that it might have been a salvageable dinner.  I am banking that this may be due to the fact that this restaurant recently opened.  Therefore, I may stop by again in a few months for another tasting, if they remain in service."
81,"I don't even remember what the food tasted like, because the service was terrible.The waiter seemed to deliberately overlook our table, and served some people who came in after us before finally taking our order.  Like a couple of other reviewers mentioned, each dish came staggered.  It makes it kind of awkward when one person has their dish, while the other two are waiting!Generally that sort of service is the kind of thing I overlook if the food is good - but the story gets worse.  One of my friends has a peanut allergy.  She orders a dish that is supposed to have peanuts on the side, and specifically tells the waiter (more than once) that she is allergic to peanuts (this isn't a preference thing!!).  The waiter jots down her order, but when she gets the dish, lo and behold: peanuts.Now it's one thing if the waiter says that the chef doesn't make any changes to dishes on request, but our waiter didn't tell my friend that at all: he just took her order.  Since she had been waiting so long for the food, she decided to just eat the main dish and not the side.  Turns out the main dish had peanuts in it too - luckily, my friend's reaction was mild and she had some Claritin on her!After the unfortunate meal, we asked for the check to be split.  Now I understand that sometimes this can be inconvenient for restaurants, but the server went and brought back three bills - and then SCOLDED the friend with the peanut allergy.  He practically yelled at her that next time, to pay with a card, you need a minimum $10 purchase (hers was something like nine dollars).  How rude is that?  If the restaurant requires a $10 purchase for card, the waiter could have told her politely so we could work it out (like combine her order with mine, or order dessert, whatever).  Instead, the waiter chose to yell at her.Bottom line: never going there again."
82,"So maybe I ordered all the wrong things, but the food here was NOTHING like the glorious stuff I had the pleasure of putting in my mouth back in Bali 10 years ago.  The noodles here were oily and coated with some weird peanuty sludge, everything had fried eggs or boiled eggs on it (which is ok, if you think 4 eggs a meal is a good amount), and service was quite slow.  The roti was DELICIOUS, and I would come back just to have that and one of the desserts.  But the entire dinner was really not very good, I had gerd after and didn't sleep well, and paid nearly $50 for that unique ""pleasure"".By the way, avoid the avocado juice at all costs.  I think the Yelpers that like it are food sadists.  It tastes like bland guacamole with ice in it.  Yech."
83,"Will update if I ever go again and pay in cash.  This place recieves two stars because the food was 4 but the service was one/zero.  The food was priced well and it was really really good.  Barbeque beef with cocunut based BBQ sauce was really good/cool. My companion's yellow curry was gigantic and filling.  Cocunut rice for a buck.  Pretty sweet right?Wrong...The service: How hard is it to refill water? really? Is that family of six people, most of them old and speaking Indonesian, really gonna tip you more/at all? Here's a hint: they won't.   Also, 10 minimum on credit, I understand, but if people want to go dutch don't be an asshole and say they can only use one card per table. When they are polite and say we'd be over the minimum it's this per card don't fucking roll your eyes and proceed to tack on extra charges like we don't notice.  If the food sucked I would have deducted from the bill."
84,A huge rusty nail 'hidden' inside my soup?? Me thinks not!
85,"I have never had Indonesian food before, but I still have an open mind to food. Out of our 6 dishes, none of us were impressed. My friends calamari was too way too salty.  And just the general flavoring and taste was not appetizing."
86,"note:  this review is coming from a vegetarian.(veggie) gado gado = very good.(veggie) nasi goreng = lots of it, but very lacking in flavor.(veggie) bakmi goreng = lots of it, but very lacking in flavor.so as a veggie, i'd not recommend this place to another veggie.  and go to borobudur or bamboo village in sf instead."
87,"this was the first time i've had indonesian-singaporean food.  the menu is extensive, there's a lot to order from which means there's also a lot to try and figure out if you're not familiar with the cuisine.i went with two other people and we decided to skip the rice plates and order family style to share.  we ended up getting:-roti prata as an appetizer - eh, nothing special, i buy the frozen ones from 99 ranch and heat them up at home, JUST AS GOOD.-lontong cap go meh - a yellow curry stew almost - i actually didn't eat much of it but everyone else thought it was the best thing we ordered- ayam goreng bumbu bali - fried chicken with a chili sauce (advertised as being extremely spicy - but wasn't even hot at all), there was so much batter on the eentsy weentsy pieces of meat - wouldn't recommend- we also ordered a beef dish (i can't find the name of it on the website's menu) - it was like eating beef jerky with sauce on it.... =/ the beef was so dry and chewy, we seriously thought they took packs of chinese style beef jerky and cooked it, totally wasn't what we expected it to be..all in all, i'd probably go back but i would try different things. i wasn't so much a fan of what we ordered this first time.  i definitely want to try some of their noodle dishes though - will keep you posted."
88,Not a good place for veggies.  Poor service. Food is very junky.  Would definitely not recommend for vegetarians and for people who havent tried Indonesian before.
89,"My friends and I headed over here after my friend read it on the SF Chronicle about this new Indonesian restaurant that opened up on University Ave in Berkeley since his wife is Indonesian, while I am the Malaysian Chinese food. So the two of us know Malaysian/Indonesian food well.The 5 of us got there fine, but then the series of problems started to happen.   It took us about 15 minutes to have the waitstaff to take our order for the food.  That was okay, we're giving them slack for being new and still trying to get things in order.  But then our waiting of the food is the thing that took another 20-25 mins.   In the meantime, we were all starving and they finally give us some chips to munch on.....that disappeared within 2 mins.    Then the rotis pratas (2.95) that we order came,  those came out great with its tasty soft texture and a great (NONSWEET) curry, but sadly to say that is only thing that was done right here.   Not everything came out with a flow from the kitchen, some of us got the food right away while some of the food took forever to come out.  My friend H main course came out faster than my friend's R satays and lumpias.  Then the whole load of food came out all at once, crowding the tables to plate overload.  Then we all realized the whole theme of sweetness was going to follow our whole meal.   My friend's beef rendang was tendered but it was overly sweet, beef rendang done right is not sweet at all.   I had the nasi lalapan lengkap which was a dish of fresh vegetable with a fried chicken with a spicy chili sauce along with a bowl of hot & sour soup.  The problem with this dish is that the hot & sour soup wasn't hot & sour....it was hot & sweet.   This is first for me where I haven't finish off a hot & sour soup in my life.  My other friends did enjoy the satays and the coconut rice....when it finally came out.  My Indonesian friend order the rijsttafel which is a tasting menu (22.95).....usually done in small dishes...but that came out to be normal side dishes portion and was able to get done with only 2 dishes.   She wish someone would have told her the portion sides because she was expecting tiny portions for the dinner. Needless to say none of us were very satisfied with our dishes and the horrible service did not help either.  We felt constantly ignored and what should have been an hour dinner turn into to a over 3 hour affair.   We all won't be going back there anytime soon.  I am being generous with the second star because some of the food did save them from a 1 star but their service really do need to be improve."
90,"I've lived in Indonesia for over 5 years and traveled throughout Indonesia & i was really looking forward to trying this place out...what a HUGE disappointment! some guy took our order, no smiles, no warmth...the otak was dull and tasteless...i can't remember what we ordered but whatever arrived smelled off and tasted off!  I brought it to this guy's attention and he's like that's Chinese style! is this a Chinese restaurant??? I'm part Chinese and I've never had food like this before! I've been eating out in 11 different countries and this was GROSS! I would never come back there. I have a feeling it's because he doesn't like black folk. I did not get an apology either."
91,"I'm Indonesian and I must say, the Sate Ayam (chicken) rivals my mom's.  I am a sweet-aholic from growing up in Alabama but the whole sweet thing did get to be too much.Rendang isn't supposed to be sweet, period.  My food came way earlier than my husband's and friend's did.  Which made them hungrier and angrier.The restaurant was packed on a weekend evening.  The wait to sit down wasn't too bad however, we didn't get our drinks for a good half hour.  Then two servers passed us and took our menus without taking our order.  Our entire meal took us about 3 hours to finished.  Horrible service, we decided not to leave much of a tip. And we almost usually leave 20%."
92,"All these wonderful reviews -- did I eat at the same place??  The food was mediocre AT BEST.  My friend's kebabs were edible but my calamari dish was not.  The spring rolls were decent but nothing out of the common way.  The service was terrible.  They brought my friend's food, and fifteen minutes later, mine.  Um, WHAT?  It's cheap to be sure, but so is McDonalds, right?  With so many excellent restaurants in the area, there is no reason to go back."
93,"I went here for an early dinner before class at the UC Extension, based on the strength of the recommendations on Yelp.  I was underwhelmed.  Maybe I've yet to acquire a taste for Indonesian food (I've never had it before), but I found the curry to be bland, the space a bit dingy, and the service indifferent."
94,"Maybe I haven't acquired a taste for Indonesian food, so for me the food here wasn't that great. Some dishes were ok, but nothing I would go back for. Service is very slow. The avocado shake with chocolate is pretty good, but it has a bit too much ice so it tastes watered down. But if you go with people who speak Indonesian, they make it so much better. It's thicker and you can taste more of the chocolate."
95,"At first the food seemed pretty good, albeit a bit mysterious. My husband and I could not identify a few items in our 3 dishes--probably a cultural problem on our part. But, seriously, the ""fish cake"" (I think it was that) was of a very gelatinous texture. Then there was a completely unidentifiable...starchy, heavy, greenish and white...i dunno, vegetable? Or was it cream of wheat balled up and boiled? It tasted OK, but I have a suspicion that it was this mystery object that later gave both of us a really horrible, expanded, bloated and painful and sick feeling that I am still enjoying 24 hours later. Plus, this takes the cake, when my husband went over to the bathroom, he came back with a weird look on his face. I later learned that someone was wretching in there, and he saw several bottles of medications in the kitchen on the shelf as he walked by. I just hope it wasn't the cook that was sick. Anyway, it's not that the food was really, really bad, at all, it just gave us very bad after effects. Sorry to the very friendly waiter...but we won't be back ever. Too bad, we should have just ordered the Satay like everyone else..."
