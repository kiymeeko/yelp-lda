0,"Very mediocre food, possibly the worst Thai food I've had. We ordered a thai fish cake appetizer, tofu pad thai, yellow curry, garlic shrimp plate, and a seafood noodle soup. The pad thai had broccoli, mushrooms, cabbage, and bok choy which was so strange to me because all of the pad thais I've had in the past didn't come with these ingredients. The seafood noodle soup didn't taste fresh. The yellow curry was overly creamy and coconutty. The thai fish cake was chewy and oily. I like the jar of crushed peanuts on the table and how late they're open."
1,"I was very happy to find this place still open at 1:15AM and the staff was very friendly, but this is the WORST Thai food I have ever had. Driving to get food after work and my excitement to eat yummy Thai food only turned in to utter disappointment after I had gotten all the way back to my house. Ordered both the eggplant with basil and pad see ew. Eggplant with basil came with no veggies or basil (which it was supposed to) Eggplant was cut in to pieces too large for consumption. Half my box was filled with rice (which is supposed to be an extra charge anyway but was instead used to fill the empty space from my tiny portion). Dish was completely lacking in flavor, I did not even eat it. Pad see ew also had no flavor except that of maple syrup.  The noodles were overdone and it was also thrown away. I will never be eating here again, even if it is my only option near me at 1 in the morning."
2,"This place changed hands a little while back and has really gone down hill. The flavors are no longer cooked in, my food tasted like they just took handfuls of ingredients, tofu, broccoli threw it on a plate and dumped peanut butter on top.The duck here used to be excellent and it is also not the same."
3,Went here tonight and the bugs in your food review(s) are beyond correct. Half way into my daughter eating her duck noodle soup we noticed bugs crawling on the bokchoy. The crazy part is when we notified them they immediately gave us the bill for our drinks. That definitely made us feel like this must be common.If you like to eats bugs GO HERE!
4,"This place has become such a a rip-off recently. I was always shocked by the bill when I compared to the tiny portion of food I got.Today I ordered the basil eggplant with shrimp (no rice), I was so surprised that the food barely filled 1/3 of my to-go box and I got charged $11.99 FOR THIS?!"
5,"My husband and I used to use this as our late night meal stop when it was Thai Noodle. We haven't been here in probably over a year and decided to stop by again.  Although the help is friendly, the food has taken a dive.  I am really not a picky eater and ever so rarely feel ill from food, but they crossed that threshold for my stomach.  Pad thai and fresh rolls both of which were not fresh made for my last meal here."
6,"After the change in ownership, they seemed to have upgraded the furniture but downgraded the food. Same menu but definitely not the same quality. Their curry and pad kee mao were bland and watered down. Pad thai noodles came out under-cooked and hard. On the second attempt to cook them, the dish came out drenched in gravy."
7,"Went here expecting some great noodles, but was disappointed. Great staff, very friendly, and quick. However, the food was not up to par. I ordered the yen ta foh (shrimp, squid, fish balls, and fish cake with noodle accented with spicy red sauce). It took about 10-12 minutes for it to arrive. I was deeply disappointed, when it first came. The soup base was not developed at all, zero flavor, and the broth was bright pink with food dye. Now at other restaurants I've been to, the yen ta foh I ordered was tomato/bean curd based with a rich, seafood broth and fresh seafood, but this place seemed to take a shortcut. I would not recommend ordering this dish."
8,"Be careful they already charged 18% tips on your check for six people! Actually, my husband and I joined our friends when they are almost done and we had separate bills. Although it was corrected after we complained about it but we feel like they should have let us know about the difference."
9,"Came in and order 2 pad thais and ask for peanuts on the Side do to a peanut allergy. The lady said ok, shortly after I received my food and took a bite.  Peanuts in my pad Thai! I walked in and asked the lady why there was peanuts and she stated you asked for them on the side and there on the side. She put them on the side inside the box of food. My face is swollen and I will never be back"
10,"Coworkers(4) and I went here for lunch during the week.  Usually a decent place to go for a fast lunch but on this day the waitress was salty, bitchy, not very rude.  We always ask for separate checks and usually there is never an issue but when we got our checks we were charged an 18% service charge for rude service.  She never informed us that we would get charged extra....needless to say we won't be going here anymore.  1 star because it's required to post otherwise it would have been 0."
11,One of the servers was super rude. Service was slow. Checked with her if my food is coming and she just yelled back. She also got the order wrong and the food came differently than what I ordered.
12,Dropped in for a pick up for some Tom Kha Ghai this evening. Woman with short hair at the register was very rude upon taking the order by phone and at pick up. Poor service for below average food is not a good look for this noodle spot. I do not recommend it.
13,"This location is CLOSED (Windows all covered up with paper - note says ""Coming Soon"")"
14,Greasy Thai place but gets the job done.Terrible service. Came in with my friend and servers saw us but no one came to help us. We just sat down at an empty table. Had to wait 20mins for someone to ask us what we wanted to order. We had to ask for water. No one came to refill it and we had to wait a long time to receive our food and for someone to give us our bill. Absolutely ridiculous.
15,"1st I went to this place with my friends after we played tennis and we all liked the foods, especially the Thai noodle boat... 2nd time I went there with my family to have some noodles but in the middle of eating my sister found live some kind of insect ( black ) in her noodle.. I was so embarrassed because I recommend this place to my family and we drove all the way from Oakland to this place (Berkeley). They didn't even apologize for what they did. It's a very irresponsible and unprofessional. There were few other guests who were eating next to our table but we didn't try to make a big drama. I hope they will be more careful next time and treat everyone with respect and accept their false. Disgusting:("
16,"We had terrible experience this week.  We, total of 11 people, made a reservation one week before.   On the same day, a lady called from the restaurant at 10:30 am to confirm the reservation. I (and another person next to me) told the lady that we would be there. She said that we had to call her before 11:45am if we wanted to cancel it (the reservation was at 12:30am).  Around 12:15pm, I called to confirm the reservation again.  She said that the table was not available anymore because I didn't call her before 11:45am, but the table would be available in 15 minutes.  I said OK, 15 or 20 minutes later we got there (11 people).  The table was not ready and she said that we had to wait another 15 minutes...unbelievable Lie After Lie!!!   Not go there anymore!!!"
17,Wtffffffffffffffffffffff seriously worst Thai food ever stay away great service honestly but man so bad. We had the fish cake for app it was so bad that the waitress without us even telling her it was bad she came to the table at the end of our meal and told us she was going take it off the tab and asked us why we didn't like I had to be honest even though she was nice told her it was way to salty n it was breaded like tempura never had fish cake likel that ever. I had the pad Thai with was ok bland but was ok not horrible hunny had the green curry shrimp same thing bland but not horrible. I'm soar because this place is actually a bat area chain n the one in alameda is sooooooooooooooo much better. Again great service just fire the cook seriously smh
18,"Thaiboat noodle taste like instant broth.you can tell right away and I saw them just boil water first.not the slow broth pot.meat is not tender at all.I ask for side condiment the short hair boyish looking lady was extremely rude.I ask for water she was to busy playing with her phone ignored me.I ask again she responded rudely""You said it twice already I know!"" So if you heard me then say something instead of spacing out into your dam cellphone!! Never again"
19,I called for the pickup they told me it's gonna take 15 min. I came ever 25 min after and I'm waiting still 25 min and they even dint say sorry...it's a worst service place I got in Berkely ....I don't know there food because still I don't get chance to eat because I'm waiting...
20,"used postmates to get some hot tom yum and spicy larb after work due to being feverish and extremely ill (thank you coworker for sharing your cold with me before toodling off to the burn)the food was hot even thru rush hour traffic which was impressive but my sense of satisfaction sadly ends therenow i should preface my review by sharing that i am a stupid white person so you may wish to disregard my opinion simply based on thati am a huge fan of extremely spicy thai food. nothing has carried me thru illness faster than a steaming oily chili-gleaming bowl of hot tom yum. i have practiced with my sri lankan roomie many a time making homemade tom yum and tom kha the traditional way with lots of galangal, coriander, and citrus zesti tasted no such things in my tom yum, which tasted simply like an overdressed can of campbell's tomato soup. it was not even spicy, let alone sour. the larb was a massive disappointment - tasted barely seasoned, no citric flavor or spice. i specifically requested extra spice and was given a small tub of tomato chili paste. ok, but that doesn't help me with my larb at all. the greens it came with were wilted and had a dissatisfying bitterness that did nothing to complement the larb gai.i'm used to thai food having a high markup in restaurants and i'm happy to pay it for good authentic food but paying $20 for this fare was an extra topping of misery to an already awful afternoon.if you love seasoning, herbs, spice, flavor, or have had really good thai food before... you should look elsewhere."
21,"Absolutely horrific service. I will start with a positive and say that I've been going here for late night food for the past year. And have always loved the food.However, around 10:00PM on Wednesday, I walked in to get red curry for take out. I asked for red curry, and the waiter asked me what about three times before writing down my order. He seemed to be absolutely ""weeded"" by customers, even though I was one of five people in the restaurant. And seemed even more perplexed by a simple question, ""does adding brown rice to my order cost extra?""After a short wait after ordering my food, I was quickly served my curry and left.When I got home, I found I was served green curry with chicken, even though clearly staying ""Ref Curry with Beef."" If it had been a language barrier, I would be ok. But considering the waiter had no accent to his English, I'd say this was more of a competency issue. While I will continue to go here, I will never walk into that place if said waiter is on shift.Again, great food. Unfortunately the service was so terrible for me, the food wasn't enough for me to change my opinion of dinning here."
22,"Thai Noodle is around the corner from my home, and I wish it could be my go to Thai restaurant,but it will NEVER HAPPEN!  This restaurant has the absolutely WORST customer service of anyrestaurant in my 70 years of eating out!!! If you call for a take out order, it is NEVER ready when they say it will be. They start your take out order when you arrive to pick it up, so you wait another 15-20 minutes..pitiful! When you eat in the restaurant, the service is extremely UNFRIENDLY and SLOW. PITIFUL! This is really unfortunate, since the food is pretty ok. With so many outstanding Thai restaurants in Berkeley, this place should be your last choice."
23,Nam tok salad tastes like a chicken mimosa. Not even kidding. Think mint leaves and chicken.
24,"Berkeley is known for being the gourmet ghetto.So eat in the gourmet ghetto area, don't come here.Not only does nothing taste authentic.It doesn't even taste good.Come on Thai Noodle, get it together, you have too many options to not have particularly good food!On the bright side, their spiciness level is definitely in the business!"
25,"I would give it a no star but yelp won't give me the option. The service was ok, the bathroom and back hallway was filthy and then there was a bug in my soup."
26,Friendly staff. Food went down well and tasted good if a little salty...but I've felt like crap for two days after eating it. I think they use msg and additives/packet mixes? Will avoid in future...
27,"This place is alright. Honestly not somewhere I'd come back to only because I've been twice and tried different things each time and I never liked any of them. The food is different types of noodles tossed in different sauces. Very bland. No real flavor. Very Americanized wanna be Asian... Not worth the $9 in my opinion. I liked the decor though, kind of a Chinese/Japanese look. But kind of dark. Needs brighter lights. Oh and the service is alright too. The last time I was there the waiter was nice but he didn't really come back to check on us or refill our waters. Give it a try yourself though."
28,"There is a lot of better Thai food in Berkeley. If you are a poor college student with a craving for Thai food, I could see how this place would suffice, but I ate here once and I see no need to return. This came as a surprise to me because it seems like it's always busy. I ordered a dish with crab on it, which was a terrible idea. Don't ever order crab from a cheap restaurant. I think I had two bites of my food and had to stop. Another detail I noticed that turned me off from the place was the lighting; I think it may have made the food look even more unappetizing than it already was. Admittedly, the service was fine, but not good enough to make up for the lack luster food."
29,They forgot my order while in my group of 5. They didn't even apologize or offer a discount. I will never come here again.
30,"Food was average. I sat towards the back by the kitchen when suddenly one of the waitress is standing around by the register, I figured she was waiting for the next order to be called, did not expect the waitress to be scratching her crotch region as if I wasn't there at all.Don't think I'm going to come back."
31,"I love pad Thai , so when I read in the menu that they had a different kind of a pad Thai , I was so excited . Big mistake . The won sen pad Thai was was worst Thai food I ever had . They say it comes with ""seafood"" but you get 2 pieces of shrimp and other ""fish "" meat like cold huge pieces of fake crab meat . I tried the beef pad se ew and that was pretty good . I guess I was really unlucky in what I picked . The service was really nice tho ."
32,"I went here for lunch today because one of my group mate's suggested this place and because I needed to go somewhere that accepted card since I didn't have cash.My two favorite dishes from any thai restaurant is the pad see ewe and the pad kee mao. Maybe it was my mistake for ordering the pad kee mao here when the popular reviews referenced to the pad see ewe. But I was looking for something spicy with just enough kick to get me through the rest of my group project.I was disappointed. The pad kee mao wasn't spicy at all! Drunken noodles are supposed to be spicy and full of flavor. My dish had no spice and it seemed like it had some kind of chicken gravy going on in it. It was almost slimy. I didn't finish it which is a first when it comes to Thai food. I also got thai iced tea in a to go cup. I kept drinking it thinking why is this so sweet and why isn't it creamy? I found out later on that all the milk was on the top and that it wasn't stirred or anything. If they are going to do that they should at least use clear plastic cups so you can see the separation and realize that you have to shake it up.Honestly, waste of money. Avoid this place. Make the extra effort to walk to Thai Basil in the asian ghetto."
33,"Not ok if you have celiac or dietary issues with gluten. I begged the waitress to let me see the peanut sauce bottle to find out if there was gluten in it and she swore up and down that there was no gluten, but wouldn't let me see the bottle. You can guess what happened after I ate. *Not* gluten-free. *Not* safe if you need to rely on your waitperson to give you accurate information about what you're eating."
34,"The masaman curry was tasty enough but the chicken in it was disgusting.  You could literally taste how much it was pumped up with chemicals and hormones, as it had a very soft texture unnatural to unprocessed chicken.  I would come back here but ONLY to order tofu or veggie curry, as I don't trust whoever is supplying them."
35,Not great Thai. I've had much better around the area. Seems that it gets good reviews because it is open late and quick service. I don't really want the McDonald's of Thai. I want legit Thai food and it was very subpar
36,"Had chicken pumpkin curry last night and my wife had tom kha ga soup. My wife got sick within 5 minutes of finishing her meal and became very dizzy, and I got sick within a half hour of finishing mine. There have been other comments about cleanliness, too."
37,"Thai noodle (the original) is standard, average thai food. The fried chicken over fried rice is the classic dish here."
38,"I got the seafood noodle....My soup was fuchsia pink.  It tasted fuchsia pink. All I could think of was the shade of fuchsia pink.  Although this place has good ratings...I'm kind of scared to go back. I had to pretend I liked what I was eating...and I really was just scared of that extremely pink soup. Okay maybe it wasn't Fuchsia pink...Wikipedia says it was more of a ""Hollywood Cerise,"" whatever that is."
39,"Yet another Thai restaurant in the Thai restaurant capital of the world (Berkeley), outside of Thailand.Overripe mango in the sticky rice dessert. Otherwise the Tom Yum soup was right on (not too salty).Decent service.Filthy pathway to the restroom. You could easily grease Chicago politics with all that slip n' sliding lard on the floor."
40,"DISGUSTING. It's so bad that I'm yelping at 2am on a Sat night so I can get it all out while it's fresh in my memory.We came here after drinking at Jupiter b/c Jupiter's kitchen was already closed. It was HORRIBLE. The summer rolls were disgusting and filled with cheap salad mix and disgusting imitation crab. They were also served with some gross sauce that isn't at all like the peanut sauce that summer rolls usually come with.My FI and I then split the pad thai and our friend at the pad see-ew. Both had a really weird sour pungent flavor to them. And it was not lime or fish sauce, it was just off putting and fowl.Service was NON- EXISTENT someone took our order, brought us our food, brought us our check. That was it. No asking how it was (they know they are serving these college kids bad food), no asking if we needed any refills, and no taking my card when it was time to pay.Who care's if it's cheap? I ate all of four bites (one bite of the summer roll, two bits of the pad thai, one bite of the pad see-ew) and spit out one of those of the bites (a piece of tofu in the pad thai was so overcooked I could not chew it). It's not cheap if it's inedible. Note: My review isn't even based on the horrible presentation (the food is just thrown on the plate) and the fact that the restaurant is GROSS. I don't even want to know it's health rating. There were bowls of ingredients sitting out on the table behind us. What the hell?"
41,"This place was everything that I hate about Thai food in the US. I really don't understand the favorable reviews. I ordered the red curry with pumpkin and pork. It was so bad. It was essentially overcooked pork, undercooked pumpkin and raw bell peppers floating in a watery sugar broth with hints of coconut and yellow coloring. I was RAVENOUSLY hungry, having just biked 25 miles before eating here and I still hated it. If you are a foodie, or have any kind of appreciation for the true nature of Thai food, don't go here. I don't understand how they could so utterly and completely butcher such a wonderful cuisine. I also tried my bf's dish. He got the thai bbq over rice. It tasted like gross Chinese food. Maybe if I was really, really, really drunk and hadn't eaten for 3 days and didn't know what good Thai food tasted like, I could eat here.Actually, I would probably still hate it. Just because its cheap doesn't mean its good. And this place is most definitely the antithesis of good. If you want cheap food fast...get pizza."
42,"I've eaten here twice after reading the generally positive reviews, and I'm starting to think that they were all written by delirious Cal students who have been studying too much or people stumbling over from Triple Rock after downing a few pints. I'm not a student, and I was sober both of the times I ate here. It is without a doubt the worst Thai food I've had on Shattuck.The Pad Thai looked like it had been tossed in ketchup or tomato paste, and it tasted like it too. There was absolutely no balance of sweet, sour, and salty, which is what makes Pad Thai taste so good. Also, if you're lucky enough to sit at a table under the neon lights, the glow from the lights will reflect off of the glowing red noodles and hit your face like a punch in the eyes.The second time I ate here I tried the Thai Boat Noodles. Instead of a dark, flavorful broth, I was served a murky, oily mess. I couldn't distinguish the flavors of any of the ingredients, and it was so oily that I could only eat half of the bowl.Despite the lackluster food, there are a few redeeming qualities to the restaurant. It's one of the only restaurants in Berkeley that stays open past midnight, the prices are cheap, and the service is fast. Unfortunately, the food is so bad that my friends and I won't even eat here after a night of drinking at Triple Rock. If you want your stomach to be happy, walk up Shattuck and pay a few extra dollars to enjoy way better Thai food at Cha-Am or Dara."
43,"I was kinda shocked to see ""10th Anniversary"" in the window when I ate there tonight. Has it really been open that long?I remember going in soon after it first opened, excited that there was another late night eatery in sleepy Berkeley (about the only thing I miss about LaLa is the great 24 hour food options, including the excellent Sanamluang Cafe, which I also discovered soon after they opened, and has a similar fast food ambiance). Though I can't recall what I ate then, I do recall that first meal was really bad. It's rare to find a bad Thai restaurant, and I gave the waiter a few comments in the hopes it was opening shakiness and they might find their footing.So I've been there a handful of times since it has opened, when I've wanted Thai food and everything else is closed. And after eating, I understood why I had only been there a few times in the decade. It's simply not good. In particular, it's the greasiest Thai food I've ever had, the opposite of what one expects, just swimming in oil. Thai food has always been something I crave when I want something with clean bright flavors and not too heavy. This place makes me feel like I just ate at a bad Cantonese restaurant.Having never been to Thailand, I don't know if Thai Noodle actually might be more authentic with its greasiness than the Thai food I prefer. No matter, I've paid Thai Noodle my final visit in my ten year trial."
44,"Are you kidding me??? My late-night go-to is Bangkok Noodles & BBQ, just a few doors down, but I figured I should try Thai Noodle, since I wanted takeout tonight, and the place looks like crap (suggesting that takeout is the thing to do here). It is indeed fast and friendly; I received my order in 3 minutes, but once I got home, I understood why. Both dishes were utterly tasteless. The chicken had been cooked separately and without any seasoning, so that it could be added to any dish at the last minute. And the Pad See Eew (which ain't rocket science) was a pile of tasteless noodles - a little bland chicken, a few florets of broccoli, and no see eew waan. If not for the nam pla prik and kecap manis in my pantry, I would've had to dump the lot into the trash."
45,"Too much oil.A weird smell.The to-go box looks ugly and cheap.I don't know...maybe I shouldn't give such a bad review cuz their food is ok, but considering that downtown has so many Thai restaurant, so in comparison, this one can only be 2 star.It's close to where I live, but now I'd rather go further to Lucky House or Bangkok for to-go. Never this one again."
46,"This place gets high ratings from other reviewers because it's open late and it's on the same street as Triple Rock.  Put those together, and you get... drunk reviewers.  Or at least drunk diners, who then go on to write reviews when they are more sober but no more correct.Guess what?  It's just another Thai place.  Greasy noodles, flourescent lighting, small tables -- nothing to write home about."
47,This by far has been the worst Thai food that I have ever tried. The only reason that I did not give them 1 star is they have great customer service. I ordered spicy Pad Thai and received a whole bunch of crushed peppers mixed in to the noodles. I also ordered spicy BBQ chicken and received a bed of rice with about a half a pound of crushed peppers. The chicken did not taste like anything BBQ it was more like boiled chicken cut into strips. The Thai Iced tea was too sweet. If you still decide to come to this place make sure you do not order anything spicy and avoid everything that I ordered.
48,"A Thai roommate of mine once told me that Thai Noodle was a good, authentic place, better than Cha Am down Shattuck. I am never listening to her again.I got the Eggplant delight, which is stuffed eggplant in green curry. The chicken was fatty and the eggplant so-so. It would have been okay, had it not been for THE RICE. It is the worst rice I have ever eaten in any Asian restaurant I've ever gone to. Overcooked, hard, and clearly scraped off the bottom of the rice cooker, brown remnants and all. And, an hour later, my stomach it starting to hurt. Cha Am, I will never betray you again."
49,"This one star is for the Thai Noodle Boat dish that I ordered for lunch. Really really bad. The waitress told me it was like pho, which was what I was in the mood for. Instead, this soup base is super dark and more salty and bland than flavorful. Just too dark. The only other flavor I really tasted was anise. Other cons - this noodle soup had too much oil and chili sauce pre-added. The meatballs were good, but the rest of the meat was tough. I asked for the noodles that are like pho noodles (I got the flat rice noodles), which turned out to be ho phun noodles. Last thing - if you order to go, they put the bean sprouts in with the noodles, which means that they'll get cooked by the heat of the noodles. So don't expect crispy bean sprouts.I was hungry, so I ate this anyway. Boo. Now all this is sloshing around in my tummy:(I actually had a very delicious noodle soup with bbq pork, wontons, and egg noodles at Thai Noodle II, so this was disappointing."
50,"Cheap.  Open late.  That's the two stars.I have stopped going with other people.Now I go when I'm coming home late from work.  I am hungry, and want Thai.  Generally it's Pad Thai, because I've had a bad day, and I find it to be comforting.What is not comforting are the occasional off flavors that have come once from the egg and once from the shrimp.  I stopped getting it with shrimp.  But you can't leave out the egg.  Maybe two stars is one too generous."
51,"I loved this place. The noodle soups were always delicious. And I've never got disappointed by other dishes either. But my friend and I went back last Thursday, I ordered the Duck Noodle Soup. Somehow, the soup taste changed, I could smell the difference as soon as they delivered it to me. And my friend's Crab Fried Rice was too dry and bland.I expect a nice restaurant to be consistent with their food taste.But the servers are nice and friendly as always."
52,"1 star for opening LATE2nd star for the PRICE & mediocre foodI recommend the pad kee mao with beef & the flat rice noodle, the salmon wrapped in banana leaf was okay, but i don't think i would get it again, & the thai tea is pretty good. It's pretty similar to the king of thai in alameda except thai noodle takes credit cards. Good place to go if you got the munchies hella late."
53,"I think I'm being too nice...I got the sukiyaki at first but had to return it because of its disturbing smell. I then got the BBQ pork and Chinese sausage dish and thought that it was way too sweet. When I was almost half way done, I accidentally spilled some sauce (brownish with halapenos inside) on my food and I just couldn't....I just got home and my stomach doesn't feel right :\"
54,"The chicken fried rice($5.95) and garlic shrimp($6.95) was good, the Thai boat noodle soup($5.95) was horrible, but the Thai iced tea($1.50) made up for it a little bit. Our waitress was slow and not very cheerful. I doubt that i'll be coming back."
55,"It's pretty terrible, but it seems to be the place for Thai for locals. I have no idea why.  Their veggies are both undercooked and waterlogged. I am amused by their attempt at a rotating art display, though."
56,"Had the pad see ew, unfortunately it was not very tasty. It was down right funky. The eggplants basil dish was yummy but the music was so loud that conversing was unpleasant as well. I was really sorry we came here."
57,"I wish I could give a lower rating.I used to eat here all the time until their peanut tofu sent me to the emergency room at alta bates. I sent my boyfriend in  to tell them about it (I was too embarrassed because I knew everyone who worked there so well) and they responded ""it happens"".  no sorry, no we're working on improving our bacteria problem - it's just to be expected.so I put them out of my mind completely until recently when I was in the neighborhood with some time to kill and an empty stomach.  I didn't want to go there, but I was curious, you see.  the tables and chairs were all new, and so were the employees.  my salad was alright (though I didn't ask for fish balls in it) but one thing I cannot tolerate is getting charged more than the price on the menu.  it's lying.  it's cheating.  granted, they didn't try to take me for much ($0.60) but it's the principle.  basically, this place is cheap, with all the bad connotations, none of the good."
58,"Went there for some Pad See EWWWWW--probably one of the worst PSE's I've had in a long, long time.  Could even be the worst.You could do better (see Thai Basil, asian ghetto)."
59,"I like me my Thai foodz.  This place, though?  This place isn't that great.  The reason I find myself coming back to this place is because it's open later than other restaurants in the area and the food isn't terrible.  Also, the service isn't that bad either.  I don't know what it is, but the food doesn't really seem to hold flavors as well as other Thai restaurants I've been to."
60,"Great prices and fun atmosphere but I am a Thai food snob since I spent almost a year in Thailand.  I LOVE salty food and this food, at least the one time I came, was SO salty I could barely finish.  I loved the menu and choices and the flavor was good but the salt totally killed it for me for BOTH the dishes that I tried.Oh and the bathroom was the MOST disgusting bathroom I have ever stepped foot in.  There was a gigantic industrial sized overflowing garbage can right in the middle of the bathroom.  I was shocked."
61,"I love Thai food, but I hate this restaurant.Thai Noodle's night dining was like a nightmare. The only thing redeeming about this place is the fact that it stays open so late, which is why we went there in the first place. But we definitely did not get our money's worth.The service was sub par, the neon lighting was annoying, and the food tasted awful.This restaurant screwed up pad Thai. PAD THAI. The quintessential, simplest, most commonly offered dish in Thai restaurants. That fact alone was enough to ensure that I stay as far away from this restaurant as possible. I'm the kind of person who likes to judge the quality of Thai restaurants by their simple, common dishes like pad Thai because it's a standard dish, so taste and presentation should not vary so much. I've had Thai food in different parts of the U.S., and the taste of pad Thai remains virtually the same. NOT SO IN THIS PLACE. I second another reviewer's observation that the pad Thai looked like the noodles were tossed in ketchup--and tasted like it, too. The chicken in the dish was overcooked, and the presentation was lacking. I could only take a few bites and gladly refused to take the leftovers home. What kind of Thai restaurant messes up pad Thai?In all fairness, my boyfriend ordered the pumpkin curry, which I ate with him (because my pad Thai was bad). That curry was good, but not great. That's the only reason this restaurant gets 2 stars instead of 1. All in all, the atmosphere wasn't great; the restaurant was crowded and noisy; and the neon lighting was obnoxious.Unless you're drunk or desperate for a late night snack and don't care about the quality of food you're paying for, you should avoid this place."
62,"This place sucks. I ordered a Thai BBQ chicken over fried rice and half my plate was literally onions, tomatoes and the 3 cucumbers. I like my meat and hate the onions, this place was the worst for me. Never in my life had I ever had a meal filled with so much onions and tomatoes. Don't come here unless you are a fan of paying for a $8 meal and having $4 worth of onions and tomatoes."
63,"This is a review by vegetarianBlech.My dining companion (DC) said she comes here all the time and they know her. She said our mutual friend says this is her favorite. I can only assume that they never ordered the #42 Teow something or other with tofu. Regular readers know that I am bound to order this or something similar based on the premise that one should order a dish with the restaurants title-food in it.The noodles are gummy,. The peanut sauce was abyssmal. Peanuts, garlic, ginger, some brown sugar or simlar sweetener, soy, a vinegar, something hot.. it's not that hard to make. Here, the ""chef"" has opted for an even easier recipe: open jar. This jar has been laying around since 1972 before the majority of the population  in California started eating Thai regularly. One star for icky peanut sauce over gummy noodles with uncooked tofu cubes.Plus a star for the fried potato pockets as an appetizer. Those were yummy."
64,"More or less identical to Thai noodle 2, but with worse ambiance and a worse location."
65,I officially will not come here again I  been coming here for years but theyre food and quality are going down everytime I come back it get worst with the flavor so bland  I hope they find the old cooks
66,"The food here USED to be good, but it's gone steadily down over the months. The pineapple fried rice and duck fried rice here used to be really good. But sadly enough, either because they changed cooks, or what not, the past 4 - 5 experiences have been pretty bad.... This echoes what Jeff F says. Oh well, I'm really sad because I used to eat here all the time."
67,"This restaurant was a recommendation from a local and the first time was fabulous! I have been there several times since and the food has always been great. But the last couple of times have been so-so. I tried one of their specials pumpkin and basil tofu, and it was not great. I do love their #7 special - fish dish. Sadly, their service and quality has gotten sloppy. But I think I will try another Thai place if visiting the Berkeley area."
68,"I went on a saturday around lunchtime and most of the table were occupied. I ordered some chicken soup with egg noodles. It contained fish cake, balls, and some chicken. The broth was very bland. My friend ordered the Boat noodle soup and he said it also lacked flavor. We also shared the seafood salad which tasted like lime juice, fish sauce and crushed red pepper, not very exciting at all.The atmosphere is not as dumpy as i expected based on other reviews. Service was good and the prices were fair. I don't think I'll be coming back here again.  Nothing special."
69,"I've lived in the neighborhood for, oh, 3 years, without wanting to go in here. There's something about the overdose of neon light that makes this place look unappetizing to me. But all good things must come to an end: a colleague of mine took me here for lunch.Not as bad as I expected. Not good either, but certainly not bad.So a week or two later I came back in the evening for take-out dinner. It was delicious. Except that afterwards my jaws were hurting. MSG is the cheap and easy way of making food delicious. Too bad my body can't handle it very well."
70,I absolutely do not like thai noodle. the food is very blend and greasy. service is mediocre. I think the restaurant is very popular because of late night hours and cheap price. But if you go there for tasting delicious thai food there are many better choices in Berkeley.
71,"This place *used to* rock.  It seems to have been taken over, because the staff changed, and suddenly the food and service got a *lot* worse.It used to be amazingly tasty for a place that's open so late and priced so cheaply.  Now, the food lacks color and flavor, is made with enough grease to choke an elephant.  The price has jumped a lot, too.These days, I much prefer the weird Thai place in the Durant food court."
72,The only thing this place has going for it is they're open late at night...Should one expect more even if it is a dive restaurant?The sauces all seemed to be similar and overly sweet.  I would only come if I was craving Thai food late at night and there were no other options available.
73,"PROS:  Cheap and open late.CONS: The food doesn't taste very good and is always greasy.Maybe the problem is that I don't go out drinking often enough to really appreciate this place.  In my opinion, though, there are many, many better options in Berkeley (though very few are open late).  So...meh, I've experienced better."
74,"I've been to Thai noodle a few times before and their food is good and decently priced. And I mean good for generic/American style Thai food. I much prefer Dara Thai down the street. There were 5 of us, My girlfriend and I were on one tab, my friend and his lady were on one tab and our other friend was on his own separate tab. When it came to paying we were handed one bill with our prices each circled. We put all of our money on the tray then the waitress took it. We sat there for about ten minutes, boxed up our food an impatiently waited. We finally asked where our change was and a different older woman waiter came back and threw a bunch of random numbers in our face, (I quote ""88 dollars!"" Our tab was only 44.....) to confuse us. She insisted on not giving us our change, trying to take it for tip. This was combined money, and we had to figure out the tip individually, because we didn't have exact change. She continually mouthed off to us, then finally brought us our change. After feeling offended and weirded out about the lady trying to take our money and then harassing us about wanting our change back we decided to leave her only a 2 dollar tip (which I don't ever generally do). We got up and started to walk out and she rushed to our table, grabbed the money, proceeded to follow us outside of the restaurant then yelled at us that she didn't want our ""2 dollar tip"" and tossed the money back to our friend. SO just be warned you may not receive the best service."
75,"The red curry and the tom yum was way too sweet for me. The tom yum was okay. For the price, its probably the cheapest thai place I went to. The quality of the food was by far the worst. They have great service there, the people are nice. I wish they didnt undercook the chicken and maybe cut it in smaller pieces to avoid PINK CHICKEN. that really killed my experience with the rawness because me tasting half raw chicken made me wanna throw up. For the sweetness and bad quality, Id rather cook it myself at home. I would rather pay 20$ more to go to a better and more authentic thai place. Since this is one of my brothers fav places to go to when he went to Cal, I'll recommend this to college students who wanna eat thai at a cheaper price. For Red Curry $7Tom Yum Soup $7+1.25extra for noodleYoung Coconut juicy (best part of this meal) $3Bill was $20+tip (VERY CHEAP! i normally wont come out of a thai place under 30$ for 2 people)Overall, Their Portions are MUCH bigger than any other thai place but it has to taste good. i mean.. cheap food can taste good right? but they didnt present themselves as good as they are supposed to be... (since they gave me half raw chicken)Maybe there are other things that are better on the menuI would give 1 star but I think they can do better"
76,"Decided to give this place another try after a very disppointent first visit. Came in a couple of weeks ago and got two combos for dinner to go.  The waitress was very nice and helpful. Ordered duck and chicken  I had asked the waitress about the portion size and she said it was a good amount. The portion size was so small, like a little bento box, and each dish was about  9 bucks. The menu photos show  large plates, which gives the impression that's what you're getting.   My last visit there!!"
77,"Got some take out here last night and it was probably the poorest Thai food I've had in Berkeley. We got Pad Thai, Pad Kraw Paw, and Papaya Salad. The Pad Thai had a weird ketchupy taste and they didn't include either limes or lemons. The Pad Kraw Paw was awfully bland and had utterly no spice to it. The only thing keeping this place out of the one star category is the fact that the papaya salad was actually pretty good. Certainly not good enough to bring me back, but it at least salvaged some enjoyment of the meal. With the plethora of good Thai food in Berkeley, there's really no reason to come here other than the fact that it's open late and you're drunk."
78,"Oh Thai Noodle. I was glad they were open late, due to my appetite's odd hours, but I was sorely disappointed. The place was dirty (no soap in the bathrooms!! Wet, slippery floors!!)Their pad thai was much too sweet, thai tea was mediocre, and their larb salad wasn't really a salad! it was a plate of ground up chicken with some chopped up cabbage on the side. ugh. The positive? it was cheap. oh and late hours."
79,"EDIT: went back a few nights later and I guess the pad thai is hit or miss. It wasnt spectacular, but definitely better than the previous time. Another late night Thai restaurant to kill the cravings. This one situated right next to tripple rock is open till 1:30 am. So stumble over here after a few rounds if that's your thing. It was about 11 and the choices were limited. I noticed this place awhile ago and even walked up the door only to turn around. I came here because someone I know had said they liked the food, but their taste is questionable. Cheap and large portions rules over quality any day for them. Being a Thai fanatic and wandering Thai town down in Los Angeles many many times I've had my fair share of good ol Thai food.  As we were approaching the door I saw the server already grabbing two menus and two glasses of water before we even reached for the handle. There was only one other table with a couple when we arrived, but I just have this thing for drawing crowds in... so by the time we left the place was packed. Yup yup... that how I roll.  Our courses for the night were the stuffed angel wings, chicken pad thai, pineapple fried rice, and fried banana with coconut ice cream as a finisher. The angel wings came out a tad dry and salty to me. The sauce accompanying it was pretty odd tasting as well. Usually the sauce is somewhat of a sweet glaze, but they had added peppers and some other ingredients that threw me off guard and didn't quite fit right. The pad thai noodles were a bit rubbery and chewy. The chicken was tender and the sauce quite nice, but it was the texture of the noodles that killed it for me. The pineapple fried rice was probably the best dish I had the evening. Flavorful and full of meat, although the beef I could have done without.    I did opt for no raisins since I am not a big fan. As for the dessert... the fried bananas were so so. The breading was good, but a tad much for the amount of banana that was inserted inside. Had they put twice the amount of banana it probably wouldn't be too bad. The ratio was about 4:1 of breading to banana so that kind of put a damper on it. The coconut ice cream was ok although lacking and full of air. Service was good, but I think the server got annoyed that we stayed and talked when we finished eating."
80,"I have one word to say about this restaurant -- YUCK!!! This was absolutely the WORST Thai food I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of Thai food. When I first walked in, my first instinct was to walk out and try one of the other half a dozen Thai restaurants down the street. The place was so dirty. I should have gone with my instinct! Anyway, I decided to give it a try and ordered the red curry with pumpkin and beef and a Thai iced tea, which was good -- not too sweet. The red curry was boring and flavorless, and not even spicy! The beef was rancid and the pumpkin, which actually looked like acorn squash (not pumpkin) was not even peeled! After taking a couple of bites of the disgusting, rancid beef and peeling the skin off the squash, I ended up eating only the red bell peppers with my rice. I immediately felt the effect of the MSG rushing through my veins. It was the worst MSG rush I ever felt. I was prepared to end up with food poisoning as I left the restaurant, but fortunately I have an iron stomach.Just add this restaurant to the long list of REALLY bad and mediocre dining options in Berkeley. They're not even deserving of a full star!! Absolutely NASTY!!"
81,A friend of mine took me out to this place telling me it's pretty good. I ordered #33(don't remember the name) and egg rolls and neither of them were good. I was disappointed by the taste and they definitely use a lot of MSG and I know it when I get really thirsty after a meal. I've had much better Thai food and this one I would have to give only two stars. I do like the fact that they are open late and accept credit cards. That's all.
82,I stopped by this place on a Friday night two weeks ago and ordered noodle. The dish tastes so-so but I find metal in the dish! A 1-inch square object made in tin-kind metal material was found after I finished half of the dish! It could damage my teeth or hurt the stomach.  The waiter didn't know where it came from and how to solve this.
83,"I used to like this place. The prices are reasonable and food is good, but I've been letdown too many times in recent months to go back again. I've learned my lesson. I like the thick, pan-fried rice noodle dish that has chicken, chili, basil, and green beans in it. The last four times I've gone in they've not had the thick rice noodle and I've had to substitute the thin rice noodle. It's not the same. And this place is a NOODLE place. Order some noodles that appear on your menu!! It's like wanting fettucine and getting angel hair. And today at lunch I went in, attempted to order the dish again, was told they were out of chicken, and then later told they were out of the thick rice noodles. So I ordered a different dish and left for the last time."
84,Are you guys kidding me? The Pad Thai here is horrible. There was absolutely no flavor and the ingredients tasted like it came out of a can. I love Thai food but this place just sucks.
85,"I have a life rule:  I'll try anything three times.  I've been to Thai Noodle twice, and my life rule is in serious danger of being broken.  This place is utterly terrible!The only positive I can say about the place is that at least you get a TON of terrible food."
86,This is a hole in the wall alright.  After you feel numb from the bad neon lighting your palette will be numb after trying to eat the food.  Poor quality ingredients and poor cooking will leave a bad taste after you're done.  You're better off spending your $8 elsewhere like Plearn or Tuk Tuk Thai.
87,"Used to be delicious, maybe now that I dont go at 1 am after a bar it doesnt taste as good. It also often has a smell of some weird cleaning chemical. Gross. It is running on its reputation, not on any real quality."
