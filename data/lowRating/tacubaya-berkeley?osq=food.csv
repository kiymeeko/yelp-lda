0,"I don't even know where to begin with this review. I have never been in a Mexican restaurant where they don't have any salsas to put on your tacos, they were basically ""naked"" a little bit of cilantro and onion and the tortas with just avocado??  No tomatoes or lettuce When  we asked for salsa we were directed to their ""selection "" of bottled salsas really!!! Plus no flavor on any of the meats, the most decent one was al pastor but they run out on a Sunday during lunchtime. I wanted to find something new but I'll keep going to my old favorite ones like Picante and tacos el gordo."
1,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
2,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
3,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
4,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
5,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
6,"The food here is so bland!!!! No matter how much Tapitio you dump on your plate, it still won't resurrect the flavor :-(  the veggie tacos were okay, rice and beans okay, chips & salsa bleh, everything was just lacking spice! Just avoid this place and go to a hole in the wall that actually has decent Mexican food. I'm so disappointed!!"
7,The worst chilaquiles I've ever had. Tasteless Scrambled eggs on top of soaked tortilla chips and zero flavor. We might have ordered the wrong thing since the place was packed
8,"Had the seasonal quesadilla.  Hit Taco Bell on the way home.  In terms of portions, quality and price, preferred Taco Bell."
9,"No burritos??  Good grief... that fact alone makes me want to give it 1 star!  I went for lunch.  I got a vegetarian torta.  I just ate it like 18 minutes ago, and I'm hungry again.  Very small.  It was $10, and didn't come with chips.  It tasted okay, but was remarkably unfilling.  I haven't tried anything else but doubt I will go back.  No burritos and the other reviews confirm my suspicions - overpriced, small portions of mediocre food.  But great customer service, +1 star."
10,"Bland bland blandHad the chips and salsa and beef enchiladas. No spice, no taste. Chipotle is better. Will not return."
11,"I want to start off by saying the food was tasty, the service fine, and the prices not totally unreasonable for the area. Unfortunately this was my first visit and they did something I think is really unacceptable. I asked the cashier about the spice level of the Tuna Ceviche, she said it was medium spicy. So I explained that I can't do spicy, I love the taste but due to a medical condition it causes extreme pain for me to eat it. She informed me that they could remove the jalapeños and it wouldn't be spicy anymore. So I ordered it. I get home and I take a single bite. It really was tasty but it hurt SOO much. I'm sure it was considered only slightly spicy, but I needed NOT spicy and I made it very clear that i couldn't handle spicy. I said it several times. And now I spent a lot of money on something that causes me extreme pain. And I've tried to eat it because it tastes good and I don't have a lot of money to spend so frivolously, but after doing the whole one giant chip-one tiny bite of ceviche- plus beans and sour cream, I still couldn't eat more then 1/4 of it.So all I will say is beware!If you can't do spicy, don't trust this place at face value. I don't necessarily blame the cashier because she asked a cook if it could be done mild and they said yes. But to me this totally sucked and sorta screwed me out of dinner and $10+"
12,0 STARS! this place seriously is takin over  by a newly fresh don't know what their doing person. They are sooooooo overly priced for a kids size portion and don't over any complimentary chips or salsa especially knowing that their portions are super tiny. I took my food over and asked for my money back because of how disappointing the portion was compared to how much I paid for. My friend and I were in SHOCK. There's a more established Mexican restaurant very perfect service and great portion sizes. DONT GO HERE AVOID
13,"I'd give zero stars if that was possible. Ordered a vegetarian torta. It's more like a overloaded of rajas peppers. with barely any beans, avocado, cheese. Paid almost $10 for a stale tasting bread stuffed with crazy amount of peppers. Very disappointed.Will not be coming back. And save your money, go anywhere but here."
14,Tried the chilaquiles here and it was very disappointing! They tasted like someone just threw some ingredients together. Rather than fry some fresh tortillas they take a few tortilla chips and toss them in some bland salsa that's then topped with scrambled eggs. It was quite expensive and definitely not worth the price you're paying.
15,"Boy, oh, boy was I excited when I entered the restaurant and saw the huge container full of horchata! Usually, this is a sign that the restaurant serves up some pretty good authentic Mexican food. Sadly, this is not the case, here. The beverage was a little peculiar tasting-something was off, and I'm wondering if soy was used as a substitute ingredient. When I read the menu items I was disappointed that carnitas wasn't offered, and settled instead, for some beef enchiladas. Again, this dish was way off-these weren't oven baked enchiladas, but rather a stove top quick assembled and heated version which wasn't anything near the actual traditional dish. The sauce wasn't tasty at all, and the diluted sour cream stuff squirted on top actually ruined the dish even more. For $13 I received 2 enchiladas and a cup full of horchata...no rice, beans, chips, or salsa. I don't intend on returning and don't recommend this restaurant, at all. Some pretty significant changes would have to take place in order for this restaurant to be tolerable. Bottom line : Food is way off."
16,"Tacos are probably my favorite food. It's hard to mess up a taco. But this place manages to not only produce flavorless tacos, but charges at least twice as much as what they should cost. They use high quality meats, but completely ruin it by not seasoning properly. And the salsas are absolutely the blandest, most boring, tasteless excuses for salsa I've ever had in my life. Overpriced, under seasoned, boring, bland, will not be back! Salsa is supposed to be spicy, people! Sheesh. Such a disappointment. Also, salt your stinkin' chips. Tacos have never made me this sad!"
17,"If it'd be possible I'd give this place one star. This was nothing close to Mexican food. I ordered a steak taco and a fish taco, who knew steak was pricier than fish nowadays. My steak taco's ""salsa"" literally tasted like tomato sauce and it was extremely warm for some reason. We also had to pay for chips, and the salsas were not great at all. Fish taco was alright. The food had no flavor whatsoever. I will never return to this place! Paying $10 for two tacos was not worth it."
18,"Overpriced for what you get. Portions need to be larger or prices lower. The food is good, but not worth going twice for."
19,They put BBQ sauce on my carne asada tacos. I just wanted onions and cilantro.The bathrooms are nice though. Come here for the bathrooms. Food is expensive and has BBQ sauce on it.
20,"Terrible. Ordered the Ensalada de Primavera. Took it all the back to my office only to find ROTTING LETTUCE, ROTTEN AVOCADO AND NO SALAD DRESSING. So disappointing. Went all the way back to return it and before I could finish telling them all the things that went wrong, I was cut off by the cashier. Very bad customer service, did not even apologize. Very poor quality control. If you don't believe me, there are 10 pages of 1 star reviews. looks like they just don't care."
21,"I ate here today. While the place feels warm and inviting the food is just blah. I ordered a Torta Al pastor and quite honestly it did not impress me. It was a less than ordinary Torta, beans, meet and a few slices of avocado, for almost $10. Pricey for what you get. It's below average and the people working the register are high school kids that don't know what to recommend. I would​expect that for almost $20, to have a savory Mexican Torta, maybe some chips, but I was informed I had to buy them if I wanted chips. I asked for some salsa to give my plain piece of bread and meat some substance but I was told I had to pay for it. My overall impression from this place is that it feels warm and inviting BUT prices are a little high AND food is below AVERAGE. I'll keep searching for good, savory and authentic Mexican food."
22,"I really don't care for it. It's over-priced for both the quality and the quantity of the dish.I find it almost pretentious for a single crispy taco to cost $3.95, composed as it is of a single tortilla and a measly amount of filling, which in no way is offset by the flavour, or lack thereof, of the item itself, not helped in the least bit by a runny salsa that  almost rivals my terrible run on this sentence.The chicken tortilla soup was not my type, but I can't rate it objectively as I have never really been a fan of mole --- and it tasted like it was based on a mole sauce.I'd rather dine at Picante anyday."
23,"There isn't a salsa selection for the chips. there was a verde and a pico de gallo and they weren't very flavorful. Zero seasoning in the chicken tacos, my son didn't like the steak taco which he said tasted plain. i ordered the tortilla soup, it was super thick and I had to add salt and pepper. It seems like they are scared to use seasoning here. The employees are very nice and I wanted to like this place but I can't justify coming here again and spending $50+ on tasteless food. I came here a few years ago and the food was good. Something has changed since then. Maybe it was just an off night."
24,"Way over salted, over priced tacos. The woman who took my order was exceptionally rude."
25,"Bland food that is very overpriced. $4 street tacos on store-bought tortillas,  $5 elote is just a dried up piece of  charred corn with a blotch of chili powder. Terrible. Found 3 bones in my tiny chicken quesadilla that I could barely cut through. Service is unfriendly. They do have a bathroom which was the only plus as it's hard to find public restrooms anywhere in the Bay Area."
26,"I was passing through when I saw Tacubaya. I ordered the House Specialty dish Chicken Quesadillas with pesto. $9. I left disappointed and hungry after. The portions are very small. It was 2 soft taco shells filled with chicken, cheese, and covered in pesto and radishes. The pesto made it very salty with the cheese. It tasted very bland and had to add a hearty additional amount of Tapatio sauce. Save your money and go to a food truck. Overpriced and small portions are not my thing."
27,"The worst, simply put overpriced fake mexican food."
28,"Very dissapointing meal. Both my husband and I had tacos - fish, pork and chicken between us. They were bland and non-descript - I didn't even finish mine. The guacomole and chips were no better. Lots of chips and a little guacomole - the chips tasted like grocery store bagged chips and the guacomole had way too much lime in it. Don't waste your time or money here."
29,"I feel like this is probably a case of ordering the wrong thing, but I followed the recommendations of my fellow yelpers so I was surprised by how much I really didn't enjoy my meal.  Situated in the beautiful and emerging 4th street Berkeley area Tacubaya is proof of how much looks can be deceiving.I ordered the taco al lengua and taco al pastor, al pastor is always my go-to at Mexican joints and lengua because why not? The lengua was bland and chewy because it was overcooked.  Halfway through my small taco I really didn't feel like eating it anymore [which is saying a lot because I love eating].  The pastor was just okay, the sauce that's included soaked through my tortilla so it was impossible to eat with my hands, a big no no for tacos.  The only saving grace was the diverse and impressive stock of hot sauces, I don't think I could have finished my meal if it wasn't for them.It's not that the tacos are bad because they're really average to below average.  But the fact that they're four dollars each and I can get noticeably better tacos for a dollar down the street makes me know I won't be back.  It's almost criminal the markup they put on the food when you consider the actual quality.  Although I'm sad I didn't get to try the veggie tostada [they were out of stock] it's not worth it to me to play Tacubaya another visit. Kind of a strange side note: the pickled pepper and carrot that come with the tacos were by far the highlight of the meal.  Kind of funny that something so unassuming would be so tasty.Til next time, keep eating keep learning!"
30,"It's clean, a fresh vibe, and had potential...but $16 for two tiny tacos and an elote...no thanks.  I was still hungry.  The quality should have been off the charts for that price, but wrong again.  It was so bland I can't really remember what the tacos were.  Guessing in this part of town you pay up to stay away from Berkeley scum, and get used to boring expensive food?  Coworker got the enchiladas for $8...2 normal tasting enchiladas with nothing else.  Another got the chile releno..look, none of us were talking about the food at all.  There are a few gems we go to for lunch, but this one isn't being put on the rotation.  Bye bye.FYI: what is on our rotation at lunch?  Angelines Louisiana Kitchen (every week), Noodle Theory, Gypsys, Graysons, Southie..."
31,"Nothing special. The salsa verde and pico which come with the chips are flavorless, bland and that is a bad sign for any Mexican restaurant.  If they can't have good salsa then the rest is downhill.   We had the Frijoles, which were good... a bowl of souplike beans which a few fixings, again lacking any authentic flavor.  They did offer a great deal of commercial hot sauces to choose from... but again if I want to flavor my food with commercial hot sauce, then why should I go to a restaurant.  Would not be going back"
32,"If you want to throw down $20 for an overpriced mediocre meal, come here.  $3.75 per vegetarian taco which is literally 2 bites.  Their cucumber lemon water is good though.  The place appears disorganized, one of those open spaces that still feel crammed.  No soaps in the bathroom and when I asked they said, yeah the soap dispenser broke so we don't have soap in there.  Um, gross.  I can't even imagine the germs floating around here...and what about the servers not washing their hands with soap.  Isn't that a violation?Would I come here again? No thanks."
33,"An hour after eating your chicken tacos I spent the next 18 hours feeling nauseous, sweating and throwing up. I now associate you with food poisoning. No bueno. But everyone else in my crew really enjoyed the food."
34,"And in fact, four years later, despite living five blocks away, I have not eaten there since."
35,"Way overpriced. Not authentic. Very bland. And not so friendly staff. We got enchiladas (no rice or beans), soup, and a beer for $25. Wowzers. And still hungry after. Won't be coming back.... Sorry"
36,"Just horrible!!!! Tasteless chicken, soggy chicken tacos... Our plates were completely wet, it was disgusting, fish taco was dry with no sauce... And expensive !!!! Waste of time ."
37,Decided to come here on a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend and the food was indeed different then other Mexican restaurants.  The portions of the food were quite small especially for the price.  It was a bit pricey here for Mexican food.  At least we tried it and now we know that we probably won't be coming back anytime soon.
38,"We went to Tacubaya for a quick dinner on 4th St, Berkeley.  It's from the same owners of Dona Tomas the upscale Mexican restaurant in Oakland.Line can be long here.  Check out the menu on the boards then order & pay at the register.  They will give you an number & bring out the food to you.Don't forget to get silverware from the cashier.  Mine didn't give me any.  Water is self served by the wall where the line is.  I got an Enchiladas plate 8.25.  Just comes with 2 enchiladas shredded Niman Ranch beef & cheese rolled in tortillas & topped w/ guajillo-tomatillo sauce & crema.  Meat was dry and enchiladas as a whole was just ok.  Nothing special here.I got a Horchatta $3.5 - not very good, just ok sweetened rice drink w/ almond & canela.A. got Tamal after they ran out of Tamal de Calabasa, strange.  It was just one single tamale inside shredded pork & mole negro steamed in cornhusks for $5.95.  It looked just ok, I didn't try it.Two unisex bathrooms far right of restaurant.Credit cards taken."
39,"The food was good BUT, the food is insanely over priced! The cashiers were not the friendliest, I told them it was my first time and they were still not too helpful. This place should really be three dollar signs as it is served tapas, or ""side dish"" style (and size), but I would have much rather paid $15 a plate to include sides. The churros were not worth $5.95, and the Horchata was grainy. I paid over $40 for two people and we are now off to find more food as we are still hungry. I will give them the Michelada was good and it is catered with vegetarian options."
40,"Had better. Food is bland, not an authentic mexican food restaurant. Overly priced. We practically threw our food away because it was tasteless, tortillas were not well cooked."
41,Service was fine. Fish tacos were alright. Chips were awful. Completely stale. Lackluster salsa.
42,"After hearing good reviews, we were looking forward to lunch while shopping. Paid $40 for deeply mediocre food, including: greasy, tough, flavorless kid's quesadillas; a sloppy torta de jamon with cold ham and no cheese on stale bread; 3 mediocre tacos, and a plate of rice and beans half-spilled by the waiter. In order to get to the condiments you have to push your way through the line of people waiting to order. Felt like a mall restaurant, which it basically is."
43,"1 star taken for the fact that they split my order: They brought my fish taco about 8 minutes before bringing the steak taco. Restaurant service rule 101, just wait until the order is complete. It's super fun debating whether to let your fish taco get cold while waiting for the other so you can compare flavors or scarfing it down and sitting idly while waiting for 'moar food'. 2 stars taken for very ""blah"" food:The highlight of my meal was the guacamole, great flavor, strong burst of lime, and a balanced hit of heat (I love my guac zesty and spicy, theirs was spot on). Om the downside, the guac was pretty much mashed to a pulp and somewhat 'watery', guacamole should let you enjoy chunks of ripe avocado - but other than that, it's very good nonetheless. Other than the guac, I wasn't impressed, especially for the prices. I had the fish taco and asado taco, both were irreparably bland. Even with two pieces of lime squeezed on the fish tacos, no flavor jumped out; and I was surprised the sauce that comes on the fish tacos was so unfavorable. The beef lacked flavor too, usually the act of searing meat in and of itself is enough to impart some flavor, but not here. Lastly, they make their own tortillas which is nice, but again, no flavor. And all of it could've used ever slightly more salt. I'm guessing since this place serves a pretty yuppie area, they're all about no animal fat, organic this and that, blah blah blah, but when you decide to move classic Mexican favorites upmarket (in price and positioning), you need to execute, and FLAVOR is a key ingredient to success. I won't be going back to Tacubaya, unfortunately for them, there is too much competition from ""regular"" taquerias/taco trucks and upmarket Mexican restaurants in the Bay to have to succumb to overpriced, underwhelming food."
44,"El grave problema= la calidad de la tortilla. Sliding downhill is this longtime Berkeley favorito. Sunday brought a meal at 3:00 PM with a surly cashier, raw tortillas, and food that seemed like it had been cooked on Saturday.  All this despite an open kitchen with busy cooks. The crew seemed demoralized. Even when we returned the tortillas for cooked ones, we still got an unfinished product. The chile relleno was  lifeless, the tacos lacked sabor. Four stars for the aguas. And we used to love this place."
45,"I walked past the restaurant and the aroma caught my attention and made me crave a taco. So I ordered the Taco Al Pastor with spit-roasted Niman ranch pork in adobo marinade with avocado salsa. For $3.65 I asked how many do I get and the cashier said ""one"", so I got some chips and salsa too. The service was spot on but when I got served I thought I got some kid's order; a taco with only some green stuff sparingly on top of the meat. Plus it was similar to a Taco trucks but lacking anything. Honestly, I get more flavor and ingredients paying $1.25 at a taco truck. The chips and Salsa made up for the skimpy taco by a little margin; the salsas are fresh and they didn't skimp on the chips.I am not impressed."
46,"There are at least 40 taco trucks in the East Bay better than this place.  Of course one wouldn't have the same first-world atmosphere of Fourth St. we all love and cherish, but I digress.  The carne asada tacos tasted of pure chili powder adhered to bland, fatless shoe leather.  I'm good with a lot of heat but after eating these I had to find a rest room.  Fast.  I don't know what kind of fish is in the tacos but it's bad-fishy, the exhaust smells from the kitchen confirm it - offensive.  What the heck is wrong with tilapia for tacos - it's mild, plays nicely with taco essential ingredients (once of which is NOT slaw), and doesn't dominate with an off smell.  I get the feeling the Dona Tomas gal is cooking pretty far from her roots here; all the abuelitas of the world are rolling their eyes and my stomach wants bread.  I guess if your reference point is Chipotle-bland you might give this place 5 stars, otherwise it's up-marketed, characterless, poorly balanced food with no star of the show.  Speaking of the tacos here, perhaps there are individual dishes that have some life, but I feel certain the kitchen doesn't know the difference between good, quality ingredients allowed to shine vs. incendiary stomach-cancer inducing heat."
47,"A Graphic Artist living in Berkeley, whom I was visiting, really recommended this Mexican restaurant. I warned her... I'm very critical about Mexican cuisine...On the menu...Chile Relleno (**** $7.50) Description - A Battered and Fried Poblano Chile stuffed with Summer Squash, Spinach, Riccota, and Queso mixto in Tomato Sauce and topped with Cilantro and Crema. The description does not do the stuffing justice - as everything is mixed in an Avocado-colored stuffing which is very subtle and delicate in flavor. Not the best Chile Relleno I've had, but very creative. You would not find a Chile Relleno like this in Mexico... the Hell with authenticism! The value was totally underwhelming...Tamal de Verduras (** $5.95) Description - A Tamal stuffed with Summer Squash, Spinach, Riccota, and Queso mixto and topped with Salsa de Puya, Crema, and Cilantro. I knew that my ordering of a Chile Rellno would result in my starvation this evening... I asked the Register Person if Tacubaya if there were Burritos on the menu... I shouldn't have said Burrito - in fact, if you use ""that"" word, you'll receive a glare from all the employees YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE! What is with the word Burrito? It is a Mexican food item, isn't it? Can someone explain the antipathy towards a Burrito?OK... if you don't like Burrito... let's try a Tamale... er Tamal. The Tamal was not stuffed because the Tamal was not thick enough to stuff in anything. 5 1/2"" x 3"" rectangular in size, it was only about 3/8"" high... how can anything be stuffed into that? Rather, everything was diced and sliced into little slivers and mixed in with the Corn Meal (Masa) or it was folded in the Tamal. And because of the flavor of the Corn Meal which overwhelms any and every flavor... this was one of the blandest Tamals which I have ever had. If you go to your local ""Barrio"" Taqueria - Tamals are less than $1 EACH!Corn Tortillas (**** Complimentary) Steamed, and wrapped in Aluminum Foil... the 5"" round Tortillas could have been the most authentic Mexican part of the evening! Of course, if I wanted more, I would have been charged another arm and another leg....Horchata ($3.50 **) Let's learn how to make this, Tacubaya! My mom used to make this before her passing (bless her heart), and of course she didn't call it Horchata and she used different ingredients to sweeten the drink. The point is that she would always put her mixture through a strainer during the grinding or while the drink was poured. How hard is this?!?!? At Tacubaya, you'll have to drink your Horchata very, very quickly.... or live with all the powdery stuff at the bottom. I'd rather have the restauranteur use a kitchen utensil called a STRAINER! Value (**) Yikes! A Chile Relleno, a Tamale... oops Tamal, forgot this was authentic, upscale Mexican... and an 8oz glass of Horchata = $18.41.  I just love the unintended humor of the juxtaposition of the entrees and utensils... huge utensils to be used with small plates and smaller portions. Some of the attributes I like of Mexican restaurants are the generous portions and familial familiarity - whether authentic or not, it seems Tacubaya has lost those traits.Interesting observation - everyone who was Hispanic was behind the Bar... doing the dirty work...The Mexican restaurants that I frequent are very family-friendly with many Hispanic families out on the weekend - Tacubaya is definitely NOT kind towards groups - from the ordering at the register, and the layout of the restaurant with most of the tables being only the two-person variety and quite a bit of seating at the Bar. In fact, a group of five people ahead of me in line turned right around once they observed the layout and how the ordering worked. This observation might seem a little extreme - the Atmosphere of Tacubaya reminded me of Edward Hopper's painting, ""Nighthawk""- Individuals or Couples seated in a mood of isolation. Maybe the owners of Tacubaya really know their clientele.After leaving Tacubaya... Where's the nearest Barrio Mexican Taqueria? The heck with authentic and upscale and miniscule, I'd be more content with un-authentic and grubby and voluminous... I need some more food!"
48,"I brought my husband here yesterday over his protestations (he's the taco truck king) and he was FLABBERGASTED that we spent $13 for one tiny pork taco, two tiny goat cheese-asparagus quesadillas and a cup of coffee.""Thirteen dollars? Did you say this cost thirteen dollars?"" he couldn't stop saying. LOL we should have gone to Vik's, I guess!"
49,"It was my first time here, highly recommended by my good friend as she's had good experience. You go line up, order and pay then get your number. Cool numbers BTW.I got mine promptly which was ceviche. I had misread it so I asked if this was the scallop special. The food runner told me she did not know what it was in English but she speak great English. So I walked back up to make sure I got what I ordered and sure enough, it was. What was strange was that I got my order before my friend's guac and chips. Halfway through my meal, still hasn't shown up and I'm not a fast eater.The food runner then dropped off the plantains and tortillas then took my friend's number away. We didn't really think about it until I was 3/4 finished with mine. We were basically being patient. But then we noticed the 2 guys behind us got their complete meals so I was like, excuse me, could we have our number back since not all our orders are here. Food runner looked puzzled then looked at the receipt. Meanwhile, the tortilla was getting colder. So were the plantains. STILL NO SIGN OF THE GUAC and CHIPS at this time.FINALLY our orders came only after we brought it up with the same guy at the cash register. There was some mix up blah blah blah. He said he comped my friend's credit card but not sure how much. I'm finished with my meal and they were finally eating theres. Had to bring up for the 3rd time the the GUAC and CHIPS HAVE NOT ARRIVED. One of the orders was chorizo and refried beans. My friend was like, wheres the chorizo, the same guy said it's in there, we've been making this for years yet when I asked the food runner what it was, she said it's just refried beans. I tokk my clean fork and tasted it, tasted no chorizo in it. I took my fork to squeesh it to look for any chorizo pieces, not even the meat granules could be felt with in my mouth. Usually you can. So she brought it up again and I did not appreciate how she was talked to. He was talking down to her. I was so put off. Why did I choose this place? Ugh. Well, I tried it once and this is the last. I'll just go to Cafe Rouge where we've always been appreciated. Churros were super raw doughy in the middle so I couldn't really eat it. Thank goodness the plantains were at least good. Such a disappointing experience for a first time customer."
50,Pricey ... small portions ... service just ok ... I had better mexican restaurants ... and way cheaper !
51,"We just spent $30 here for lunch today for myself, husband and 2 year old son and I definitely feel like we got kinda ripped off.  Fine, I'm sure their using grass fed beef and  organic chicken & veggies but $3.75 for a tiny taco??? I could eat 4 all by myself.  The tacos were tasty but not $3.75 tasty.  Even the veggie version was $3.75.  We also had a $6.75 tamale which was ok, but again not worth it!  Sadly, I don't think we will be back."
52,"I've been to this place twice - once about a year ago, and again today. Last year, I went with my mother. I don't remember what I ordered, it was unmemorable... I remember that my dear mumsy got chicken tacos, because she ended up sending them back. She was sure they were fish. The staff insisted they were chicken - I ended up trying some and I wasn't sure, it was either chicken boiled for waaay too long or some nasty fish. Either way it wasn't good.I went again today, this time with my dear father. What I really wanted was a vegetarian taco, preferably from a taco truck, but that wasn't convenient near 4th St on a Sunday. I tried to order one and the girl was like, we don't do those. So I said well how about I order a meat taco, and instead of the meat you just put some avocado or something in? (Come on, work with me.) Anyway she then suggested I order a side of tortillas and avocado. WTF? She was pretty dismissive. Uh, no thanks to just tortillas and avocado... so I ended up getting a mushroom tostada. It wasn't great. (Also I ended up paying nearly $20 for a single taco, a tostada and two drinks.) If I was wandering around 4th St and getting thirsty I would totally get another horchata, otherwise, I won't be back."
53,"I used to really like Tacubaya, but then they really used to be more flexible about their ordering policy - things like leaving cheese off the tops of beans, and so on - I'm not talking about something complicated like tamales which already have the cheese in the formed masa here! It was awesome that both my omnivorous sweetheart and I could eat here. I loved their tofu divorciados for brunch and the staff was always pleasant. Sadly now they flat-out refuse to leave cheese off of things, which is weird and irritating.Draconian ordering policies + only one vegan non-salad option for dinner = 1 star. Boooo."
54,We arrived at 8:45pm and took a seat. Only to be told at 9pm they are closed. No one said anything they just let us sit there until 9...keep in mind there was not a bunch of people there...
55,"Ah - Tacubaya - how I would love to love you - but you are just not very vegan friendly, are you?  I know it's not your fault that I can't consume legumes, but then - why is it that vegetarians are relegated to beans and cheese as their Mexican vegan options?  I am sad to say that I have given up on you, Tacubaya - my heart belongs to Gracias Madre where I am - at least for now - treated to rich mole sauces, perfectly cooked vegetables, gorditas, empanadas and other delights that you just can't see fit to provide as vegan options."
56,"First off, the girls (cashiers) don't look like they want to be there. Second off, food was disgusting. I ordered two Carne asada tacos and nop, couldn't even finish the tortilla. Seems authentic but I just wasn't diggin the vibes or the food."
57,"Great agua fresca alone can not sustain a place... i'd go back because there were some things that were good (guacamole was on point, but the portion size was way too small for $6) the torta al pastor was mediocre at best... flat flavor, way too much bread for so little meat and avocado (and i think a torta needs tomato, but that's personal preference)good thing there are so many taco trucks around to get tortas and i don't have to rely on Tacubaya..."
58,"Have been wanting to try this place for ages. We finally made it but were a little disappointed.  Chicken taco and fish taco were bland.  Sope de chorizo y papas was the best thing we had and it was pretty tasty.  The ceviche was pretty good, but have had better.  We went in hungry (2 of us)for dinner, spent $40 with dessert and were not quite full when we left.  Might try it again sometime if we are in the area, but won't go out of our way."
59,"I think someone needs to crane-game this b*tch up and drop it somewhere on Fruitvale. Seems as though being on 4th street for so long has skewed your perception of acceptable: $4 for 1 taco and $1.75 for a *can* of soda? Seriously?I mean what; was the soda delivered to you in a golden van, by a golden man, with a golden hand truck? Nope, probably from Costco.Anyway. Probably wont be back. $th street scares me as does the lady standing on the corner singing folk music with all the wind chimes."
60,"I'm worried Tacubaya is slowly going down in quality. This used to be such a good place but lately it's been less and less fresh and tasty. For the first time ever there I had a meal I had to return, a tortilla soup!, it was simply inedible (cardboard hard tortilla chips in the soup...) , which is a shock, that soup was always such a sure shot and so fresh and delicious. They changed it and what they gave me was ok, the chicken was really not super fresh either.... Bummer... I really like the staff there and I had some wonderful meals at Tacubaya over the years, so I hope they right the ship... Otherwise I'll take it this out of my regular rotation and go to Picante even more often..."
61,"This place wasn't bad, wasn't great... We were hungry. It really did not stick with me because I actually do not remember what I ate!  I recall my friend leaving half of her dish behind. Getting a seat is a pain in the arse. The prices are RIDICULOUS considering that you have to go to a counter and order.  Their prices are for a full service restaurant, not a fancy taqueria.  Dude, just go to a taco truck... it will be more memorable. The should get 1star max, but due to the fact they stay open later than everything else in the area... they get the 2nd star."
62,"This place is a joke. Looking at the menu I noticed it was expensive, but you figure you are on 4th Street, so that's par for the course. Then I asked if I could get the enchiladas with just cheese instead of beef and cheese, and the cashier said no! EXCUSE me? You've got to be kidding. That points to only one thing- the enchiladas (and who knows what else) are made ahead of time. I'm sorry, but that is just unimaginable. You are a mexican restaurant in the bay area and you don't make enchiladas to order? Shame on you. I ended up getting a seasonal special, asparagus quesadillas. They were way too small for the price and nearly flavorless.  My red rice was just as bland. My lunch mate got a tiny little taco, nothing special, and the flavor was pureed out of the black beans. The only redeeming item on the menu were the churros. But I'm not sure I'd want to support this place and their lame practices just for them. This place has a 4 star rating? Come on yelpers, get it together."
63,Sucks for takeout. They make you wait in a twenty minute line just to pick up preordered items!The food is ok but poor for the cost.
64,"Went here for a quick dinner (at 4:30pm) yesterday. The place was empty and yet I waited, and waited, and waited to order. When I asked if one of the dishes could be made without onions, I was told NO...everything was all mixed together already. So, right off the bat, I was stuck with a long wait to order and the promise of  reheated pre-made food to look forward to...Yikes.I settled on the enchiladas, which could not be made without the beef (I just wanted cheese) and a mango agua fresca. For $8.50, I expected rice and beans to come with the enchiladas. Nope. Those things were $3 extra. And call me cheap, but I HATE when places charge for chips and salsa. I was out $13.50, and only had a small glass of agua fresca and two wimpy enchiladas to show for it. Boooooo, Tacubaya."
65,"Got take-out from here with some co-workers for lunch. The wait wasn't too long, which was good, but for something on Fourth Street, I was expecting better.I got the Fideo (Mexican pasta with cotija cheese, vegetables, and tomato sauce) because I was in a carb-y mood. It tasted fine but just very underwhelming. I love cotija cheese and expected lots and lots of it in the Fideo, but there wasn't more than a quarter size amount on top of the pasta. What.Also, there were around 10 tiny pieces of carrot, and that was it on the vegetable end. I finished the meal in about 5 minutes, because there was so little to eat. $8 poorly spent.Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I don't think I'll be coming back here."
66,"Uhm....I've been a regular customer here for the last 5 years.  For the most part, I've loved the food, which has been reliably solid, good fresh ingredients, etc.  However, I had the unfortunate experience of starting to dig into a spring salad and discovering a long black hair about 6 inches long or so among the lettuce.  That was last year, and I've struggled to forget it.But my experience at Tacubaya a few days ago has pushed me over the line.  When ordering I was informed that they were out of chicken tacos, out of pork tacos and a few other things.  WTF.  how could a tacqueria not serve chicken tacos!?I ordered some other things, that were so, so, (soup unevenly heated (microwaved?) and tortillas that were old and leathery), and THE KICKER IS... that at the bottom of a large spring salad I shared with my partner, we discovered a thick larvae, about an inch long, that's right...LARVAE...as in a baby bug chilling out in the bottom of my bowl!  Needless to say, we asked for and were granted a FULL REFUND for our meal.  But I became nauseous and had to run to the facilities after finding the thing.  I wish this wasn't true, but I don't think I can bring myself to eat here again.  Really disappointed and disgusted!"
67,"very rarely (like maybe almost never?) do I let a rude social experience keep me from going back to an eatery . . . today's minuscule social ruderie (yeah, I just made that up) will give me pause the next time I'm on 4th St. shopping. Because? There's quite a few other options in this part of town, and I also just saw that Vics moved to a nicer, bigger building a jump down the road from their original location. . . that said--- I got in line, maybe 3 deep? But, the place was PACKED. You know, it's a rainy Saturday, so that's to be expected. I was not perturbed by this at all. It never occurred to me that I might not get a seat. I was a singleton. So, I'm trying to make up my mind, the line was moving, and I did a quick scan behind me, and saw the big communal table right next to the cashier counter, completely open up-like maybe 8 seats? So, quickly, I lay down my umbrella and small shopping bag, right in front of the far seat by the line queue. I was up next to order, so I'm turning around every few seconds, seeing that my stuff doesn't get taken. Not that I expected it to . . . I order, turn around, and see this young mother, and her 4ish year old daughter, move my umbrella & bag, away from my seat. I was slack jawed with awe--I mean I had JUST LAID DOWN MY STUFF MAYBE, OH WHAT? 10 SECONDS BEFORE? So, I walk over, casually say ""that was my stuff you just moved, I was sitting there"" AND SHE OH SO RUDELY SAYS: ""well you can't put your stuff down to save a spot before you order"". I say ""oh really?"" she says ""it's known that you can't do that here"". I was going to go off, but then thought--really?? REALLY?? There were about 2 other open seats to this communal table left, and I almost just sat down in one of them. But, I would have had to have this b*tch looking right in my face, and I avoid sitting next to potential kidlets who might have manner-issues (this is Berkeley after all) so I just picked up my stuff, and walked away. I found a seat at the bar almost instantly, and I turned to see if the lady was watching. She and her husband (who just joined her) and kid were all happily munching away on their food. So, my 2 stars is for the atmosphere that this place generates. It really is a problem. Not for me--no, I may not go back for, oh, well ever, but really? You can't set your belongings down on an open seat/table if you haven't waited in the slow moving line and paid for your food yet??? Really? The Berkeley Seating Police (this woman might just be chief-in-charge) must just have a field day at this establishment. This must just happen all the time---?? Because, I've never ever ever encountered someone who purposefully, rudely, imposes her desire to seat herself, over public manners. If I hadn't been so astonished at this occurrence, I might have wapped her over the head with my umbrella and chased her out of my seat! Heh. not really. But wouldn't that have been a sight?"
68,"It was a very good experience for me environment-wise, very authentic and lively. We had to wait awhile in line but that is understandable. Ordered fish tacos, and there wasn't a very long wait to receive your food. The chips and guacamole they served were outstanding! When I received my food, I got up to look for salsa, but could only find hot sauce. I asked the cashiers, who said I had to order some. I got back in the very long line to order salsa. After spending 15 minutes in line and $1.64 on a thing of salsa (the rest of my family was almost done eating by this point) they gave me a number. More waiting for salsa? They couldn't have grabbed a salsa from right next to them?? Went back to my chair with the number and after 10 minutes of waiting for a pack of salsa I asked a waitress, who then proceeded to bring it 5 minutes later. The tacos were delicious, but then I found A PIECE OF PLASTIC in the taco!! Overall a moderate experience and they need to put in a free salsa bar next to the hot sauce."
69,"The fish taco was horrible. It was soggy, falling apart and tasted way too fishy (in a bad way). No bueno."
70,"Two stars because food is edible. Asked for more salsa for tacos and they said "" we   don't have salsa"" somewhat ironic that on their menu they sell chips and salsa.  A mexican restaurant without salsa!!!! Place is overpriced and not a good value.."
71,"""Small"" is the executive word here. The food is ok, very gringofied.  If the kitchen was not in plain view, I'd have guessed that Rachael Ray was the one cooking.The guy behind the register had the condescending attitude that is so commonly found in Berkeley.  Typical college student who can't abide to his role as a cashier, because he thinks the world owes him something better.  Don't buy any of the cooking stuff they have on display, the tamarindo pulp, the hot chocolate.  The prices are bordering extortion.  Any decent Mexican market will have the same items and more at half the price.And speaking of authentic: Tapatio Hot Sauce was nowhere to be found.  I have worked in the wine industry for a long time, which as you know heavily relies on Mexican work forces, and in every break room I have visited in wineries all over the state you find Tapatio.  That's the one with the mariachi on the label.  That's the real deal, not that Cholula crap, I don't care what Brian Wilson says."
72,"Went here today for lunch with some of my friends. The food was mediocre. I ordered the the primavera salad which wasn't anything special. One of my friends ordered the tortilla soup and another got the tacos. The soup seemed to be the best entree out of everything we had ordered. It was a pretty big size, the tacos on the other hand were small and there was barely any meat in them. This place was worth trying but I will probably not go back to it."
73,"I have been here several times. The food seems fresh and looks yummy but my experience is that it just doesn't taste good. I had the menudo last weekend, it was bitter and way smokey tasting, not to my liking. I have had several of the other dishes and I am just not a fan of the taste of their food. My girlfriend likes it so we go back but I dunno I just don't. I grew up eating Mexican food so I am familiar. I like Dona Tomas which I think is owned by the same people."
74,"OK, you LOST OUR ORDER. Don't expect you to comp my meal, but how about an extra taco or some guac on the house?!?!? And your water refill station is blocked by customers waiting in line during busy periods. FAIL!I'm starting to think that Fourth Street restaurants are Berkeley's culinary shameful secret: non chain establishments with chain restaurant quality.I wouldn't refuse to go there again, but I'll never suggest it or want to return."
75,"Despite the other great reviews, I have to say that I was disappointed with Tacubaya. I thought the food was overpriced and honestly, just didn't taste good. My boyfriend and I ordered all the tacos on the menu and we were unimpressed with all of them. Maybe we've been spoiled by living in Southern California, but I think there are other delicious, less expensive Mexican options in the same area. The service was good but our experience was overall disappointing."
76,Over priced for such wimpy servings.  I'd rather spend my money at Picante or go to Primavera at the SF Ferry Building Farmer's Market and get three times the serving for the same price and have it taste better.
77,"I was really hoping this place would satisfy my mexican craving, but sadly it did not meet my hopeful expectations! I tried the pork tacos which seemed good from other reviews, but it was just disappointing. The taco was so small and the pork in such tiny shreds. It wasn't flavorful enough and was too watery. The carne asada taco wasn't much better.The chips and guacamole were okay, but the chips were kind of stale and the guacamole slightly watery. If you charge higher prices for you food, you better deliver on the quality and flavor!"
78,"The food is good. Portions small. The employees: reticent, no enthusiasm. More into each other than the customers."
79,"This place used to be great. I used to go often-- until I moved away. Today i traveled 50 miles (1 hour) to have breakfast there. The cafe de olla I was served had a hair in it. No apology from the woman manager about this. I tasted the cafe the olla and it was nowhere near as good as it used to be a few years ago. Then I tried the corn tortillas and tamale and they tasted weird, like the dough had gone bad or was old. Again, nobody apologized, nobody tried to correct the situation. I am Mexican and grew up with corn tortillas and tamales, so I KNOW what the corn dough/masa in them is supposed to taste like. Bad food, bad service, worst manager ever! I am not wasting my time or money in this restaurant."
80,"i dont understand how people come here, but I guess 4th street shops arent really there for the average college student. the food is really expensive (at least for only average mexican food) and the portions are ridiculously small."
81,"I tried this place today and ordered Frijoles con Todo  ($8) and Churros ($6).  The Frijoles soup arrived unheated and the Churros were undercooked and the inside was gooey, and inedible.  I guess I could have stood in line again and asked both items to be recooked, but I really didn't have the time.  The only thing that was good was the tortillas."
82,"I think I've come here three times in the last three or four years and every time I have been completely underwhelmed.  Why three times, you ask?  Well, I guess I get forgetful after a year goes by....and every time I go to 4th Street (at least twice a month), it is lunch time and I can smell great smells coming out of the place.  My bad....The first time I had a ceviche that was more akin to a mild curry...couldn't find the fish/seafood in it AT ALL.  Now I am all for new spins on old favorites, but how about some warning.  It's foreseeable that someone who orders ceviche is looking for a light citrus-y seafood-y dish...call me crazy....That was either the first or second time I went.  Whatever I had the other of those two times was underwhelming enough for me to forget what it was.Last weekend, we were tricked by the yummy smells and the always-full dining room into going again.  I had some special, I think.  It was an enchilada with chicken....and I'm not kidding I can't remember what else because it was so bland!  The waiter put the plate down in front of me and there were two small light colored corn tortillas (the tortillas were good btw) and a similar colored sauce and filling.  I fear that I could not hide my disappointment when he put it in front of me -- it just looked so sad!  I tried it, though, and bland bland bland.  I think its a sign when everything in the dish is off white, we're not off to a good start.  My fiance had the carne asada and al pastor tacos.  I was envious...I figured those would have been safe bets since I've never had any that suck anywhere (even the kosher ones back in LA at Jose Bernstein's  have been GREAT!).  No such luck for him either.  They were ""okay"" without very much in the way of spice and the meat was not very flavorful either.The two pluses -- no complaints about service.  And the tortillas tasted fresh.People seem to complain about the price.  It doesn't really bother me and definitely wouldn't bother me if I liked the food.  But guess what?!  3 strikes and you're OUT!!!!!!!"
83,"I was going to let it slide but this stomach ache will not stand!1. no burrito, nada. none.2. NOT a taco shop, try american fusion with a hint of mexico3. was that Mayonnaise on the fish taco?4. Tortilla tastes like rubber."
84,"I've been to plenty of restaurants that won't substitute ingredients, and I get that, but never to one that REFUSES to simply leave off an item...until today at Tacubaya. It was explained to me that if the ingredient were left off, the dish would be too plain & simple (which didn't make sense b/c there are plenty of plain & simple dishes on the menu).  Being a vegetarian means having to get creative with menus offering very limited veg selections, like Tacubaya's. Won't be supporting a business that extends such a lousy customer service policy and narrow food selection."
85,"The aroma and prominently displayed 'Vino' sign is all that warrants adding a star to the otherwise 1/2 star rating.  The foreplay should have scared us off..  2 of the 6 wines they were out of, and 5 items on the menu were sold out as well.  But as any good smell will do to you, we pressed on.Half a spoon of guac,  bowl of tortilla chips with a wayward slice of RAW  BEEF slinking underneath? Check.  And yes,  we said Raw beef  in our bowl of chips!    Lack of enthusiasm or care that raw piece of beef was in said chips? Check.   Stares and murmurs from staff as if to suggest we were being a little high maintenance for not eating that freshly slaughtered cow?Check.  I guess I didn't know it was a mexican sushi place."
86,I love this place by far my favourite mexican restaurant. I'm so bummed that i ate there yesterday and got really sick. :(
87,"For starters the place is cute. Great location in the 4th St hood. We walked up to order our food and the prices seemed reasonable (considering the location). No burritos! My Man was not happy. We ordered got our cute loteria card number and found a seat outside (which meant we could not get alcohol, which is restricted to being consumed indoors). The Food: - Chips & Guac: Ha! What a joke they should call this chips and 3 tablespoons of guac. My man loves guac so he was desperately trying to make the guac last until the food came. Not to mention when we asked for salsa we were told we had to go back and purchase it. This means no salsa for the tacos not to mention if it is the same serving as the guac it is not even worth it! - Sope de Chorizo con Papas: the best thing we had hands down. It was greasy and yummy. - Taco de Pollo: BLAND. The chicken is not seasoned and since the shell is crispy just adding pico de gallo on top makes it soggy and even blander. Oh, and what kinda Mexican place doesn't serve radishes with the tacos? Answer: This one! - Taco de Pastor: was good but not amazing. - Taco de Carne Asada: It was good. That is all just good. Would have maybe approached great if it included salsa and radishes. - Frijoles Negros: of course served on the side because everything is an extra. Well they were good but not fabulous. - Tamale de Chocolate Chips w/Strawberry Compote: come on our family's are the kings of tamale making. For a sweet tamale this just doesn't cut it! - Churros: barely a step up from Costco churros. Actually come to think of it Costco is better. - Cafe de Olla: not really from an olla but apparently they add some syrup to give it the flavor, this means that it is only good for the first half a cup. Glad I tried something new but I definitely will not come back. For these prices I am better off making the track to Colibri in SF much , much better and worth the price. Not to mention all the salsas you want!!!"
88,"This place is fine only if it convenient to be at. It is incredible expensive for what you get $3.45 for one small taco that does not include chips and salsa?! I'm afraid to say it just does not taste good. It is very bland, boring and way too expensive. One tamale is six bucks. One tamale! The service is beyond slow and they don't seem to mind ..or care. Once the order is in the food does arrive promptly. However, if you need anything additional, the waitstaff does not speak any English forcing you to cut in line and request from the cashier what you need. It is definitely not worth the price or the experience."
89,"So we went back, with out-of-town friends in tow, and not only were they out of virtually everything (what the hel kind of respectable mejican establishment runs out of pork. and enchiladas), but the food service was SO. FRIGGIN'. SLOW. I toyed seriously with the idea of going next door to the Pasta Shop, and getting a snack to tide us over while waiting for our food. AND... this is a major 'AND'... the 'kitchen' which is front and center, all exposed, was disgusting. I thing the whole point of having the 'open kitchen' is the pride in your food prep and cleanliness, which I guess they didn't get here.Once we got our food, it was some kind of tasty, esp the black beans."
90,Im guessing breakfast isn't their thing. First time I've spent $10 at a Mexican food place and left hungry. Coffee was really good but kinda pricey for a small portion if eggs and black beans.
91,"It pains me to give this restaurant 2 stars when when 4 years ago I would have given it at least 4 stars.  Has their food quality went down or have my standards/taste buds changed?  I'm not sure.  What I do know is that I ate here a few days ago and the meal was not worth the money I paid.  Actually, I'm not sure I'd call it a meal.  Both me and my partners meals were more like appetizers.  Tis tis.  The chicken in the chicken tacos was horrific!  It was hard as a rock from having been fried with the taco shell.  Not to mention the tacos themselves being microscopic.  Both the green and red salsas were bland and watery.  The chips were stale.  The black beans looked and tasted like baby food (Why not whole black beans?)  My chili relleno was decent.  I ordered it because instead of just cheese, it was stuffed with squash.  The relleno itself was huge but it didn't come with beans or rice, just a huge relleno on a huge plate.  It would have been nice to have beans and rice on the side to compliment the relleno.  Instead, they gave me a basket full of homemade soft tortillas.  The tortillas were good.  Overall the portion/price ratio lacked congruency.  They're giving you 2-3 star portions and tastes with 4-5 star prices.  The experience was definitely a bit yuppie and hyped for me.  This place has lost a once proud customer.  P.S. Back in 2004 this restaurant sold me with its tortilla soup.  I used to crave it.  I didn't have it this last time I went.  It might still be good.  I will never know."
92,"I had a serious craving for some Mexican food the other night. I jumped on Yelp from my phone and found this place. I was in a rush and didn't read any of the reviews - I only saw the 4 stars and thought score! I soooo regret not reading some of the reviews:( So here's what we got: 1 Crunchy Chicken Taco, 1 Steak Taco, 1 Pork Taco, 1 Tamale, Child Quesadila (which consisted of a small corn tortilla folded in half with cheese) Guac/Chips. Total Price = $28. Are you serious? After dropping damn near $30 on some tacos, my expectations were pretty high. Sadly, the food was average at best. I've definitely experienced just as good (if not better) and paid a fraction of the price at some local taco trucks. On a higher note, the pork had really good flavor - so I decided to give an extra star."
93,"The food here is alright.  But if you're really in the mood for some authentic Mexican, be sure to bypass this place.  Think Baja Fresh with an organic and classier face.    This place is also WAY overpriced for the portions."
94,"It's on 4th street, so you know what to expect...sorta. My friend veggie tamale was wonderful, but my tostada of my sope de chorizo was too tough, and it was too messy to eat properly. The melon agua fresca wasn't overly sweet - a plus. Service was fast and friendly. But! I don't care where you are, and how much your rent is. $2.50 for chips and salsa, when the chips are stale and you get two little to-go cups of very uninteresting red and tomatillo sauces is shameful. In fact, it's ballpark-food-price shameful."
95,"Stuck-up, sense of entitlement for every last flake of cilantro - this establishment out-right should fail due to their level of service.We spent over $40 dollars for just a few items, however that was a table full of food. I asked the wait staff three times for (quite literally) a ""pinch of queso"" no more than a size of a US quarter coin to put atop by menudo. Finally - after the fourth time asking, the wait staff turned to one of the management and asked if it was OK, and the woman who works behind the register, who just so happened to sit next to us, and clearly saw the table of food we just ordered, exclaimed ""NO!"" We charge for such additional items, like cheese.Let me be very clear - I was not asking for a bowl of cheese, literally, just a pinch of queso / cheese to top my menudo.With this entitlement attitude, this restaurant deserves to fail. My family will speak ill of this establishment amongst our circles for friends, both professional and personal."
96,"We were craving tacos and looked for a place close by and saw that this place had good ratings without really examining the reviews so we opted to come here...  This is one of the times I felt duped by Yelp ratings.  When we arrived, the lines were crazy long, so I was hoping it would be really good, the food was okay but totally not what I was expecting.  We had ordered ceviche, tacos, and some other things I was surprised to see at a taqueria like potato cakes... and I was right to be surprised, this definitey is not a taqueria, lol.  The ceviche was totally different than what i was used to and the tacos were just okay."
97,"Generally food is very good quality although it is pricey for Mexican non gourmet Mexican. They charge for chips and salsa and quite frankly the salsa is not that good. The Pozole is tasty but barely has any meat. On the flip side, they serve one of  my favorite Mexican brunches around, the handmade tortillas are to die for and their huevos nortenos are excellent.I am giving them two stars because service is terrible. After eating more than a dozen times I finally gave up. The women working the registers are rude and unhelpful, more often than not they wont look at you while they take your order. After you place your order they bring the food to the table but very frequently they bring the food out one item at a time, good luck if you have kids  or your table has more than two people. It is a shame that service is so bad because Tacubaya has potential to be truly great."
98,"2.5 stars on those days when I'm in a good mood....Pros:1) Nice atmosphere.2) Convenient location if you want to hang out in the Fourth Street area.3) Fresh, mostly locally produced ingredients.4) The veggie black beans were good.Cons:1) The comments about the tasteless, dry chicken in the tacos is right on.  Gross, gross, gross.2) The fish taco was okay, but nothing to go nuts about.3) My dining companion said the hot chocolate was not impressive at all.4) It is too pricey for very much just okay Mexican food.5) The food at Picante is way better and worth the money."
99,"I heard wonderful things about this place.  I order - it's crappy, skimpy and, ""salsa please"", they tell me, you'll have to buy it!  I think you just lost a customer.  I bought a tamal and a torta - $14.00 and could not get a little salsa?  No thanks - won't be back.  The torta was crap and I do mean CRAP - poorest excuse for a torta I have ever seen.   The tamal - just ok but $3.50???  come on?  I think they do put crack in their food but it is not to get you addicted - it is so they can charge through the nose?  Pardon the pun for those of you who snort your crack!!!"
100,"wow. I was super shocked at the service and the food here. I ordered two tacos. One was indeed delicious taco pescado). The second taco I ordered, a carne asada, came in the form of a white, fried mushy meat. it was tasteless and shockingly bad. when I told the manager I got the wrong order and what I ate was horrible, he cared more about arguing with me than accepting the complaint and trying to figure out what wnet wrong. The other person at the register was even more rude, trying to tell me off and shooting me bad vibes and looks. They did not care that what they served me was 1) not what I ordered and 2) bland, mushy, and strange. I have eaten at many restaurants and have never, ever gotten that kind of rude infuriating service. hope the owners are reading this review."
101,"Being way overpriced and small portions combine to make this one place I'll never visit again. Woop di do they make they're own tortillas who cares. My enchiladas were nothing special and my friends lengua tacos were overcooked and grossly overpriced. I'm having a hard time finding good mexican in Berkeley. I guess the further you get from the border the worse the food gets, oh well guess I'll keep trying places."
102,"Ate here a few times.  Good food, small portions, and over priced.  You like a cafeteria atmosphere then you should come here."
103,"Yuk. Left a very bad literal and figurative taste in several mouths.After forging through a long line and encountering an entirely rude cashier who snippily informed me that there were no substitutions, I ordered the chicken fajita with a salsa verde, for something like $7.95. What I got were two oily tasteless corn tortillas, neither soft nor crisp, filled with bland and pretty awful-tasting shredded chicken and some jack cheese, in a puddle of nondescript salsa verde. Nothing else on the plate, and entirely unapetizing-looking. And tasting. I could not finish it and ended up going next door to the salad bar in the deli for a delicious salad (o why did I not start and end there?)Two friends got the sope with pork and potatoes and liked it pretty well. Another friend got refried beans and rice, which we all agreed was awful. We all shared guac and chips - average, and a meager portion for the price. Why is this place so popular? I am mystified and won't be back."
104,"OK, so I have been craving tacos all day.  I was cursing the fact that I work in Richmond and not able to go to the Mission for a tasty beef taco.  Lunch time rolls around...my co-worker and I were just going to grab a sammich from a place near the office when someone says, ""Hey!  We're going to 4th Street to get some tacos!""  I was all like, Yay!  TACOS!We go and there is a little bit of a line, but hey, it's lunch time and it's motha fuckin' TACOS.  I order and take my bottle of Coca-Cola and wait for my tacos.  My dining partners all got theirs pretty quickly.  Mine arrived, and it was the wrong thing.  I wait another couple of minutes (5 or 10...I was so hungry that I couldn't keep track), and they brought 1 taco.  I ordered 2.  When I told the guy that brought it, he sighed, looked at me, and walked away.  Another 10 minutes pass, and I get my other taco.  That was after getting 'tude from the hipster kid when I asked if they forgot about it.That was about 2 hours ago and I am hungry again.  Poo :("
105,"Hmmm...surely one of the worst Mexican food experiences of my life.  And I grew up in Connecticut.My wife and I rolled up into this place after surveying the options on 4th street.  We ordered three tacos: pastor, chicken, and fish, and the pastor torta, and one horchata.Down the line:Never have I had such flavorless shredded chicken.  Perhaps it was poached in distilled water.  Even a little salt would have helped.The fish taco was ok ... it was slathered in creamy baja-style sauce turned the crispy fried breading into a soggy mess.The quality of meat used for pastor was high; however, they managed to marinate it for all those hours without infusing any flavor at all.  Flavorless pastor is unforgivable!Upon finishing our meal we realized that we hadn't had an ounce of salsa fresca, verda, rojas, or otherwise.  Unbelievably, every item we ordered was sin salsa.  And as others have already mentioned there is no salsa bar.The atmosphere is nice, the service friendly -- but at these prices the food should have been waaay better.We'd have done better at a taco truck.  I won't be going back."
106,"I ate here over two weeks ago, and yet I still feel slightly robbed of my hard earned cash. Granted, $20 isn't much in the bigger picture, but for a quesadilla, enchilada, a small plate of rice, and an iced coffee, I feel robbed. Sure, that sounds like a lot of food, but c'mon, this is Mexican food. At my local Mexican joint, I could get three times as much food for the same price that tastes a million times better. The quesadilla was so small that my bf could barely tell what was in it. My enchilada was slightly larger, but I didn't like the sauce on top. Personally, I think my ghetto Chinese take on enchiladas is better. I just can't wrap my mind (or wallet) around paying more than $2 for a taco that I can make at home."
107,"Overpriced. Overrated. Over it. Well, the Taco al Pastor (pork) and Agua Fresca (kiwi) were delish ... I'll give it that. One of my goonies suggested that Tacubaya had the best Chile Rellenos, so I had to bring the wifey there. Even though I was starving I should of seen the red flags ... yuppy neighborhood with yuppy stores. This can't be authentic can it?I order the Torta w/ carne asada, a fish taco, a pork taco, a steak taco, and a Agua Fresca and I swear I wasn't high. The wifey ordered the Chile Rellenos while my friend ordered steak tacos, guacamole w/ chips and a Modelo. The total was around $45 but  the taste was worth about $14.92 ... like Columbus when he pillaged the natives.The steak had a foul aftertaste. The fish taco was decent. Chile Rellenos looked tasty but lacked flavor. And for the price we pay we can't get some free chips!??!?!  Straight up on some Columbus sh*t.  Yeah, they might use organic products and Niman Ranch meat but if it don't taste good what's the use?."
108,"We ordered the chicken tortilla soup, and a fish taco.  The soup looked delicious, the broth was tasty, but it had tons of tortilla chips, some shredded chicken, a little avocado and little else, no cilantro, onion, or anything else to cut the greasy tortilla chips.  The fish taco, a tiny bit of battered fish, with cabbage and a spoonful of heavy mayo sauce; not very good.  I took off one of the corn tortillas (served with two) and just ate it with one.  They are fairly thick.  You could not taste the fish."
109,"A. won't be happy with the review because he thought this place was the best. His tamale was delicious, had I ordered this dish my review would be completely different! He also had the chicken taco which he liked, but not as much as he loved the tamale..I, on the other hand, ordered the ceviche.. When I think about it I want to cringe. I ate it because I was starving, but if you're a big fan of ceviche DO NOT order.. The fish; I think it was salmon was swimming in this super sweet red sauce. The mango was a nice touch but it was overpowered by the terrible red sauce. I also ordered the Taco de Asada, the meat was dry and it was just ok - nothing to write home about. I'll most likely come back because A. will crave the tamale.. I may have to update my review then, but until that happens I give Tacubaya a solid 2."
110,"Absolutely disappointed. The fish dip my mother ordered was way too salty and sour. Also, the enchiladas were too sour as well. The only good dishes they have there are the tacos and that isnt even that good. My dinner would have been better going to a taco bell or a chipotle. For desert, I was pleased to see an actual mexican churro, but that too tasted like something out of a box. I was very displeased."
111,Microscopic tacos.  Average food.  Sticky tables and chairs.
112,"Their website describes Tacubaya as ""an upscale taqueria"". We have had much better meals in any one of the taquerias in San Rafael and they do not make that claim. It starts with the surly lady at the cash register. It is as if she is doing a favor by taking your order and money.Although it was on their board, they were out of Taco de Lengua. Sopa de Tortilla had no flavor. None! No chicken flavor, no chile flavor. None! Same for the taco. No flavor at all.Our Guacomole and Chips had been sitting on the counter for so long that the chips had gotten soggy. We waited more than 20 minutes for our meal and the chips must have been sitting on the counter with the guacomole.And, the place is very very dirty. Our clothes were sticking to our chairs from the gunk on the chairs. Same for the table tops. My husband noticed that there were chips and other burned matter all over the cooking surfaces."
113,"I have a hard time stomaching a $40 tab for passable Mexican food for four people, one of whom had the appetite of Nicole Richie.  Having said that, I can't argue with the open air seating fit for pooches and the temperate climate so welcoming of San Franciscans escaping the fog.  The ceviche was a bit on the tart side, even with the salty tortilla chips they're paired with.  The enchiladas made with Niman Ranch shredded beef, though good, are hard to justify at almost $8."
114,"I loved Dona Tomas in my lacto-ovo vegetarian days and was hoping that Tacubaya would be my new, cheaper crush, especially on days off after blowing money at Anthropologie, Benefit, and Aveda. But no-I've been twice and the place has failed to wow me.Maybe it's the price but if I'm going to pay almost $7.00 for a mediocre vegetarian torta I expect to feel the way I do after paying the same amount for a sando at New World Vegetarian. The refried black beans didn't have much taste. The torta was also stuffed with a few slices of avocado and some grilled peppers and onions (which were good). But I have to agree with Scott A. (my dining companion) more bread than filling. During my previous visit I had the soup, basically black beans, good but not stellar.I like that the place has a decent amount of vegetarian dishes, some that can be made vegan. But from here on out I'll just stick to shopping on 4th street."
115,"I went here under the pretense of great food, as promised by the many 5 star reviews left in praise of Tacubaya.  Instead I left wondering if I had made it to the right place, thinking I had found the wrong restaurant.I first noticed that the menu was very limited, it offered tacos, tamales, and a few other general items but not any sort of array you would normally see at a normal Mexican restaurant.  Upon ordering my wallet cried as I dished out nearly 4 dollars for ONE taco.  Drinks were separate, and lo and behold you have to pay extra for chips and salsa.  That is an automatic no for a Mexican restaurant.When I got my food I was appalled to see that the tacos were one three inch corn tortilla with less than a tablespoon of meat, a few strands of cheese and a pinch of lettuce.  That is no exaggeration, the portions are TINY.  Not to mention I had to get everything myself, for that price and size I would normally expect waiter service, drink refills, etc.The food was mediocre.  If you're looking for real, authentic Mexican food do not come here.  It tastes completely fake, the tortillas are dry, the salsa is bland, and they skimp on everything.  But if you're going for Berkeley yuppie style Mexican food then this is your place, perfect for people who want to think they're eating Mexican food.Do yourselves a favor and go somewhere else, there are plenty of other Mexican food places in Berkeley that actually work and deserve your money.  If you have money to throw to stuck up cashiers, over priced bland food then you can go to Tacubaya."
116,"Food is okay.  Food prices are very high for what you get.  $3.55 for a half-ounce or so of beef sprinkled with an ounce or so of salsa (salsa is a bit of tomato, a bit of chili pepper, maybe onion, a little water. .. how much does an ounce or so of tomato, chili, onion cost?) and then two tiny tortillas. . . I know a restaurant exists to make money and I realize they pay someone to make the tortillas, sprinkle the stingy amount of food on the tortilla . . . at the most, the restaurant spends fifty cents on ingredients, maybe another fifty cents on labor and, being generous here, let's assess fifty cents per taco for insurance and rent for the real estate . . . . . . I happily pay three fifty for tacos but tacubaya tacos are a rip off. I want to actually taste two whole bites of meat if I am forking over three fifty for one taco.I don't get this place. I had to wait a long time to place my order and there were two women ahead of me and two cashiers. Once I ordered, the food came soon enough, what little there was of it.I overpaid for a 'carne asada' taco.  I have eaten a carna asada taco at a million different Mexican joints in my time.  My favorite taco is carnitas but I like to try a carne asada taco when eating at a Mexi place for the first time cause carne asada is grilled beef:  easy, standard. Grilled means grilled. But the weirdo carne asada taco I just had was sweet:  they must put some sweet sauce on their meat when they grill it?  I have never had sweet goop on a grilled beef taco before. . .and the menu did not indicate that the chicken taco would be deep fried but it was. I expect a 'taco' to be soft, esp. when the menu references the two homemade tortillas . .. if you are going to go to the trouble of listing the two homemade tortillas, everyone would assume those tortillas will be soft. If you are gonna deep fry a taco, you say so on the menu, right?  I would never, ever ever ever, get a deep fried taco. . . but that's what I got at tacubaya yesterday.I will never eat there again.  I consider most of the joints in the 4th St area overpriced and I am aware that I am paying more for the ambiance. . . . but tacubaya misses. It's just way too overpriced for what you get. And, um, do folks actually look around?  the place is kinda dark and gloomy. . . . and if you can't have your beer out on the patio. . . why, um, bother?Picoso is my go-to joint for Mexican in Berkeley.  Tacubaya is a puzzling thing. Maybe folks head down to the 4th Street area and then, since they are already there and they are beginning to figure out that Berkeley doesn't really have as many interesting funky neighborhoods as SF does and 4th STreet if the best you get in Berkeley, esp. if you want to avoid the homeless teens of Telegraph . . . then you settle for overpriced Mexican-evocative bites at Tacubaya?  Maybe?  Cause I don't undertstand why anyone would go here unless they already paid to park the car and they are trying to squeeze something out of their wasted afternoon?  Is this all there is?  I hope not."
117,Came here a week ago after wanting it for a while and the food was worse then I remember. The customer service is okay the woman manager was not super friendly kinda rude. I came with my family and son ordered tacos and a quesadilla and went to take our seat. I asked the manager for a highchair with my son in hand and she pointed to across the room not really sure where but we went to the general area and found our ourselves. The quesadilla was greasy it seemed that she sprayed it with old before cooking it my son only ate part of it and he usually loves them. I got my tacos were were flavorless for lengua my favorite kind. My  mothers were wrong and uncles had cilantro which we asked them to skip. The line for the bathroom was long and the manager came to tell us she has people working so we need to move no please just move this way and walked off. As soon as we were done eating and starting to get up the manager comes back over and starts moving everythibg from our table which is fine if your busy but no eye contact or asking us how our meal was just blocking us in as were leaving. For being as expensive as it was 3.50 per tacos the food or the service should be better at least from your manager.!
118,"omg! i want to like and support this place for when i am on 4th street for errands. but the female manager behind the counter is a ***ch. i asked for a fish taco and but without the fish, instead beans. and she was so rude about it and said no. she said you can order all the contents separately and make taco yourself. not even in a friendly tone. i told her i just got over food poisoning and couldn't eat fish right now. she was so rude. i plan to contact the owner. i have never encountered someone so rude where they are serving the public. this happened once before when i had my 1 year old. i asked for a plate of whole pinto beans and she said the only way to get that was to order some $14 soup and take the beans out!!!I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND CONTINUE TO WARN OTHERS. SHAME ON THEM FOR SUCH BAD SERVICE.quality of food is fine."
119,"bad service, cold, chewy steak and fish taco , overprice and unfriendly staff , dontdo phone order, your food will be ready for yu but the staff will refuse give to youand ask you still wait in line with those who have not yet place their order don't go, it is huge disappointment"
120,"Tacubaya is way overpriced and generally lacking service or hospitality. This has been the 3rd time I said ""never again"", always up for another chance at some redeeming quality. I'll leave it for the yuppies that want to think they're eating Mexican food. Adios Tacubaya!"
121,"hmm... maybe i'm spoiled with the cheap, good mexican places in downtown oakland, but this place didn't do it for me. yes, it's cheap for 4th street, but the food wasn't up to par. service was sub par and the other customers at this place were pretty unfriendly as well. their al pastor was actually quite bland and the other dishes my sibs got weren't all that great either (a mushroom quesadilla and a soup w/ chicken). the salsa for the chips weren't anything special. i only ate half my sandwich (i was hungry too!) and took the rest home, but i'm not really looking forward to finishing the other half."
122,"Good (okay), but I wouldn't be running back. No burritos?? Extra for rice and beans with a plate of small, albeit tasty enchiladas?? .....food was good enough, but went more out of convenience and hunger than as a destination...."
123,"In short - mediocre, too much money for their offering and very slow service.I had to wait in a line for 10 minutes - there were 5 people ahead of me! Everyone behind the counter was waiting for something to happen. The order taker was slow as heck.Neighborhood taco places do a better job with al pastor taco. This is the bland gringo taco place.I saw the cookbook and I'm not buying it."
124,"My friend and I were excited to check-out this place because we had heard good things. Lovely patio outside, busy atmosphere--- screech! (that's the sound of the breaks)- rude, inflexible service. When asked if we could get the chicken quesadilla without the chicken, my friend and I were met with a curt, ""no."" Okay, how about the enchiladas? Could you make them with cheese? ""No."" Okay, okay- well maybe using the other hand to grab the cheese is too much to ask, I get it. How about some chips and guac and two fish tacos... Okay, that's better. Guac was fresh, but only about 1/2 cup with a pile of chips for 6.95. Fish tacos were OK. Wanted some salsa and asked one of the bussers if there was a salsa bar and was met with bottles of hot sauce. My friend asked our lovely counter-person about a salsa bar and was met with a rude, ""you have to order it"" about the salsa. Boo to Tacubaya- I would much rather hit up Cactus Taqueria on Solano- much tastier and friendlier service for sure."
125,"Using quality ingredients and restaurateur's expertise doesn't guarantee something will be great and in this case Tacubaya proves it.  While you can tell thought was used in the food prep...the food is bland and over-priced and the portions tiny. For supposedly down home food, those are three big no-nos. There are a few good items, the tamals and the torta al pastor (best thing on the menu but inconsistent), perhaps the ceviche.  The physical environment is pleasant. Other then that...nada.BTW, Donna and Thomas aren't Mexican and you can tell by the food. It lacks soul and depth...perhaps love."
126,"The menu looked a lot better than the food tasted.  I was pretty disappointed overall in the taste and quaily of the dishes that I chose today.  One happened to be a tamale.  One would think that the tamale, a virtual staple in Mexican kitchens, should be good at a place like this.  Sadly, I have had better tamales off a food truck.  The other dish that I had was some sort of vegetarian sandwich.  It was palitable, but seemed meager for the price, as it consisted of more bread than what was inside.The place was hopping at lunch time and some of the other dishes on the other patrons tables looked interesting.  I might give it another try and see if this was just a bad food choice or a bad food day."
127,"not sure I understand the hype...  I wanted very much to like Tacubaya, but was totally underwhelmed.  I got a chicken taco and a fish taco and felt ripped off.  At least now I know...."
128,"Forgot abut previous disappointing lunches and went back today, craving a spicy little bite of something.  Got a chicken taco and a fish taco to go, but sat right outside because I was suddenly hungry.  Good thing I did, too, because the lunch was inedible.  There was a pool of rancid oil in the bottom of the to go box, under the chicken taco (which was still dripping from the deep fryer).  The chicken was bland shredded white meat that tasted boiled, and the salsa was flat tasting- no spice at all.  The fish taco was smelly- and it had some orangey mayonnaise type glop on it.  I tossed the whole thing in the trash (almost $8) and went over to Bette's To Go."
129,"Completely disappointing dining experience.  I waited in line for 10 minutes to place my order and I was only behind two other people!  The person at the register kept taking phone orders while people were waiting in line--not cool.  I ordered a torta al pastor (i.e., a Mexican sandwich), and boy was it seriously lacking.  It had meat and the flimsiest slice of avocado you've ever seen.  I've easily eaten over a hundred tortas from taquerias all over the bay and this was by far the most poorly executed.  The meat was decent enough, but as with any sandwich, it's all about the fixings and it had none.  No lettuce, onions, cheese, tomatoes, sour cream--nada!  Lame, lame, lame."
130,"I love the food here!!!Too bad I got sick...twice...Crazy thing...I still find myself there once in a while because though it has been inconsistent, it's still pretty tasty most of the time and I just keep my fingers crossed about handwashing."
131,"if you like paying too much money for things and have no taste, this place is for you!settled among the 4th street shops, uber yuppie thirty-somethings with infant in hand can relax and enjoy the atmosphere at what is possibly the worst restaurant i've ever been to. yes, the inside of tacubaya is pretty and pleasing to look at, i just wish i could say the same for the food.almost $5 for an itty-bitty taco, $8 for enchiladas...are they serious? dead serious, unfortunately.the ingredients did seem to be high quality enough but somewhere between their purchasing the food and serving it, they got it all wrong.  if they want to charge so much for food it had better be a.) good tasting b.) not cold, or merely lukewarm and c.) served to me from start to finish, not ordered at a counter.not only did the food not have a pleasing or desirable quality to it, it gave my boyfriend and i the worst gas we've had in ages.gas + gas = bad smells"
132,"Really awesome Tortilla Soup but went in yesterday and gave them a $50 bill.  I realized this morning I was returned change for a $20 bill.  I phoned there to which I was told the register last night was accurate and there was nothing that could be done.  Obviously someone pocketed the $30, but management is obviously unaware there is employee theft going on.  Too bad.  Gonna miss that tortilla soup!"
133,"The food here is ""eh.""Not horrible, but not mind altering either.  I read the other reviews and some mention that the taco I ordered ""taco el pollo yucko"" was deep fried which is why the taco has its unique shape.   That  might explain why the chicken tasted really  gross. Now, I'm the kind of girl that doesn't go heading for the hills when you toss something deep fried my way, but my chicken?  My chicken???   Give my chicken a little blanket of tortilla - flour or corn - and protect it from the liquid hot, should-be-melting-but-instead-its-crunchifying grease.  totally gross. My taco was okay (I'm being really nice here. my gut says ""not okay you ass, it was  disgusting), minus the spots of grease hardened cookoobird.The gauc?  Deliculous!  The chips?  Fanfreakintastic."
134,I love this restaurant so much so that we wanted to order To Go from them.  We ordered the Frijoles con Todo to go and it was 1/3 the size the portion you get when you eat in BUT you pay the same price.  We called the restaurant to speak with someone and the woman who answered said that she just answered phones - She didn't work in the kitchen and she couldn't help us.  DON'T order out.  You'll be left starving as we are now.
135,"Ehhhh.....first off, if you aren't too fond of little rug-rats taking over the entire restaurant, then venture to the next option of fare in this hood.  Seriously, load of families here.  Also a battlefield attempting to even get a seat.  There were people staked out in all vantage points eyeballing people who were leaving, hovering over folks who were even leaving...Long line too, I hate standing waiting to order food, to then sit waiting to get my food..when I'm hungry that is.  The coffee curbed the external experience, spiced with cinnamon syrup, hot and spicy.Went on a weekend, late brunch.  Not feeling too adventurous, I got a salad.  When I asked how big is the small vs the large, the guy said that the large is very big...so he convinced me to go for the small.  I don't know if he was sizing me up when I asked that question, thinking I was getting a salad because I'm watching what I eat at a place that has much plumper options....I'm just a salad connoisseur, and enjoy getting salad.Anyway, get the large.  Lots of coarse salt and avocado, which made me happy.  My new fondness of avocado had opened my world up to new and exciting experiences...it's kinda like a really good kiss-soft, scrumptious and curious.....random analogy.  I'm a fan of the spicy carrots anywhere they're offered, this was a bonus here with the a la carte items.My companero got a couple of things, one of which was a dare on his behalf.  ""Should I get the tongue taco, should I get the tongue taco?""  Sure, why not.  Don't get the tongue if your ready to eat tongue.  I think he was traumatized by it, and hope it didn't ruin ""taco"" taco for him..We didn't get chips and gauc and should have.  We both left unsatisfied and when we got to College Ave, he got a burrito.  That was yum."
136,"I finally went to Tacubaya, extremely excited after hearing great things about it from friends and reading the reviews on yelp.  The experience was definitely a little disappointing.  First of all, the line at the counter wasn't long, there were only like two people in front of us, but it took so long for us to get our food (25+ minutes).  Second off, the prices are a little high, and I don't usually mind paying extra for good or ""gourmet"" style food, but $2.50 for chips and salsa which normally come free with the meal felt like a bit of a rip.  Finally as for the food,Chips and Salsa: The chips tasted a little stale.  The red salsa was watery and the tomato chunks in it were mushy.  Definitely seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile.  The green salsa was good, but nothing special.Sope con chorizo: The bottom consists of a fried potato, which was pretty good, but it must have been overfried because it was kind of tough and extremely hard to cut.  The toppings were so salty that I couldn't really taste any of the flavors.  Each bite was like a bite of mushy salt.Pork Tamale: The pork was tender and perfectly cooked and the corn was pretty delicious.  But again, the sauce on top was kind of salty, masking some of the true flavors of the tamale.Beef enchilada: By far, the best thing we ordered.  The beef was tender and the sauce was delicious and not overwhelming.So overall, the food was only okay, the prices high, and the wait time long.  For better Mexican food, I highly recommend Cancun (excellent salsa bar) or La Familia (excellent fish tacos) in Berkeley, just about any place in the Mission, or Taqueria El Grullense down in the Mountain View/Redwood City area, or a local taco truck.  Admittedly they're dirtier, and the atmosphere won't be as good as that one finds on 4th street, but they are authentic, cheap, and delicious."
137,"I had one desire -- Mexican hot chocolate, which i had not had since 1978. I may wait another 30 years, if i live that long, if today's hot chocolate is any indicator of what is to come. It was not hot, nor even warm, just tepid and lacking in chocolate. I don't even like Mexican chocolate, so maybe it was a blessing they did not add very much to my bowl of room-temperature milk. Other people were eating food that looked good, and the bathroom was clean -- but the ""hot"" chocolate? I don't think so."
138,"The food here is delicious. But it is overpriced. Also, I have eaten here numerous times and every time the person ringing myself or my friends up has been stand-offish and unfriendly. I won't eat here any more. If the price were better I might put up with the snobbishness, but it just isn't worth it."
139,"Well, after listening to may Foodies extolling the virtues of anything Dona Tomas, my fiance and I decided to try the more casual version of Tacubaya.  We first noticed that the prices were pretty high, which we don't mind paying for good food.  Then we got the food.  Tiny little portions of barely cooked food.  our lunch came to over $35 and we were given hardly any food.  That alone would have been fine if the food we were given was really great.  Not the case.  The food was fine, but we could have gone to any hole-in the-wall taqueria and gotten better for a fraction of the price.  I am truly amazed that people have such nice things to say about such a lack luster place.  Needless to say, we did not continue our culinary adventure to Dona Tomas.  If Tacubaya is the offerings of their more casual cafe, I am certainly not wasting my time with Dona Tomas.  If you are hungry on 4th Street, I would suggest going anywhere else.  I thought the bagel I got from across the street at Manhattan Bagel tasted better."
140,"Ok...I love food and I used to love Tacubaya....I enjoy their yummy chile rellenos, salad and a few other things.  Here is the problem.  It's outrageously expensive for what you get.  They used to serve an acceptable portion of food to their customers.  For the last 6 months, it's been ridiculous.  No one there cares if you eat there or not for one thing.  The portions are ridiculous.  I know it's not fine dining, but one should respect the art of food and feel pride in feeding others right?  My husband and I work hard for our meager incomes and then I go to Tacubaya to get us dinner and they serve me 2 oz. of something they advertised as chicken quesadilla.  Honestly, it was two tiny tiny tortillas with very small piece of chicken, a pinch of cheese and a sprinkle of corn? or something on top.  This was $7????  I went back up to the register and asked the woman if this was right.  She assured me it was and I told her that this was the most ridiculous thing I had ever been served.  Ok, if I was at Boulevard and someone served me something exotic with some sauce that they slaved over all day and charged me some insane amount of money, that I would chalk up to a fine artistic dining experience and I would have knowingly assumed that I would have that experience.  I think of Tacubaya as good food for the people, but alas, no more.  They don't care.  They have turned into the typical jaded bay area restaurant.  What happened to pride in the food you serve?  To FEEDING people?  To creating joy in every bite.  I am sad.  I am defeated by eating in the bay area.  I love food, cooking, thinking about food and cooking.  Yet....I search...for...well Meal Ticket is the only saving grace at the moment.  Check it out...but only go to Tacubaya if your not hungry and you feel like having people look down their nose at you and a dirty restaurant.  Oh, I forgot some angry bay area know it all yelled at me there once as well.  Good luck!"
141,"Just went here for the first time.  Ordered a Chile Relleno to go and a coke.  It came to $11, and I figured that it was 4th street, so I didn't mind that it was a little expensive.  I get back to work to find that it's all a la carte!  My sad little relleno sat in its box all alone, and my little Mexican coke cost me $3.50!!!  Seriously guys?  It wasn't even that tasty! You can't afford $.25 worth of beans and rice so I could at least feel full?  You already made a 500% profit off of the bitty chile and some batter.  LAME!  Never going again.  I'm going to make sure everyone I know hears about your ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS PRICES!!!!"
142,I expected way more from this overpriced mexican place. The food was expensive and bland. The mexican hot chocolate was awful (i can make way better at home or even buy a better mix!) and tasteless. You'd think that a place surrounded by such great restaraunts would create some sort of incentive for people to come back. I have better luck at cactus for half the price.
143,"Just too overpriced for what it is.  I don't care how many avocados are involved or if they come from a sacred garden in the Galapagos, Guacamole should never been 6$ for a small mound easily gobbled up by no more than nine tortilla chips.  The Tamales?  Weak.  At least the beer was cold, the counter girl was pretty hot and the people watching was good.  Other than that, I'd rather show up through the back door and through down on family meal and dominoes. . . meet me at the taco truck. . . paz"
144,"Went to Tacubaya last night, and since it was cool the tortilla soup sounded good--but it was dishwater, the stock--such a critical element--tasted like it was made with freezer-burned chicken lips that had been boiled ten times already. Not doing that again. Sorry Tacubaya I used to like you!"
145,"Well, let's see if I can explain this little hidden gem in a few words.....yuppie, yucky, yummynot. This place puts a very bad name on mexican food. Terrible al pastor, trust me, do not order. The salt content alone will have you nearly passed out at your table. I've eaten here several times, always wanting to get a better meal, but never have. For some reason, the quality has just went down. A crispy chicken taco ($3.25)  has more shredded cheese than chicken...and that's all. No love...where's the real latinos!! Go travel through mexico, than come eat here......disgusting. Being that it's a direct connection to their other restaurant, Dona Tomas, you would expect some of the same spices, recipes, slow preparations....NO! Sorry, missed the connection. But....being that it is the yuppie area of 4th street, and most people are there to feel the money, and not eat the food, it gets two stars. Plus, they have blue bottle coffee. By the way, the taco truck on ashby ave blows this place out the water. Someone slap the dirty little man that thought this place is authentic....chevy's has better salsa, chips and service. Oh yes, the service.......what? who? Que? No mas comida....porfavor...no mas de tacabaya!!"
146,"over-priced.  portions are too small.  fairly tasty, but really, go to picante on  6th if you're over this way and have a hankering for ""fresh mex"".  i mean, i spent over 10 bucks on 1 fish taco, a small salad, and a mexican soda.  while i like eating outdoors, and there aren't too many walking-distance options from my office, it just doesn't seem worth it."
147,"For a place that claims to be ""committed to serving authentic Mexican cuisine,"" they've done a pretty bad job.  The menudo was totally inauthentic, unlike any other menudo I've had before, and not terribly tasty.  The tacos de asada were ok but definitely not worth the price tag.  Worst of all, I paid 3 dollars for horchata that was so bad I drank less than half the glass - it also was totally inauthentic and majorly overloaded with cinnamon.  To top it all off, when we asked for some extra tortillas to go with the menudo, the guy told us it would be a dollar and we would have to get back in line (which was huge).  Definitely not coming back here."
148,"The decor is nice and the food is presented artistically -- but the portions are small for the prices and the ceviche is -- well let's put it this way, my tongue is burning four hours later and the portion was miniscule, swimming in watery sauce with chips that would not absorb anything. I would rather eat at Taco Bell."
