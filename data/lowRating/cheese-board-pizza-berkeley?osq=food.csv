There is thick layer of grease on top and bottom of the slice. I wiped off as much as I could until I ran out of napkins. If that's what 4000+ reviews on Yelp enjoy, I won't stand in your way- Enjoy. I, for one, and my BF who agreed, will not be joining you again."
1,Of course it's a classic but lately egh! How many ingredients can you cram on one pizza. Stranger combinations doesn't mean better tasting. And they hand you the towel when you ask for a clean table so you can wipe it yourself. I know it's a collective but last time I checked I wasn't getting a cut of the profits. WipeYour own damn table.
2,"Yesterday was my first time trying Cheese Board Pizza because I saw all the wonderful reviews. I have to say that the pizza was delicious and loved the crunch of the bread. I ordered a whole pizza so that I could have leftovers for dinner. My whole perspective changed once I took a bite of my pizza (did not microwave) and found a long piece of hair stuck in the cheese. I was quite disappointed and disgusted at the same time. Sadly, I will not be coming back."
3,"Overpromised, underdelivered. Disappointing. Expensive pizza with a long line of cult bigots. Tastes just like any other pizza on a regular day, on a bad day it has weird toppings that just scream ""pretentious"". Usually closed during off-work hours."
4,"The pizza was advertised as having tomato sauce. It had none. I understand this place is generally sauceless, but you can't say the pizza of the day will have ""tomato sauce"" and then not put any in the pizza. I don't think this place serves ""pizza"", but rather, a ""cheese bread"", as most people know the definition of pizza to have tomato sauce.They have their own ""omitting sauce"" pizza style and that's totally cool, but please don't advertise the pizza as having tomato sauce and put none. That is uncool.The sauceless pizza we had was no doubt, still pretty good. This rating is for the lieee. I come to a pizzeria craving that tang and tart of the tomato sauce. Also, no ranch? Your ""pizza"" is a cheesy garlic bread/flatbread. Some tasty buttermilk ranch is necessary in that case! What's up with thattt."
5,"I had very high expectations for this place since it was recently voted as America's finest pizza. Outdoing Chicago and New York (surprisingly). Perhaps I came at the wrong day and time but the pizza was very basic to say the least. The only that that made it edible was the fact that I accidentally poured the entire chili flakes onto the pizza (someone had apparently not screwed on the cap tightly and it came off as I was using it) and dipped it in the pesto salsa. The pizza toppings that day were: cremini, oysters, mushroom, mozzarella, baby dino kale, caramelized onions, parsley, oregano, garlic olive oil, and cave aged gruyere. I saw and tasted one oyster in the entire pizza (bought an entire box). It was very disappointing. In addition, the pizza was hard and very uncomfortable to chew. The pizza seemed to be old (from earlier that morning) since I came during the second opening (4:30-close) and that they had just reheated it in the oven. The crust was so hard that I had to throw all of it away and I usually love the crust. Cheeseboard reminds me a lot of Sliver which I find is a lot better than Cheeseboard. They have lunch specials, a bar, and a lot more seating inside and outside. Cheeseboard is so overrated. Plus, they're closed on Mondays in addition to many other restaurants in the Bay Area and that completely bugs since people still ho out to eat on Mondays. However, the pesto salsa is beyond AMAZING and I'll probably come back just to buy some for home."
6,Over rated pizza. There are plenty of places in Berkeley where people can eat a better pizza.Cheeseboard Pizza didn't impress me at all with the quality but what really bothered me has been the lack of attention to the customer. I would say definitely rude. I would have given 2 stars for the pizza and zero for the experience at the table. So I came up with an average of one. Won't be back anymore and my friends too.....
7,"After living in Berkeley for so long, I was excited to finally try the Cheeseboard that everyone talks so much about. Maybe my expectations were too high coming in, but I thought the pizza was way overrated. Today, the daily special was the asparagus, mushroom, and mozzarella pizza. When my pizza arrived, I noticed that it looked just like the pizza at Sliver would look like. After taking a couple of bites, I noticed how bland, cold, and rubbery the pizza was. Now that's significant coming from me because I'm the kind of person who is normally not into strong, salty flavors. However, Cheeseboard's green cilantro sauce was very tasty (the one thing that's better than Sliver's)  and helped balance out the bland pizza. Cheeseboard was an interesting experience. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't make me want to come back for more."
8,"For a 4.5-star Yelp reviewed restaurant, Cheese Board Pizza was disappointing to say the least.  If someone were to blindfold me and had me eat a slice for this restaurant, I would have said it was OK but it wasn't my favorite.  To learn that this is MOST reviewed establishment in Berkeley with a 4.5-star rating on Yelp is baffling to me.A slice of pizza from Cheese Board resembles closely to a cheese stick but with less cheese.  The cheese is essentially burnt on, which makes the slice crispy and hard, and the toppings are sparse and underwhelming.  I found the pizza to be really oily too.  Cheese Board is all hype and maybe a favorite with many UCB Yelpers because of its proximity to the campus.Despite the long line, it moves fast because they only serve one type of pizza each day.  In other words, you'll get your pizza handed to you before you even finish your transaction at the register.  It costs $11 for half a pizza and $22 for a full pizza.  Maybe the rave reviews are from those who think the prices aren't that high but the pizza was seriously underwhelming and I doubt I'll ever return again."
9,"Meh, maybe I'm just a snob when it comes to pizza but this is just... okay. Every time I've gone there and tried the different slices of pizza they have everything is always oily and over saturated with moisture. The topics are usually average in quantity but most of the time I've had a single piece of potato on the top of a slice and thats it. I don't know, I'd take Zachary's over this any day of the week. That's the true Pizza spot of the East Bay in my opinion."
10,"I spent $70.00 on two pizzas, 2 TINY glasses of wine and 2 salads.The live music was awesome and the place was crowded but not overwhelming. Just enough to make it seem like an excellent restaurant. I suppose it is and that's why all the people were there. The service was good. The people were nice. But that pizza... it was greasier than Domino's with a very special think crust that I wouldn't order again. It greased through the bottom of the box. The bottom of the pizza did. I gave that pizza away to a nice homeless man who was drinking left over booze from the bottles in the trash out side.  I wont be coming back. It was loud and no one cleaned up after themselves. We had to move trash off our table to sit down. All the tables were the same thing. Expensive, too greasy, and the Berkeley crowd can't figure out how to clean up. No thanks."
11,"overrated and overpriced rabbit food.  It's the food equivalent of the playa experience at burning man.  Countless sheep will recount how it changed their lives when they haven't seen, tasted, or experienced true magic.I'd recommend Rotten City but apparently a pizza is $30+ there now.  The bay area just sucks."
12,"If Cheese Board Pizza was an NBA basketball player, it would be DeAndre Jordan: all flash, totally overrated.Sure, it's got the unique business model and the chill atmosphere. But at the end of the day, if the pizza tastes average, nothing else really matters. The pizza at Cheeseboard was oily and bland. If I wanted that, I would've gone to Seniore's. I just don't see the hype."
13,I'm sorry I don't see what all the hype is about cheese board pizza!! The pizza dough texture is a combination of rubber & cardboard.They also put red onion on ever pizza they make !! I've had the salad and it was good but nothing that memorable.
14,"Four stars for greasy pizza is overrated. The Ingredients look and taste fresh, but the pizza it's just too greasy for me. I do not think is worth to come from far to try this pizza."
15,Not worth it. The pizza was overcooked and had such a hard crust. I decided to throw more than a half of the pizza. The green sauce was alright but not great. I will never go again.
16,what i ordered... pizza of the day (Saturday)I don't know what's the big fuss about this place...  line was so long just to get  a so-so slice of pizza or maybe because i was the only one who lined up for the taste of the food and not for the establishment's berkeley aura.pizza tasted ok but the crust was hard and oilyambiance... good (a very loud live band playing inside and some table and chairs outside to gobble your food if you can find an empty one)service... so-so (i guess because there's so many customer's in line to handle)cost... $ (fair)
17,"The atmosphere is great - I really love the live music and outdoor seating. But the pizza is so-so, especially when you consider how long you have to wait in line to get it."
18,"I don't get the hype. I don't like the thin crust, and I also don't like their flavor combos. I like being able to choose my toppings. This goes against what tons of other people think, but really just not a fan. Not worth lining up for."
19,"Another case of the urban myth surpassing the reality. Not worth it. Go to their bakery next door instead and grab a loaf of the curry bread, or something else interesting. But don't get sucked into the hype of this place."
20,"It finally happened:  I visited a 4.5 star average rating restaurant and didn't love it.  I see the draw of this place, but the sheer volume of grease on the pizza was just too much for me.  We used a giant stack of napkins to soak it all up and there was still oil dripping from the slices as we ate.  I felt gross sitting there looking at the greasy pizza box while we ate.  The flavor was good, but the grease was NOT my style at all."
21,"You can read all about how unique a pizzeria Cheese Board is in other reviews, but although I've visited twice, I don't plan on returning again soon. Sure it's vegetarian, but you can get a veggie pie damn near anywhere. Cheese Board is unique in that it is employee owned and operated.The first time I went there, the pizza was ok but was made with lemon zest, which overwhelmed all of the other ingredients on the pie. It was also incredibly oily.A few weeks later, I had friends visiting and I wanted to give Cheese Board a second chance because I had faith in communal wisdom. We had the Fall Delight: Butternut squash, parsnip, baby kale, mozzarella, gruyere cheese, balsamic reduction, breadcrumbs, and fresh herbs. Again, the crust was chewy, the pizza was VERY oily, and the flavors clashed. We purchased 2 whole pies, but my friends had 1 slice each before turning it away in disgust, leaving me with a pie and a half to dispose of.I will not be coming back."
22,Been going to The Cheesboard for years.  Went last week - shocked to see the price of a pizza increased 20% to $24!!  That is very very expensive for a veggie pizza.  Just be forewarned on the price increase.  I wasn't and was shocked when I saw the price.  Crazy!
23,People think McDonalds is amazing too.I can't believe that this place was voted #2 in Yelp.. it is okay..
24,"Wayyyy too cheesy. You can't taste any other ingredient. Doesn't matter that they use fresh vegetables because all you taste is the cheese. Hold off on so much cheese, Cheese Board."
25,Cheese  w/ sliced Tomoato on a usual pizza..good.. but this one was bombarded with cilantro and covered with lemon zest...I understand that this place is deigned towards vegans..But whoever designed that particular topping combo must've been trying a little too hard with contradicting flavors/tastes.... kinda like mixing perrier  sparkling water and Coca Cola...They've got better toppings to offer on other days.. but this one just blew...I should have know  why the line was shorter than usual..
26,"Sorry to have to say this; but they are going down- hill on their pizza; too much cheese and definitely swimming in oil; I always order mine""no oil please"" and it is still swimming in oil; I must be the only one in Berkeley who finds the pizza no good; I love the music, the ambience, and the staff; but they need to revamp the pizzas as I have suggested above.. I now have only salad and wine there; last time I threw the pizza out.  Sorry my friends."
27,"food excellent, almost all staff cordial, helpful... i often buy coffee, sit out ,enjoy it with a sweet something....  since store has no microwave ( you really should) i sometimes ask for a tad more coffee to get it warm in absence of the micro... almost always, i am cordially given a bit more coffee, no cost.....but there is one asian woman at register who needs attitude fix.... she is on automatic for all purchases and when asked for a tad more coffee says ""we charge for that"".... and turns away....does not make for an enjoyable few minutes with my coffee and a purchased treat.....nor does she make paying for any other purchases pleasant either....i know the store has as much business as it can handle but really, have your manager ponder this particular employees customer relation skills....she is the employee likely to say that if she gives me a tad more coffee- at no charge- she will have to do that for everyone...i have seen that stance before and it does not serve the business...."
28,"OVER RATED & NOT IMPRESSED.CHEESE BOARD PIZZA HAS ONLY ONE TYPE OF PIZZA PER DAY, IT CHANGES EVERYDAY, AND ITS ALWAYS MEATLESS! MEATLESS?! I AIN'T NO VEGETARIAN!!!Keeping this to the point, since I know many people don't have the patience to read PhD dissertation writing styled reviews either. PROS:-- Unique combination of of vegetables and tubers that go into this pizza (today it was: potatoes, lemon zest, beets, cheese, parsley, tofu, black pepper, green onions and zucchini.) -- Vegan/Vegetarian friendly-- Live band was entertaining the crowd while patrons enjoyed their pizza.CONS:-- PARKING FXXKN SUCKS!!! Unless you are feeling lucky?-- Ridiculously long lines (which wasn't too bad)-- Only one type of pizza per day, which are geared for vegans/vegetarians.-- Some parts of the pizza were cold.-- Too greasy and extremely salty. -- Too many hipsters and band wagoners. SERVICE:Quick, but Mediocre. Meh.OVERALL EXPERIENCE:I stopped by for pizza since I was starving and ate a whole pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza was not filling, and I ended up going to one of many commercial pizza shops in the area to fulfill my pizza cravings. While the ingredients in the pizza were definitely a unique combination, Cheese Board Pizza lacked flavor. The only thing I was able to taste was the extremely salty Mozzarella cheese, some hints of lemon zest and crushed black pepper, BUT THAT'S IT. As hyped up as this place may be, I wasn't very excited about it when I took my first bite of heart attack greasiness. This was my first time eating at Cheese Board Pizza, but will be avoiding it from now on. Perhaps I'll return to update my review in 5 years?"
29,"It was my first time here. I came right when they opened and there was a long line already. That day they were serving garlic corn pizza. To be honest, I was not impressed at all.  The crust was overcooked and burned. There wasn't enough garlic flavor and not enough corn. The dough was not flavorful either.  Service was great though. They have a live band and outdoor seating.  Overall, Arzimendi in Oakland is a lot better. I don't think I am coming back."
30,"As a New York lady, I have to say I'm gravely disappointed by cheese board. IMHO, this just is *not* pizza. Try Artichoke's on Durant for some real pizza."
31,Pizza was meh. Not worth the hype or the long line. I feel like everyone is raving about the green sauce which is really good but pretty much just Aji Verde.
32,"No doubt, Cheese Board Pizza is an institution in Berkeley on a Saturday at lunch.  But the pizza?  I get the sense that it is made the day before.  It feels a bit stale to me on the occasions that I've gone.  The ambiance is lovely where they have some of great live music.  But the actual pizza?  Well, that's what they are there for, and it's sort of stale."
33,"I don't get the hype on this place. I work around the corner and see a line out the door and down the block every night, but I've never been much impressed. Their pizza is more like greasy cheese toast pie, and when you put the pesto sauce on it, all their pizzas end up tasting the same.There must be something in it that really gets other people's bones a-jonesin' but it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's the east coaster in me, or maybe I lack the sufficient tastebuds to taste the refined and nuanced flavors of Cheeseboard pizza, but I'd say it doesn't live up to the fame.Their scones and cheese shop next door is AMAZING though, definitely would check that out!"
34,"After seeing Cheese Board pizza rate so high with the Yelp review (2nd in the nation!) I simply had to see for myself.  Yes, there was a long line of followers waiting for the doors to open.  Yes, the folks in the line were very excited about the pizza being offered today.  Yes, we were hungry!  The pizza was mediocre, and now 3 hours later I have heartburn.  I'll go with a Costco pizza any day over a Cheese Board, and at half the price (Costco $10, Cheese Board $20), but what the hey, it wasn't bad pizza and we did have enough left over for my daughter and grandson to enjoy."
35,"I gave 2 stars for effort, but we did not like the 'pizza.' We came from out of town and seen the madness over this place so we had to check it. It's not pizza, it's flat pita bread with a ton of cheese and pesto!! That's all you taste is the heavy toppings. We were disappointed even more so when the digesting process began! No thank you!"
36,"To expensive, not proven that it is organic, to long lines and just a few tables you can sit on. The Pizza was ok but I would not say it is the best I have ever eaten."
37,"Cheese Board pizza is too rich for my tastes in more ways than one. Gives me indigestion of the stomach as well as the wallet. Sorry, I am not a fan."
38,"When my sister and I were in NYC earlier this summer, we went to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn which was one of the highest ranked pizza places on Yelp. We weren't sure if the pizza would live up to the hype, but it really did. It was fantastic! All of the elements on the pizza were in perfect harmony. Some times, things really are as good as you imagine them to be. Unfortunately, Cheese Board pizza is not one of those things.Cheese Board is definitely one of the highest ranked pizza places around these parts. However, in my opinion, it does not live up to the hype. They do things differently, but being unique isn't the same thing as being great (in spite of what a lot of people in Berkeley seem to think; I'm looking at you, guy-I-saw-on-Shattuck-walking-around-with-no-shirt-on-with-a-septum-piercing-connected-to-his-two-nipple-piercings-by-gold-chains-to-form-a-weird-triangle).The vegetables on the pizzas are certainly great, and the cheese tastes amazing. If they stopped there, the pizza would be light and flavorful. However, they always proceed to drench it in garlic olive oil. This makes it heavy and oily; Too much so for my taste. It just detracts from what would have been a very good pizza.The restaurant definitely has a cool atmosphere. However, the pizza is too oily, so I have to say that this place is overrated."
39,Worse pizza I ever had in my life really disappointed I was looking forward to try it I'll never repeat it it was like deep fired pizza I was squeezing  it before eating to take the oil out it turn my stomach inside out worse pizza ever I do not know how the people stay in line for hours to eat this kind of pizza buy frozen one it taste much better I wish I can put minus 5 stars
40,"I'm a pizza snob, and this place is so over-ate-it. I was excited to try this joint because of all the raving reviews so I mindlessly ordered the giant box for $21. I didn't dislike the Cilantro/Spinach/Mushroomy pizza but I'm just not a fan of all-vegetarian pizzas. Taking meat away from my pizza is like taking away a color from a rainbow. No bueno!Bottom line, I never had a pizza I didn't enjoy. But, I will never come back again. The loud music was...so loud I had to strain to hear my cashier. Instead of those cellos, more tables and chairs would help the restaurant's efficiency. Finally, this location attracts a lot of the city's finest weirdos so that's my 2 cents whether you want it or not. I wish I had a better experience :( I really wanted to like this place."
41,"So disappointed! I've been wanting to try this place for a while due to the great reviews, but when I finally tried it last week, it was very underwhelming. The flavor of the day was pear, walnut, and blue cheese. The flavors didn't really come together, and it more or less tasted like bland cheese pizza. I was not a fan of the cilantro dressing for the salad either. Just tastes like...oil. Maybe I just came on a day with an iffy flavor (also don't love the fact that you're stuck with the flavor of the day), but the most important part of a pizza is the crust, and I didn't think the crust at Cheese Board was anything special either.Glad I tried it, but will have to chalk this one up to hype."
42,Great food.  Horrible parking and service not so good.  Food was not worth the hassle.  Won't come here again.
43,"I've tried twice now, because of the reputationbut my conclusion is clearit is far tooooo greasyeach pizza is literally dripping with oilI've experienced that before only with french fries in a Five GuysI can't go back to that place"
44,"Go once for the atmosphere, experience it, forget about it.They claim to have a different pizza everyday, but they really only have one kind: girl oil pizza!Unless you are a garlic lover, stay away."
45,"being from NY I know what pizza should be. their pizza while better than the chains. it only good, no way no how they are 5 stars that is from people that don't know pizza"
46,"If you are from NY this pizza by the slice sucks not worth the line stay away , place is nice with live music"
47,"This place offers ONE type of pizza per day, and you do not have a choice in toppings.  The crust is not crispy, nor chewy, and if you order a whole pizza, it may not even be hot.  I do not understand the hype for this place - people wait in a long-ass line, for mediocre-at-best pizza, and don't even get a seat in a restaurant - I saw 3 groups of people eating on the center median lawn divider of the street, next to a sign saying do not block median.  We ended up eating the lukewarm pizza in our car, which was parked a few feet away from the ""restaurant"".  For fantastic pizza, I could understand - but, this place has far from fantastic pizza.  I could overlook not being able to choose toppings if the crust was delicious - crispy with a chewy center and flavorful, but IT WAS NOT any of those things.  I would not go back."
48,"Over-rated and over-oiled.They never use marinara and you have to sit on the filthy ground while you eat because they don't offer enough tables to their customers. Also, the pizza is often cold. Honestly, these are requirements #1, #2, and #3 for a pizza joint.The two things which work to their advantage is that they always have long lines and they choose your food for you. Berkeley denizens love these things because they make the experience more prestigious.Avoid the potato pizza, which they seem to offer every time I go there."
49,"so take this review with a grain of salt.  I think if you want to walk in and get a pie or a slice- you will have no complaints.  The long lines move fast and their pizzas are good.  I ordered 8 plain pies and 3 specials in advance.  Called again to confirm the order.  When I arrive - they have done nothing and aren't even up front with me about having completely botched things.  When they  finally accept their mistake they were very apologetic - gave me extra pies etc.  However, I had to wait an extra hour - when I expected to waltz in and be able to pick them up. Its not like they comp'd me 3 pies- they gave me 3 extra pies on top of what I ordered.  I don't need 3 extra pies of pizza!    Also - to add to the negative experience- they didn't even make my order correctly.  They were supposed to be 1/2 baked - and they weren't.  I will not use them again for a party- but if I was in the neighborhood- I would go in with just my family.."
50,"Good GOD - the lines here are WAAAAAAAAY to long!!!! I mean, it's pizza. Yes, it's good... but really? Is it wait-in-line-for-45-mintues good? Me thinks not. At least they provide entertainment (Jazz trio, ok!) for you to enjoy while you wait in line... but still."
51,"Not sure what the big deal is about this place.  The pizza sounded good on the menu board - summer squash with aged Asiago and basil pesto but just a pile of blend, greasy, cheesy bread.  I waited in a huge line for a pizza I couldn't wait to throw away.  The ambience and service were great.  Would never recommend the pizza based on what I tasted today."
52,I like the relaxed atmosphere and live music was great. They have only one type of pizza per day but boy was is greasy when I was there. I ended up not eating most of it as it was dripping with oil and I felt not great for the rest of the day.
53,"Food is worth the wait but the experience and staff is not.After following the lemmings to this pizza joint I waited a good 20 minutes in line to order my food. New to The Cheese Board I found their one type of pizza menu intriguing, ordered two slices and a beer and made my way to a table with a vacant seat. I set my food down and start to sit when a girl comes over and points to a bag sitting across the table from my food. Doesn't speak just points awkwardly as if I should know that's her seat. Her's, who is still in line. Waiting to order. While I paid my money and have my food.I look at her, pick up my food and walk away shaking my head. Outside I find another squatter sitting at a table holding it for her party while they wait to order food. I ask if I can eat there, she says yes. But it's sans chair so I ask the neighboring table if I can use one of their empty chairs. The girl says ""No, we have friends coming"". ""Can I use sit until they arrive?"" ""No, they're almost here"".I stand dumbfounded, shake my head and start to eat. Standing up. Feeling like Forest Gump but older and with more confidence I go to a guy working behind the counter and ask if they have a sitting policy because I've ordered my food but can't find a seat while other customers who have yet to pay are saving seats.He brushes me off with a self righteous grunt and I return to eating like a giraffe seriously questioning the Berkley I'm in right now. Maybe I should talk to people in terms they understand ""Hey Berkley, I feel displaced like a Syrian refugee and just want to eat my food sitting down. Can you help a brother out?""I see a lone chair in in the corner and no one puts baby in the corner...and yet Cheese Board Pizza did. Where is Patrick Swayze (...to soon?)Listen up Cheese Board Pizza, your food is good so why not create some policies that make your patron's feel welcomed and wanted. Take a page from Maple & Motor in Dallas. They too are very popular and posts signs instructing their patron's that seats and tables are for patron's who have ordered their food, and not people waiting to order."
54,"I had been reading about their soft serve ice cream for weeks, and was looking forward to trying it. So, today I had one of their half chocolate / half vanilla swirl cones. It reminded me of the old joke ""the food was terrible, and the portions were so small""! Actually, the soft serve was not exactly terrible, but it was too sweet, had no discernible vanilla or chocolate flavor whatsoever, and lacked the lightness and freshness of the best soft serve. The ""richness"" that other reviewers have described felt to me more like goopiness. To add insult to injury, the soft serve barely extended an inch above the rim of the tiny cone. Maybe making soft serve from buffalo milk is not such a good idea after all."
55,"It was a real mixed bag,  mostly positive so I should get down to the reason for two stars. I went to the counter for a second glass of wine, tendered $10 for  a  $5 glass of wine and was given $4 in change. I questioned that and was told it was $5 plus tax. The last I knew, the  tax in CA is not 20%. With very ill grace I was given my proper change. Now, 50 some cents is not a big deal but gosh  darned it, you tender the right change. I have no idea if it was just this cashier or if it is a policy but it is fraudulent.OK, give me a minute or two to get my knots untangled. It was a day off for me and I went  looking for some music we could listen to. I found out that Quinn DeVeaux & The Blue Beat Review would be playing at Cheese board Pizza and they sounded good. Frankly we were not at all familiar with the format here but took it. It is a fixed price menu.  Whatever the pizza of the day  is, that is what you get. You had  better like it because there are no alternatives. It was actually good. Very good. There was a good  selection of beers at $3 and wine at $5 a glass. The wine I  had was the grenache  and was very good. I suppose people come here for the food, not the music. The music was very good. Excellent. I felt sorry for them playing for a bunch of  people not playing any attention. That is excepting one boy, two years old at most, boogieing to beat the band.. It was a treat. The singer got a hold of that,  gri nned and the music ramped up. It would have been a good YouTube video.  In the end,, a decent pizza place (but watch for your change) but not what we went for, to listen to music."
56,I don't get it!  The breads from the cheese board are wonderful but the pizza crust on the popular pizza is tough!  And so overpriced!
57,"A place that is famous to the Gourmet Ghetto, but just because you are famous, doesn't mean you are GOOD. Also they expanded, and expansion comes at a cost. That cost here, is an even bigger drop in quality.I've been going here on and off for years. Mostly it's because people I know want to try it out, not because I recommend it (I never do). When it was a small hole in the wall located next to the flowershop adjacent to the North Shattuck Bank of America, it was decent, for what it is. Now that they have expanded, I find that they have to meet a huge surge in demand every week, and as a result, there is a pretty big variance in the quality of the ""pizza"". And I use quotes because technically......they aren't serving PIZZA. They make and serve CHEESE-BREAD. Stay with me, as I will explain later.So this place expanded, and now has a huge space. But in doing so, they left out a BIG part of the equation having to do with great pizza: they opted to NOT install true pizza ovens, and instead use the same type of bakery ovens used next store at Cheeseboard. The result? Well think about it. These ovens have WIRE RACKS, and as such, the pizzas will never get cooked on the bottom. Sure, they get slightly cooked, but will not get the way a crust should be, as it is not making contact with a flat griddle, only having....the wire rack.What they then do to compensate, is they run each pie, after it comes out of the bread oven, on to a flattop griddle, to then finish cooking it. REALLY? Might it just have been easier (and more proper) to install true pizza ovens in the first place? As a result of this two-step process, I either get ""pizza"" with crust that is not fully cooked on the bottom (awesome), or I get ""pizza"" that is burnt. And this is due not only to the wrong way they go about cooking their pies, but also due to the demand. Since they are trying to feed SO MANY people, they have to crank out these ""pizzas"" as fast as possible, and when you do this, quality always suffers.Now to the definition of PIZZA. Merriam-Webster says the following: a dish made typically of flattened bread dough spread with a savory mixture usually including tomatoes and cheese and often other toppings and baked --called also pizza pieNow sure, it doesn't say here that it HAS to have tomato sauce, but I believe that's because it's a given. Sure, you say there is such a thing as a Venetian white pizza, I get it. But that came about later in the game. Pizza in my world (a world where I grew up surrounded by ITALIAN AMERICANS in the NJ-PHILLY-NY area) always had tomato sauce on it. And this place opts to not use tomato sauce, presumably to keep their profits HIGH. So the result is you get a mixture of cheeses, and some other random ingredients, but never tomato sauce. Which is why I call this cheese bread, and nothing more.Not only that, but it's always vegetarian. You see, since they only make one kind of pie each day, they obviously want to cater to the largest demographic. So by having it be vegetarian, all the Berkeley hippies and picky college kids can eat it. But how about having some salumi on it every so often? They could do something killer with all the locally made charcuterie (salami for the lay person), but instead offer the same 7-10 types of pie over...and over....and over again. This makes for the expected, not the transcendent.And let's face it - this place is making money hand over fist. The product they offer (cheesebread) is not expensive to make, especially when they buy all their cheese in bulk (their cheese shop is right next door), and when they don't buy tomato sauce. So it's just flour for the crust, and cheese, with a few minor additions. They sell pies for $20 (or more now, since now they add tax, whereas before it was included), and will sell hundreds of pies daily. What a racket.It may be historical to this area of North Berkeley, but I'm a REAL PIZZA man, and this place serves CALIFORNIA CHEESEBREAD, and not true pizza. Go here if you must, but just know that in the last few years, many great real pizzerias have sprouted up all over the place. I would patron those other establishments, since they are staying true to tradition. This place? They are navigating according to their own map, and as a result, they serve a product of questionable quality, with no integrity. Is there a line down the street most days of people waiting to eat their pies? Well sure. But all that proves yet again, is that the masses are ignorant. And with most people never having true, East Coast style pizza, I guess that's why they can get away with it.So if you go there, enjoy their faux-pizza, because we don't want you at the pizzeria anyway."
58,"I want to drink the Kool-aid and just adore the Cheese Board's iconic pizza.  It's not the weird flavors, in fact I think the experience of standing in line and getting just one kind of pizza and then eating it out on the grassy median in the middle of traffic on Shattuck is rather interesting and cool, however, the pizza is:GreasyRubberyToughNastyThere.  I said it.  Which is strange, because the Cheese Board makes some of the best pastries ever (especially the scones!  deep yum!)So, just had to toss my review into the ocean of fawning that are the thousands of reviews for this Berkeley institution.  Go there for the experience, not the pizza!"
59,"When I went, the crust was bland, white, flabby, and underdone. I don't want my pizza crust to share the same physical characteristics as Bill O'Reilly, so this didn't appeal to me.The toppings were unique but on the oily side, and I didn't love the corn/cilantro whatever combination they had going on that day. The pizza also came out room temperature, which detracted from the tastiness. All in all, I'd rate the toppings a 3 and the crust a 2. So 2.5 stars overall."
60,"It's all hype. There is no sauce so it's more like bread with cheese than pizza.. and its sooooooooooo GREASY!!! It's like they inject the crust with oil and then pour some on top of the cheese. The crust is heavy and sorta thick and definitely not crunchy (it absorbs the oil). The flavor is good, but would be 10x better with sauce."
61,"I finally bought a  pie last night, I've been hearing about this place for 8 months. As someone who makes their own pizza, I expected that Cheeseboard would at least produce something better than I can make at home. I wasn't expecting the pizza to be anything comparing to NYC, I've never found pizza anywhere in the country that can compare to the the NE, but I was expecting it to be better than what I make at home. The crust was terrible, it was hard and unevenly cooked. The toppings for the night could have been a hit if it weren't for the very metallic aftertaste...I have no idea what it could have been from, I regularly eat pine nuts, spinach, and onions and have never encountered such an off taste on my palate. As others have mentioned, it was very oily. Berkeley is really striking out for me in the food dept., high end and low end."
62,I have always loved this place but after my wife and I fell ill with food poisoning not so sure about this place. My suspicion is the green sauce left on the counter.
63,"This is an example of how the Berkeley herd mentality can benefit a business to an absurd, almost laughable extent. The pizza is terrible by any standard - greasy, weird ingredients, I can understand that as a single-option-per-day operation you have to get creative, but the three times I've eaten here it's been marginal to outright inedible.Cut through the herds of recent vegetarians, Berkeley students (really one and the same, if we're honest,) people blindsided by everyone else's undeserving enthusiasm, and you have a restaurant that deserves little to none of the praise heaped upon it."
64,"The pizza was as stiff a a board, and hard to eat, as if it was day-old: yelp.com/biz_photos/chee…"
65,"Closed on Sunday AND Monday.  Lame.  I have come to rely on competitors that are open 7 days a week and better hours with equally delicious pizza.  Love your pizza, but only when my work schedule allows me to."
66,Too much oil. Greasy with generally soggy crust. Only fresh vegetables saves. The pizza
67,"I really don't get it.  If you like things like raw onions on your pizza maybe this is the place for you.  I lived in this neighborhood for many years and am a big fan of the Cheese Board and their bakery   But I always walk by the lines   and think ""there are SO many better places in the East Bay to get pizza.""  Its not particularly tasty.  Its not particularly healthful (I mean, its pizza).  Why?  Its not worth it even when there is no line. Don't go just because everyone says ""it's great!"".  This is not for everyone and you have to put up with a lot of annoying weekenders while you wait for your slice."
68,"Pizza is good but not great. Like many others I found the staff to be arrogant and indifferent to customer needs. I asked for their famous green sauce and was told,""we only have what's out on the tables."" This was two hours before they close. Bottom line is that there are better places to eat for that price... Especially considering that this is the Bay Area. Also, there are homeless people everywhere outside expecting to get a slice of your pizza or some change. The restaurant not only embraces this crowd, they treat them better than paying customers since they pick up after patrons with the expectation of being tipped as if they are some kind of unofficial employees. This allows the actual employees to spend more time chatting with each other while ignoring customers. Overall, this place is just annoying."
69,I had high expectations for this place but it feel so short. I would have have to agree with some reviewers that it's way too oily and the dough is just too chewy. It felt more like a ciabatta bread then a dough. I spent many napkins just trying to soak up the oil on my Pizza. I like my thin crust like the rustic NY pizza.The only Pro to this place is the atmosphere and the fresh ingredients.
70,"I know Cheese Board is an institution in Berkeley, but I really just don't get it. There's no sauce!! Don't call it pizza if it's not pizza! It was just super greasy and too oily for my taste. Great pizza, like at Pizziaolo for instance, doesn't need to be greasy! Luckily my friend and I came when there was no line, but I  probably would have been more offended by the food if I additionally had to wait in a long line. There was enough seating so we didn't risk our lives by sitting in the median of the road. Overall, I'm glad I tried this place because now I know what it's all about, but it was just NOT GOOD."
71,"This place uses quality ingredients, but unfortunately they seem to use a very limited variety of them. Every pizza I have ever eaten from here which is between 8-12 had pine nuts and feta cheese. I personally love pine nuts, but they do not belong on every pizza with every topping. The feta definitely detracts from the flavor of all the other toppings"
72,"I know this place is beloved, but I don't understand why.  Only one flavor on the menu per day, it's cold, and their combos are alright, but not that special.  Not worth the long wait."
73,"Came to Cheeseboard and ordered the one pizza they were serving that night - cilantro, corn, lime, and feta cheese.  The line was long but moved really fast!  This pizza was delicious.  On with my night, go home go to sleep (mind you, I didn't have anything to drink).  12:30AM - I wake up with violent pains in my stomach and what do you know, food poisoning.  Ugh.  It was brutal. I'll save the details, we all know what its like.  I didn't feel 100% for almost a week. I love pizza and I couldn't eat pizza again for months.  Just thinking about it literally makes me shudder.Worst weekend EVER."
74,"The day my family and I went, the restrooms where nasty and dirty and no toilet paper, the pizza was not that great for the time it took them to,give it to us. The green sauce was kinda icky and sour. I will never come back again. Sorry but I will try another pizza joint out, ps: turn around and go."
75,Beyond over rated. Tombstone frozen pizza tastes better than this. Don't bother eating or waiting for this pizza. Berkeley must have other worth while food. I have nothing more to say but yelp is making me write more to make this post happen.
76,"Pizza that is okay, but highly greasy.Anyone who is actually familiar with pizza will almost immediately call this place out; the crust is shit. There's no way around this point. It's cracker and bread like with almost no chew. They actually brown the crust on the stove, so the oven must be crap. No hole structure in the crust, no actual texture... just shitty pizza crust that one might see at papa johns.The cheese forms a greasy pool of fat on top. The selection of cheese changes so I guess one day it may not be this way.Go for any cheese you may like to see melted; this is not a good pizza."
77,can someone please explain how this place has high ratings? the pizza tastes disgusting! must be the live music and open seating in the middle of the smoggy center divide outside....not for me.
78,"The food is good, but I gotta say that the customer service was rude as hell the last time I was there.I got a super important call on my cell phone when I was in line and instead of politely tolerating the annoying guy on his cellphone (me);  the guy taking my order was an ass about it and a bit self-righteous, pretending he could not hear me when I was pretty darn clear that I was ordering a slice of a pizza.  It was not a complicated order, ""one slice of pizza"".  He actually had that order like 500 times that day.... and they only have one type of pizza.  But in order to make some kind of personal point, he had to go out of his way and pretend he could not hear what I was saying because I had a cell phone in my hand.  [FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE WAS RUDE].  Perhaps the self-righteous hipster stink-eye would have been fine, but he made a whole scene!  So, food, good.  Self-righteousness and rudeness was over the top.  It kinda made me not notice the taste of the pizza.But then again, I hate the guy with the cell phone too.... (this time it was me).And as much as I hate the cell-phone guy, I gotta say, I hate the self-righteous person across the counter who pretends they can't hear in order to make a point even more.Even though I was partially in the wrong (being on a cell phone), the dude totally ruined my food experience of otherwise decent pizza.I woulda rated this experience a 1, but gotta admit, I was on my cell, so I'm giving it a 2."
79,"I don't see what the fuss is about. These flat breads (please don't call them pizza) are mediocre. I only went once so I can't comment on the different toppings they offer from day to day (other than to go say that the one option, no menu thing is a gimmick), but flatness and pizza are all about the crust for me, and this one was disappointing. Overuse of oil was one problem. Worse, however, was how underdeveloped it was, with large cavities and an insufficient rise, leading to a texture that was dense and uneven. I enjoy both thin, hard crusts and toothsome, airy crusts, but this is the worst of both worlds. The cheese they use is excellent of course, and I imagine they come up with some amazing topping combinations, but their baking needs work. As a side note, I found the same problems in their yeast risen baked goods next store,  seemingly symptomatic of rushing the product, probably with too much yeast and not enough rise time, although other factors might be in play. Overall, this is not much better than a novice could make at home."
80,"What is up with the hype with this place? When I went to Cal, i was never a fan of this pizza place. The pizza is like vegetarian style pizza with only cheese flavor. I rather eat Costco Combo pizza if you ask me."
81,"My sister was raving about this place and how it features a pizza of the day, so I was looking forward to trying it. The wait in line wasn't too bad, but seeing the amount of people there I thought it was a good sign. We ordered two pizzas and a large salad and sat at the middle divider where I guess it's a tradition to do so.I started on the salad first and I thought it was pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary. Then I ate a slice of pizza and thought it was good as well. It definitely didn't satisfy my expectations of all the hype, so I would've given it a 3 (I wasn't overwhelmed by the customer service either since our cashier was a little rude). I started eating the salad again, and to my GREAT disgust, found a yellow beetle-looking bug with black spots on it. It definitely hadn't fallen in the salad during the time I ate it because it looked like it had been dead for a while. After that I completely lost my appetite, and had to give it a poor review. I'm sure it doesn't happen often and that I just happened to get the bad salad, but it's still pretty gross."
82,I usually LOVE this place but have to give it a shitty review for the shitty service I got today. I merely wanted a freakin' box to carry my three slices of pizza and the guy gave me a lecture about how they are trying to save the forest for our children. WTF.  Pizza tasted good though.
83,I really have no idea why people line up for this stuff.  Their crust and pizza are really second-rate.  Gioia near Monterey Market is far superior.
84,"I generally really, really love pizza. I just don't understand why everyone loves the pizza here. There are so many other places around that are better- less greasy and with better flavors. I'm more confused than disappointed because of how highly it's rated!"
85,"WAY overpriced.  Doesn't even taste that good.. it's really greasy sometimes.   Not worth the hype.  Zachary's is a million times better.Also, no meat.  WHAT?  HELLO? MOST OF AMERICA ISN'T VEGETARIAN HIPPIES."
86,"I've heard about this place so much that I expected the pizza to be one of the New World Wonders.You get there on a Saturday noon, and the long line does nothing but strengthen the expectation.They were serving only one kind of pizza which helps the line move very fast. This is great. The volume of pizza they were moving also means that what you get is freshly out of the over, which *should have* made the pizza even better.But it just... wasn't... good.The pizza is very greasy, the cheese on it is good, it barely had any tomato sauce, and the crust was hard - not crunchy - like stale bread. My heart was broken."
87,"For $5.00 I got two completely charred (I took pix) wedges of pizza. Even if not burnt, the crust was thin and boring, none of the texture or flavor one would expect of, um, a bakery. The Roma tomatoes were cooked within an inch of their lives, so that left $2.50-worth of cheese and $2.50-worth of flavored oil.Hey, just down the road in Oakland, Arizmendi Bakery will deliver cheese, oil and more toppings on a real yeast-risen crust with one-quarter of the wait and attitude. Plus - no annoying UC students droning on and on about how standing in line is, like, bourgeois and sheep-like but actually totally worth it because my roommate's cousin's girlfriend who is actually a local, like from here, swears that this is, like, the awesomest pizza ever, and like, she oughtta know. Shut up!"
88,"I don't get the hype. This pizza is mediocre. Not terrible, not great. Sure the ingredients are fresh and unique but that's not enough to warrant these kinds of reviews or a line out the door. I've had a couple different types of pizza from here and it's always been just okay. Sometimes, the crust tastes like oily cardboard. Apparently they don't use real pizza ovens so the lack of a crisp and delicious crust makes sense. I love love love thin crust pizza, east coast style and this is a sad attempt at best. Save yourself a few bucks and make your own thin crust pizza at home in your oven and it'll probably be just as good with real, fresh ingredients..."
89,"Today's pizza: Fresh zucchini, onions, feta and mozzarella cheeses, topped with basil pesto. (PINENUTS in basil pesto). They only have one type of pizza a day, and it's all vegetarian, which I don't mind at all. So we decided to come here to get a whole pizza ($20) before the Big Game and bring it back to the apartment to chow down. The line wasn't too bad at all, and parking was easy to find. I expected a lot from Cheeseboard, as this was my first time there! Everyone always raves about how great it is. But when I got home and had my first bite, I was a little disappointed. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't GREAT. But supposedly their corn pizza is amazing, so I might change my review once I try that. The two stars is for the fact that I was disappointed, and I've had better pizza than this, and it's definitely not the cheapest either."
90,"The emperor has no clothes. This is one of the most overrated places in town, the pies here suck. Greasy as hell, salt/MSG laden, and completely tasteless.Notice every positive review is along the lines of ,,my friends and I...* and ,,we went to Cheeseboard...* or ,,from the fantastic reviews on Yelp...""Much like Paris Hilton, this talentless joint is famous for being famous.I'm convinced this is a social conformity experiment conducted by a psychology department somewhere. It wouldn't surprise me if there were hidden cameras filming these lemmings who stand in line and rave about the ,,fantastic"" food.Anyway, if you've ever been to Pink's Hotdogs in Hollywood, this is the same type of establishment. Everyone knows the Costco $1,49 kosher dog special (with a drink!) is much better than Pink's, but few have the balls to admit it.Over-hyped.One star for getting my order right."
91,"Trendy, gimmicky, crowded, and...WET. This place is only 'cool' because generations of CAL kids traditionally loitering in the area. Been here nearly ten times in the last six months, discarded at least 4 slices. I see everybody trying to power their way through whatever eccentric pizza is being offered that day with fake smiles and that 'Im gonna chuck this up later' cringe. Pickles and turkey bacon with currysauce and sweet potato is not an artistic homage to the pizza Gods. I'm convinced it is a staff-joke to see how much bizzare anti-pizza they can push to the hordes of drones they serve. The few decent slices I've had were soggy as hell also. There is far less parking on University ave. (and I usually have a trailer on my vehicle) but I will fight for a spot near Bobby G's (decent pizza/better crowd). I'm giving up on the Ol' cheeseboard. Somebody can send me a smoke signal if they ever offer some plain cheese or marg.Hats off, they do have their niche though."
92,"The pizza for Nov 8 was a real loser with mozarella and canned tomatoes. In fact the last 4 pizzas we've bought have been real disappointments. The crust has been too thick and sometimes the cheese is too much and too lumpy. And I have been a fan of the cheeseboard for over 20 years, but recently with so many new owners I feel the care and creativity and quality of the pizzas have gone way down. What a disappointment."
93,"Maybe we just went on a bad topping day, maybe our preferences aren't in tune with their pizza style, maybe our expectations were inflated by the hype this place has received, but either way, my friend and I didn't have our minds blown by the pizza we had.  It was by far the greasiest pizza (totally dripping - as if oil had been brushed/drizzled on, on top of what was already there), the toppings were unevenly and sparingly distributed, and just lacked a tart element to break up the heaviness of the cheese, oil, and bread.I also ordered a side salad, and though there was nothing remarkable about the veggies itself or the balsamic vinaigrette, the curry croutons were an interesting twist I've never had before.I think I'd give the place another shot, but I can get a similar fix closer to home at Pizzetta 211."
94,"Pizza is too salty for me. I didn't like the pizza at all, and I don't know why people would go there and wait on a long line. Oh well, I am not coming back here."
95,"Eh, doesn't taste like real pizza to me. More like cheese bread. Where's the sauce?"
96,"On a Friday, I decided to go there for lunch, thought to myself, maybe I should go after 13:00 so that it;s less crowded, but NOP, it's crowded at all times!!!!!-PROS:1) live music2) original atmosphere-CONS:1) only one type of pizza each day2) most of the time with allota garlic, so if you're allergic to garlic like me, basically there's no choice!TIPS:1) don't go there if you don't like garlic2) if you haven't already found a place to sit by the time you order, ask for it to go, so that you get it in a box and don't get to stand and eat until you find a place to sit!"
97,"Kind of a let down. Cheeseboard has been raved and raved about. But the three times I have eaten here, they have all been very dissappointing. The flavor is low-key, not much of a kick and the slices are small. It is definitely nothing to write home about. The prices is a bit more than other local pizza places and the lines are always ridiculous. In addition, it is always a hit or miss because they only have one flavor a day, so you can't even choose what kind of pizza you are gonna get. Pros:- Vegetarian- Hyped upCons:- Bland taste- Pricey- Long Wait Times- Small SlicesConclusion: Go somewhere else, unless you want to pay for an over-priced, under flavored small pizza slice."
98,"Being from the northeast, I know good pizza. From what I have tried throughout the state, California doesn't really have great pizza. I heard good things about the Cheeseboard pizza and thought I'd give it a try. One pie and one Coke came to $24. That's twice as much as I'd pay back east. But, I thought, maybe it's amazing and will be worth it. It wasn't. Average at best and waaaay over priced. Not sure why this place has such high reviews. It certainly can't be for the pizza."
99,"Hella greasy.... maybe i went there on the wrong day and got the wrong pizza because it wasn't all that!. We got the one with Potatos, carmelized onion and whatever else.... Their salad was awesome though =)Line was out the door...not enough seating...and they only take cash (but there is a bofa next door)  Staff was overwhelmed with the crowd and not very pleasant."
100,"Yeah, you go Berkeley.  I hate berkeleyens so much for worshipping places like this.  Lines around the block for a ""pizza"" that doesn't actually have pizza sauce or meat toppings.   Greasy cheese bread.  The cheese is really good, but I hate onions and the pizza always has onions.  And what kind of business can't keep regular hours?  I guess the kind that is run by it's employees.   Smug pretentious Berkeley vegetarian  yuppies can keep this place to themselves."
101,"Once upon a time this was my favorite pizza place in the Bay Area.  The last 2 times I've gone my pizza has been over-cooked.  One of the times it was over-cooked and also potentially left sitting out for 15 minutes, because it was getting that cold pizza crust rubberizing effect.Totally bummed, and unless this is just a fluke (new bakers?  new cooks?) I can't ever justifying going back."
102,"I guess we came on a bad day, but this thing was worse than the cardboard that I used to get (w/a side of corn and milk) at the cafeteria in high school.  It was India's Independence Day, so I guess the ""pizza of day"" (which I think is Communism) was something in the spirit of the event; curried potato...umm, nice thought, poor execution. The crust was worth 4 stars; and the band too.  I know the line moves quick with pre-made pie, but a hot out-of-the-oven pizza is much nicer.  This was pretty much tasteless.If you are going, check online to see what this place is serving up before you end up like we did yesterday."
103,"After reading all the raves & praise about this place, I'm unimpressed with the Yukon Gold potato, rosemary pizza that we had yesterday.   The flavors are good.  But the crust is too chewy and the oil level is too high.  It's good quality olive oil, but there is too much of it.Nice people, friendly old hippies, just like me.Still, I prefer Zachary's pizza over this place.___________________Update:  The next day I reheated the left over pizza in a regular oven. I expected the crust to crunch up a bit, instead it turned to really chewy rubber.  If Yelp had 1/2 stars in the rating scales, I'd deduct the score another 1/2 star for this pizza   borders on mediocre....Not recommended."
104,"Had it once. That was enough. Good location. That's all I can say in the positive.Holy greasy cardboard, Batman!"
105,"Right... I was brought here by a friend of a friend who goes to Cheeseboard at least once a week because she loves it so much...I have to say, I don't really think it lives up to the hype. Maybe it was hyped too much? The pizza was sort of underwhelming. The slice of the day was roasted potatoes, goat cheese, oregano, some other things. And the salad was kind of weird, as instead of dressing I got some pesto mixture. Which doesn't actually work as a salad dressing, because it's got more of a solid than a liquid consistency.The baby extra slice of pizza was cute though."
106,"SMUG ALERT!!!! If you drive a Prius, you will definitely love this place. Otherwise, it is just okay.I don't know, it's just average pizza with some organic ingredients. The people in line remind me of that south park episode about why San Francisco can be annoying. They sit in the median and glare at cars going by and look all goofy. It is also expensive like Lanesplitter. If you use rich ingredients like Feta and olive tapenade, it is going to be zesty, but not necessarily great, just okay..."
107,"Super hyped blandest pizza of the world:We live in the south bay and I combined the trip to Berkeley to visit my cousin along with eating cheeseboard pizza.  Gosh.  How disappointed we were.  There was no taste in it.  Not many vegetables.  No aroma.  It's all about cheese.  If you live in the cheese world and don't care anything other than the cheese smell and taste, this pizza is for you.  If you are looking anything more than that, this is not the place to try.  There was no sauce, no spice, no nothing.  I was super disappointed.  On top of it, you can't customize it in anyway making me more disappointed.  It's like what we give is what you eat.  Fine.  But what about if I like bit more spice on my pizza?  Bit more artichoke tips on my pizza?  Or could it be the pizza of the day?  I don't think so as after eating the Sat'day pizza and looking at the choices on the other days, they might not be to my taste too.  Just to give you a comparison, I love the Ciceros Pizza in San Jose for their thin crust, toppings, cheese and the taste.  I didn't see any of that stuff on Cheese Board pizza.  So why all that hype?  It's obviously for the different cheeses they top the pizza with.  And regarding the crust, it's in between the thin crust and the deep dish more towards the thinner side of it.Will I ever try this pizza even if I go back to Berkeley?  No chance.  Will I take my chances at Sliver?  No chance considering what I experienced at this place.  Then why two stars?  For their efficiency and cost."
108,"Got a combo to go.  If it's hot and fresh, then it is tolerable but if you put it in the fridge and have some the next day, it's really icky.  I just didn't think it was much better than a Papa Murphy type.  Just OK for me."
109,"Unfortunately I have to give this place a one because they were very rude that day.You know those awkward moments when a stranger jokes with you by insulting you, or tries a gimmick on you... Which you would have found funny if they were your friends, but's weird coming from someone you just met? My experience was a little like that.I came here with my roommate one day near closing at 3pm. It is our first time, and being unsure of how to order, my roommate asks what is available. Instead of simply saying what the pizza of the day is, the cashier curtly states, ""There is only one."" There is only one what? One Neo in the Matrix? One pizza left? One needle in the haystack? Ugh. It was potato, by the way. Anyway, we look to ourselves (slightly thrown off by his initial rudeness) and then towards the cashier and ask for a slice. The cashier flat out says ""No, you have to buy a whole box."" Uhh... Are you freal... He tells the manager to bring a whole box and they try to push the pizza onto us. When we say no thanks, they proceed towards the trashcan, as if to throw it away unless we bought it. What?!?! I'm already confused. Much awkward standing and awkward silence after that. I think it was supposed to be a joke but I'm not sure because they were all so serious. The cashier wraps two slices up for us, we pay and leave. The pizza is cold by now.Yeah, I don't know. I was disappointed by my visit."
110,Stand in line with the richest of yuppies in North Berkeley and discuss the various uses of arugula as you wait for a pizza that is the ultimate in pretentious culinary snobbery
111,"In the rest of the world, if you served someone cheese and veggies on cardboard people would not be interested. And yet day after day there are these people hanging outside of cheeseboard waiting feverishly for the boutique pizza of the day.Let's dissect this place a bit further. One: anything that has super hype in Berkeley is probably not that good (chez panisse and some other establishments an exception). Two: just because people have an ethical and interesting business model does not mean that their food is good. Three: since when does pizza mean cheese on bread...where the hell is the sauce? Honestly, I could not believe this place when I had it. I mean really. Like really people? This is the best Berkeley has to offer?Now, if you want a good meal and are interested in supporting the cheeseboard, go next door to the cheese shop, sample some cheeses (preferably with the guidance of one of their knowledgable employees), and buy one of their fresh breads (the olive/tomato/caper focaccia is particularly good)."
112,"I must be missing something here. I thought the pizza I ate was rather gross. It was really greasy and tasted like burnt cheese. I also had to scrape off layers upon layers of garlic. I am a fan of garlic but this shit was really over the top. At the risk of insulting a bay area favorite, I'm gonna go ahead and say that this place isn't very good.Little Star is infinitely better as is Zachary's, granted those are different styles of pizza but still. A more relevant comparison would be Arizmendi, which for the record, I found to be much better too. I was recently informed that this is a sister co-op of Arizmendi, so I'm not sure why I found it to be teh ungood."
113,"Going to Cheeseboard is like playing Russian-roulette.  Okay, so maybe you aren't taking your life into your own hands every time you go, but you are risking throwing away precious moments of your life.  I like the novelty idea of serving a different type of pizza every day, but I as a paying customer, I need to be given a choice.  Unfortunately, the only choice Cheeseboard gives you is their way or the highway: the only pizza you can purchase is their daily special.  If I attend their establishment on the day they serve a topping I disagree with?  To effing bad.I appreciate the unconventional business model Cheeseboard uses and the ingredients are fresh.  However, this place just isn't for me.  To me, ordering a pizza is something sacred: it's about getting a hot slab of baked dough with select toppings of my choice.  Why should I be paying an arm and a leg for junk I don't want?Obviously Cheeseboard elicits a lot of fanfare from their average customer and puts out a quality product.  On average, I don't like a majority of their pizzas because they tend to use olive oil as a base spread instead of a tomato sauce.  I highly recommend looking up the pizza of the day in advance from their website or a phone call so you can decide for yourself if their brand of pizza is worth your patronage before going there."
114,"Came here last night to eat and was impressed with the service and the decor.However, the pizza was terribly over-salted and the garlic overwhelmed the number of fresh ingredients that were there. The blue cheese stood out to me every now and then, which was great, but only at the very end of the meal did I realize that they had used a sourdough crust. And this was because I had taken a break from eating for a while. What's the point of using fresh ingredients when you are going to cover them up with salt and garlic?"
115,Cool vibe here but pizza was not that good. Maybe it was just the day we went but i was not impressed with the pizza at all. Extremely oily.
116,"Great food for sure.  Love the concept.  Love how the menu is limited but changes daily.  Love how fast I got my food and how delicious it was.I went with three friends one day when there was live music.  Kudos for live music but I seriously could not hear one word during my entire meal because it was so obnoxiously loud...and I am never one to complain about music in restaurants etc.Lost lots of stars for me by the amount of WASTE!!!!  We ordered a pizza and four salads to eat there (not to go).  We got four big obnoxious plastic containers with salad, four plastic salad dressing containers with lids, four plastic forks and four plastic cups for water!  WHAT IS THIS IN THIS DAY AND AGE!!!!!!!!  Have a little Berkeley consciousness Pizza Collective!  I am not a hard core crunchy granola freak but this sheer amount of waste bugged the shit out of me.  Think how much waste this produces in a day...a year.  I will not go back based solely on this."
117,"The pizza is pretty darn good. The atmosphere is amazing. The public ridicule? That I can do without.Last time I went to Cheeseboard, the guy at the cash register rang me up like this, ""OK, so that'll be two slices of pizza and 46 grams of sugar."" I was buying a soda. Or attempting to, anyway. He must not have realized that he was working at a COLLECTIVE and was calling me out for purchasing an item HE was personally selling. So he went on to ask, ""Are you sure you need all that?'Next time I'll skip the pizza too."
118,"I don't know what the hype is all about.  I came all excited to come here after all the glowing reviews.  I had the pizza special of the day, which was chili, pepper, leeks, Fontina and Gorgonzola with scallions.  It came promptly and steaming hot, but I wasn't too impressed.  The crust was thin and slightly crunchy, and the ingredients were undoubtedly fresh and contributed to the high quality feel of the pizza in bite and taste.  However, it seems like something that I could make at home.  With fresh dough and high quality ingredients, one could really make this for oneself.  $22 for a whole pizza is also really way too much.  I think I prefer Costco pizza instead.  Now that's a bargain and when it's done right, is what I'd prefer over Cheeseboard.The ambiance is true to form upscale ""gourmet"" in feel and clean though, and contemporary with some kind of Berkeley flair with pale cream colored sponge-pressed walls and fresh flowers tucked away on the side.  Apparently, live bands perform jazz and contemporary music in the corner for the restaurant various days and provides an appealing atmosphere to munch your $2.50 pizza.  The annoying Hussein NObama stand on the sidewalk outside doesn't make the pizza taste any better though."
119,"pizza is garbage with oil...overrated, overpriced, over appreciated....ASININE!"
120,"I think this review might cost me my chance of attaining elite status, but I TRIED to like this place.  I have gotten their pizza a few times over the past two years and have always been confused about the hype.  But today, I decided to give the last third of my pizza slice to my boyfriend who loves this place and asked him to get me a salad.  It sounded so good - spinach,  fennel, etc.  But the leaves were dirty.  Really, really dirty.  Even my bf stopped trying to convince me it was black pepper after examining a leaf of arugula.  I picked out the really dirty leaves and ate the rest, and have been paying for trying to be a good sport all day.  Two stars for mediocre pizza and a great Inauguration Day Party."
121,"TWO words ""over rated"".Seriously WTF is wrong with people in Berkeley!? Waiting in line for an hour to get a slice of one type of pizza that The Cheeseboard Staff decides on. Yes, there are no options for choosing what kind of pizza here folks. You have to buy the pizza they want to make.  Then you can sit in the middle of the road to enjoy it. Wonderful experience. The pizza here is not even GOOD!!!!. My husband and I are convinced that they put crack in the pizza so that the Berkeley yuppies will keep coming back."
122,"One star for the concept, one star for the live music. I know that people are obsessed with this pizza (the huge line says it all), but honestly? It was super greasy the first time I tried it (some sort of potato pizza), and super greasy the second time I tried it yesterday (mushrooms, spinach, pine nuts). I would say the pizza was dry bc there is no sauce, but actually there is oil running off of it...so I guess it isn't. The crust is slightly sour (I'm not sure it was a sour dough based crust, but disclaimer, I don't like sour dough) and was burnt, and I'm more of a fan of sauce of my pizza"
123,"This place makes REALLY good round flatbread. The toppings are fresh and change every day. I was pretty disappointed by this ""pizza"" collective though. I'm no expert but I think pizza is what they have at Emilia's... you know, those things with tomato sauce."
124,"Their pizza is nothing special, really!Their cheese selection is vast, which is good.  But first you need to get through the snotty attitude of the people staffing the cheese area.The breads are good."
125,"Saw a line down the street and expected something amazing. What we got was the greasiest pizza we have ever had and had no choice on what type we wanted as they only serve one style a day, cause you know, serving other pizzas is a real hassle making them fresh and all."
126,"Idont know what people are talking about , pizza was horrible, tasted like cardboard, it was not for me.  i hate to give a bad review.  I did not like the bread crust, maybe im not a yuppy foody"
127,"OMG They're never open for me for some reason.  I love the food there, but I make the drive out there and it's always closed.  Even during their regular hours, they run out or something!  I haven't gotten pizza the last 5 times I've tried.  Super crappy.Food is great and everything when they are open.  But I can't believe how they close earlier than their hours say, and have the oddest holiday vacations too."
128,"3 stars for the overly cheesy pizza, 1 star for the nonexistent service (I don't mind paying at the counter, but at least give me the right receipt and don't send me looking for the previous customer to exchange receipts -- and then find out his was correct -- for Julia Child's sake!)."
129,"Really not all that, was expecting much more as far as the pizza goes.But loved the vibe, loved the live jazz, super quick (even with the lines) and pretty cheap for fresh, natural tasting pizza.  It seems to be a well running, successful co-op assembly line, because they have pizza's (but only one kind - whatever the pizza of the day is) coming out of the oven nonstop for the endless hoards, er, lines and lines of cute Berkeley-ites.  A cool business model, wonder if it'd work for anything else.  Just wish the pizza was more special.  It's just normal cheesy semi-thin crust pizza.  The sourdough crust was kinda nice, but still, nothing special unless you're comparing it to one of the dirty bland chains.  For good pizza, i'm sticking to Delfina and Little Star in the city.  Berkeley's got trees, but apparently not pizza... sorry cute Berkeley-ites.UPDATE UPDATE NEXT MORNING:Well, my friend was not feeling good the next morning.  Really not good.  Go with caution, know yourself, don't eat the over 3 slices.  (Minus one star)."
130,"OKay, I have only been here one time, so you have to take that into account. I just don't get what everyone is talking about. I found the pizza to be mediocre and really greasy. The cheese to be okay tasting but nothing to rave about.  Hearing all the great reviews I bought two slices too.  Nothing remarkable.I guess I must have gone there on an off day?"
131,"Prices are reasonable at $2.50 a slice... Lines move quickly... I tried this place because of all the positive feedback, but it just wasn't impressive. The special was a three cheese, three onion pizza. I found it to be way too salty and oily. The combination wasn't very good. I don't like the idea of standing in a line and just getting what ever they plan to serve that day either. Not my style, but apparently other love this place. Just don't know why. I think the low prices and atmosphere draw in the UC Berk students. I doubt this restaurant would survive elsewhere. That is why Berkeley is so great."
132,"Okay, the pizza is tasty, don't get me wrong. (But it's not ambrosia either).  I give cheese board 2 stars simply because it bugs the hell out of me. My god, people talk about this place as if one should pray in it's direction 6 times daily.  Of course, I would like to go there more and try more flavors and they annoyingly cook only 1 type a day, BUT they have these ridiculously short hours. Now, I understand in a supply and demand economy, with these minions as slaves to the beck and call of the lord that is cheese board, they can afford to be open any time they want. Hell, they can be open 1 hour a day and probably would still do great.Also they made me pay with cash, and I'm sorry but this is the 21st century and people use check cards! Argh. The fact that their hours are ridiculous, they always have a line of worshipful groupies, and have a snotty (yes, we're that good) wait staff is just intolerable. That level of annoyance and hassle makes me want to go down the street and have a burger."
133,Their pizza sucks and gave me a stomach ache.
134,"I don't have to wait in the long lines to know this ain't pizza, it's cheese toast.  I know I'm in the minority these days, but I don't find it funny to put potatoes, yams, corn, cilantro,  pears or pine nuts on my toast, er... pizza."
135,"The most overrated place in Berkeley. They only have one type of ""pizza"" per day (if you call something without tomato sauce ""pizza""), and it's always a greasy disgusting pile random ingredients."
136,"They do make the best stollen, but that's only once a year (Christmas). Although this year, the rum flavor is lacking. It's better than La Farine's (the only other version I've tried). Although La Farine's version has marzipan, it does not make up for the citrus, fragrance, flavor, and texture of Cheeseboard's (which was better last year because of the noticeable touch of rum). La Farine uses granulated sugar whereas Cheeseboard uses confectioner's sugar.The hazelnut shortbread here are the best. It has improved since a few years ago when consistency was not quite there--sometimes they seemed not baked enough to give it that right crisp texture. I've tried shortbread from Bakesale Betty's, which tends to be sweeter. I think Cheeseboard's hazelnut shortbread has that right nutty flavor and crisp texture. It freezes well; let it come up to room temperature so that the flavor does not seem off.12/30/2008After letting the half-eaten stollens sit for a few days, I can see where La Farine's trumps Cheeseboard's: It is still just as moist (perhaps due to the rum?) whereas Cheeseboard's is getting dry and stale.Cheeseboard bakers need to improve the consistency of its shortbread. It was excellent the past two weeks, but the 2-lbs I got today were not crisp (too much butter or under-baked?), have fewer hazelnuts, and the flavor tasted floury.Frustrating!"
137,"I don't know who's planning the menus these days, but until they get more consistent, I'm downgrading Cheeseboard from overrated to inedible.  Who layers a soggy, sauceless crust with greasy eggplant, cheese, and more eggplant?  Why, for the love of god, put olive oil on cheese?  I once bought a celeste frozen pizza from 7/11 and it was much worse than that.  I ported it home in my bag and my bag is now saturated with eggplant grease."
138,"Well, I guess I'm the odd person here because I don't like the pizza. I went in last week and my pizza had little flavor, but the real problem was the sogginess of the slice. My slice  was just plain  oily.  Believe me, I WANT to like the pizza as the atmosphere is great, nice music, friendly people, clean, generous slices and all, but I'm picky about my pie.FOR THE BEST PIZZA IN BERKELEY, GO TO GIOIA PIZZA AT 1586 HOPKINS. YOU CAN ORDER A VARIETY OF PIZZA BY THE SLICE, BOTH VEGETARIAN AND WITH MEAT.  THEY ONLY USE THE BEST CHEESE."
139,"Way too much hype over this place.Where's the meat?I left feeling hungry still for what I paid.Why so crowded?Damn the homeless people all hitting me up out front like it was their daily acceptable activity.And those pesky Go Green kids trying to get me to sign up for stuff.anyways, if you want pizza instead of doing all this for some corn and whatever pizza try ordering it from somewhere that delivers!"
140,"I remember being completely turned off by the sauceless pizzas that are so abundant in the Northern California sensibility after taking my first bite at Cheeseboard.Then I got out a little more and realized that it was Cheeseboard that I didn't like.  I love sauceless pizzas.  I've been three times now and the pizzas really don't stand out.  I mean, if you're just going to make one pizza a day, it should really pop.  I find the flavors flat and that either the ingredients themselves are not strong enough or that the cheese is just overwhelming.  Crust is nothing special."
141,"No sauce?  Then it's not a pizza, it's a round cheese toast.  And it seems like no matter what the pie of the day is, there is onion overkill.  The cash-only policy is pretty silly, too.But, there was this one time, when we forgot about the cash only policy, and the guy let us take the pizza anyway.  ""Just bring the money tomorrow.""  Which we did.  That was really nice of him."
142,"Novelty of rotating menu is cool, the special pie  they were  serving today was a concoction of olive spread parsley bell peppers etc. Nice looking pizza but something in the pizza was incredibly salty!! For me good food should have a blend of complimentary flavors. Salty olive spread was overpoweringpls b aware that seating is limited but plenty of space on the grass in the middle of the street where you will b joined by an eclectic mix of uc Berkeley students"
143,"I'm in shock this place got such high reviews.  It was extremely mediocre to bad.  As a NYer of many years, I love a good pizza.  I also appreciate real Italian pizza (very different from NY pizza but awesome in its own way).This pizza was too greasy, the crust did not taste fresh and the overall taste was actual so poor no one in my family, not even my KIDS, ate it - and when don't kids eat pizza? As a family that can always finish off a pizza, we threw out half.Emilia's in Berkeley is MUCH better."
144,"I've always thought this place was overrated. I dig the politics, and their 'za du jour is always innovative, and usually tasty (although, even as a quasi-gourmand, I have to say that sometimes creative does not equal complementary. I'm looking at you, corn and blue cheese).But.The line's always really, really long. Disparagingly so. And I always end up sandwiched between a couple SCUMIs (Socially Conscious Until Money's Involved) whining and moaning about a lack of funding for the arts before driving their beamers back up to their $2 million Victorians in the hills. Which isn't the Cheeseboard's fault, I know, but it's part of the experience. By the time I bite into my slice I already have a headache from eye-rolling, and the intense mastication required to get through their dry crusts only makes that worse.When I want weird pizza, I just go to Arizmendi's. The line's much shorter, the crust is softer, and the hipsters are poorer."
145,"Seriously people who form lines patiently out there, are lacking those buds in their tongues that separates a good flavor from a bad one. Pizza is greasy, really really far from italian, the bread feels like fried. Its good that they change the menu's daily but honestly, I had a slice and that slice only upset my stomach."
146,"This is not pizza. no sauce no meat. Its cheese bread. No choices here, they tell you what you will have.  they are like like the soup nazzi from sienfeild. i would rather go to a place that atleast will let me decide what i want to eat"
147,"Delicious crust but ... dripping with oil, crust too thick for my liking and barely any flavor. i tried the corn and cilantro, which sounded amazing. There was so much oil, I don't think there were enough napkins in the place to soak it all up. I took my piece of pizza and hung it in the air by the crust over my napkin and it literally poured oil all over the napkin! The corn was sweet and crunchy but the cilantro was bland and flavorless, making this more a corn and oil pizza. Overall I was very disappointed and will not go back =("
148,"Of course you can't deny there is good stuff here. I have a problem with the holier than thou attitude. I happen to like red sauce, sue me! I am also allergic to onions and if onions are on the pizza that night well then screw me. Naaaaa."
149,"Yes, everyone is going to think I'm crazy for not liking Cheeseboard pizza.  Well, let me explain... then you can continue to think I'm crazy.I've spent many years in New York eating the BEST pizzas.  So I like pizzas that have tomato sauce - I know, shocking.  Yes, I realize that Cheeseboard pizza should not be judged against NY-style pizzas.  But still... a pizza without tomato sauce!?So why 2 stars? Because of the lack of any sauce (olive oil does not count).  The crusts always turn out a little too crispy and their daily flavours often taste the same.  Except the pizza with the lemon zest - that pizza is actually good."
150,"There is soo much hype about this place and honestly I don't think the pizzas here are all that great.  I have been here about 5 different times and have been disappointed each time.  The pizza I got have been very, very oily - the oil literally drops down my arm!  The crust is very tough and dry.  They put a lot of unique toppings but the crust is so thin and doesn't have much taste.  One time the pizza tasted so damn salty I ended up giving the rest to some guy asking for change on the side walk.  A lot of my friends love this place but honestly I won't go back again.  I also think the customer service here sucks, I never once got a 'thank you' or 'have a nice day' - yes I know they are busy but I honestly feel that they don't appreciate my business.  All I hear is the employees yelling ""next, next"" like its some kind of butcher shop.  Definitely not a place for me."
151,ya'll are crazy.Pretty tasty toppings but they make the pizza crust out of their sourdough bread dough so it's kinda dense chewy and despicable.pizza snobs unite and talk these hypesters back down to earth.
152,"When I first came to Berkeley 4 years ago, I loved Cheeseboard pizza.  Going on ambiance alone, they would get 5 stars.  I love the elderly jazz trio that plays there.  But the pizza just seems to get worse.  It's too oily, the crust is increasingly unappetizing, and they seem to be in love with a zucchini-feta combination that has gotten pretty old.  Maybe if you're walking down Shattuck and need a quick bite, it'll do, but if you're interested in buying a half or whole pie, go to Gioia's Pizzeria by the Monterey market.  Their pizza is ten times better."
153,The chese hippies must be putting weed in their Pizza or the patrons are breathing too much car exhaust while eating their pizza in the middle of Shattuck.  I have no idea how this place got such a high rating.  Pizza without meat....WTF?  The card board box  from a Zachary's pizza trumps this shit any day.....
154,"Ok, so my partner and I have been there a handful of times. I'd been there a few times years ago. 10 years ago it was really good. Now it's either good, or bland and chewy.There's a cheese shop around the corner, full of choices and options, but apparently this hasn't inspired the pizza shop to much variety from week to week. And the attitude from some of the staff..."
155,"Do you like...?A) Pizza topped with fresh ingredients?B) Pizza topped with tasty gourmet cheeses?C) Pizza piping hot and ready to eat?D) Pizza so logged with grease that the crust is floppy and mushy, and sounds like ""squish, squish"" when you bite into it?Today I stood in line for a slice of this notorious pizza.  The line was long, and I looked like hell wearing sweaty gym clothes (I figured a workout merited some pizza).  You know reviews of this place are good if I'm actually going to stand around in public looking the way I did.  I think there was also a grease blob on my stinky, sweaty sweatshirt.  That's how badly I should have been in the shower instead of standing around for pizza in Berkeley's gourmet ghetto.  Needless to say, I was thinking the pizza had better be good.  Alas, though statements a), b), and c) are all true and should make for a delectable pizza pie, statement d) rang the truest, and ruined my cheeseboard pizza experience.  Where these other Yelpers are getting the idea that anything about this pizza's grease-sponge crust is ""crispy"" I do not know.  I doubt I will go back.  This pizza strikes me neither as ""the best in Berkeley"", nor even as anything that stands out.  It certainly does not strike me as being remotely near option F) New York style pizza."
156,"The menus have hardly changed in years, the bouncy friendliness has gradually trickled away and been replaced with quite the attitude from some of the staff--It is apparently a privilege to experience one of their slices. There are days when the pizzas are great, other days, you wonder why they bothered getting out of bed to make chewy onion flat bread. They can't seem to maintain their website enough to keep the public consistently informed of their daily fare--and this unlike their sister establishments in Oakland and SF. They're resting on their doughy laurels. Amazingly, with a cheese shop next door, you'd think that some original thought might waft along a ripe breeze to the pizza end, but alas no."
157,"I used to be really into this place.  For years, I've put up with the socialist nonsense that this place represents, but I can only take so many burnt pizzas before I just have to simply give up.  Now that Little Star is on Solano, I've moved on.  To put it in terms that Cheeseboard might understand, unlike people, all pizzas are not created equal."
158,"Look, the pizza's just not all that amazing. Ambience...5 stars. Coolness factor? 5 stars. Neat to listen to live music? 5 stars. Actual tasty pizza? Nothing to write home about."
159,"Boooo! I fell for the hype of this place. Waited in line for awhile, which is the norm. Pizza was boring, and *gasp* vegetarian. I was not aware that this was a no-meat-pizza place. I should have known in Berkeley. Even though there was no meat, I was prepared for something great. I am not sure what everybody is talking about with this place. It was nothing special. I think Berkeley people just love their local stuff, so they are a bit jaded. Not great at all."
160,"oh really? is this ""that"" cheesboard? way overrated. price is better than reasonable, but.."
161,"I love the actual Cheeseboard but the popularity of the pizza annex baffles me. All this hype, for what - some soggy slices that have been sitting around  too long? I have no idea what you people are thinking. Go to Zachary's instead."
162,"they ruin and muddle pizza by trying too hard, using too many toppings with clashing flavors.  the crust is OK.  don't trust pizza west of the appalachians"
