0,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
1,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
2,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
3,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
4,"Not once have I stepped into this place during my time at Cal, but I've heard the raves of this place over the years. So, at long last, I went with one of my besties (who loves this place).The first thing I noticed was the glasses of water placed before us. Our cups were dusty! My friend noted, ""That must've been from the linen they used to wipe the cups,"" but who the Hell would wipe cups with cloth that sheds???Then, we made our decisions of what to order, set down our menus, and dived into girltalk...*spoken in the Spongebob voice*...20 minutes later...ME: Wait, why hasn't anyone stopped by to take our order?FRIEND: Oh yeah, you're right...It was a busy Saturday night, but that's no reason to neglect a party of two.When a waiter did come around, we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with medium-level spice and Garlic Naan. Everything tasted bland.My friend loves the gulab juman for dessert, and we were waiting around for a waiter, since I wanted to try a good gulab juman (we went to another place where it was soggy and cold, with terrible service). But while we waited, I thought, ""If the food is nothing special already, and the service is so slow here, why would the gulab juman stand out?""Decided not to get gulab juman. Signed our checks and left."
5,Ordered the Tandoori Shrimp.It wasn't good.  The dhal was watery and bland.  Rice seemed reheated.  Vegetables were hard and flavorless.  Not good.  Online ordering system requires payment upfront even if you're using a Groupon.
6,"We wanted to have some Nepali food, it was good greetings and all those stuffs while we just entered, we ordered our foods, momo .......... after like 25 minutes I had to go to restroom, when I came back all of my left over was taken I was so pissed off the intro was good body was ok but the main thing conclusion was horrible. I will never ever go back to this place and u know what their momo sucks and it's freaking expensive, I know it's Berkeley downtown the rent is high but at least the food should be good enough, but it's bad I don't know I guess it's only for us I don't have any issues with the workers or the owner or anyone related to this restaurant I am just saying what we felt like"
7,"BEWARE: 6/23/16Food was aight, and I'd probably come back again if I had a normal experience, but I think I got food poisoning because I woke up at 4AM and my stomach was NOT happy.I've gotten food poisoning in the past from eating various types of street food in different countries, but this was a first in the US. Definitely disappointed."
8,"Right in ""Gourmet Ghetto"" of Berkeley, this place attracts all the newcomers to the area and their decor is quite inviting. Their food was OK, but their service has definitely gotten better over the years. I went here a total of three times. Each time the food quality seemed like they tossed in the few pieces of meat and heated it up on the stove. The meat pieces clearly didn't  simmer long enough in the gravy or soup base they came with to have that flavor permeate throughout the pieces of meat. So. Yeah. Having eaten a hundreds of restaurants over the years, I know the difference between meat that is actually *cooked* in the gravy that it came with, or just a few pieces of meat were tossed in and heated up with the gravy. Maybe it is because this particular ethnic food group takes a lot of preparation."
9,"Sad that this place is not as good as our first visit. First time we came, they had just opened and had some good deals and food. This last time though was no good. Really long wait for food, found hair in the samosas, really pricey for the portion size, and not that flavorful. Seems like they didn't develop as great as hoped (or more customers and demand got them stooping to lower standards). I personally have been to many Indian restaurants way better. Highlights:-pretty paintings-good garlic naan: good flavor here, cooked well, hot when served. it was the best part!Drawbacks:-slow service: it wasn't even that busy the night we went, but still waited 30-40 mins for a dish that supposedly had been stewing all day, so should have been brought out easy and quick.- poor flavor: nothing notable. seemed way too basic compared to the description and expectations. we ordered the goat curry, which was described as stewing all day in lots of spices. did not taste that at all.- again, hair in samosas :( also, barely warmed when we got them. on the plus side, they brought out a fresh one which was actually hot.- no chutney! just tamarind sauce. we asked for something else with more spice (tamarind sauce was pretty sweet). nada.- too pricey: for the experience and quality of food, the price was not worth it.Sadly, will not go back. Seems like they are catering too much to a particular palate that is not tuned into this type of food. I've had a lot of Indian food from many places. If you are an experienced eater also looking for good quality Indian food, I would NOT recommend this place. womp womp!"
10,"The wait for the food was 60 minutes. The food quality was very mediocre. Tried tandoori chicken and it was not worth it. After waiting one hour for the food, there was no apology nor smile or anything."
11,"The service was very good.  Our server was attentive, friendly, smiling and even thanked us for coming.  He always refilled our water glasses.   The man who seem to be the owner was nice too.The menu prices were expensive.  The mixed momo (3 pieces of dumplings each of vegetable, lamb, and chicken) $10.95 were dry, not plump and juicy.  It came with a small bowl of tomato chutney.  The dumplings are small.  The photo looks deceiving.The naan was thick and comes with one cut up into four pieces.  I'm used to the naan being thinner at other Indian restaurants.  The Chicken Nauni $14.95 was good but small portion.  Comes with basmati rice or naan.The Mixed Tandoori $20.95 was good but not worth $20.95.  It's too expensive.  It came with 2 pieces of tandoor chicken, boti kabab (Lamb), shrimp tandoor, and chicken tikka and served in a sizzling hot plate with sautéed onions, bell pepper, cabbage, carrot, and spinach.  Comes with basmati rice or naan.  The Lamb Biryani $15.95 which is basmati rice cooked with lamb, herbs and spices was ok. Not sure if I'll be back."
12,food here is very inconsistent. The soup always needs salt and the naan comes out burnt about 50% of the time.The curries are ok but for the price it's not worth it.
13,"Long wait. Food is really bad, worst Himalayan restaurant I've tried. Chicken TikaMasala, Chicken Biryani, Okra dish and Kheer is very bad."
14,This was a rather disappointing lunch experience.  Walking in for lunch around 100pm ... It was pretty slow ... Waited a moment for someone to come out and seat us . We were handed  menus and glasses of water . Looking at the menu. We needed up ordering  vegetable samosas and one of their entrees to share . The menu states that  every entree gets a bowl of lentil soup and a choice of brown or basmati rice or pain nann .... We ordered the garlic nann thinking we could upgrade to the garlic and pay difference ... The samosas came out just a few min before the entree .. They were two  big warm samosas served with a tamarind sauce ... It was good but not amazing  and I wish they had a mint sauce to go along with the sweet  tamarind sauce ... Usually places have them . Anyway on to the main entree ... We did NOT get our bowl of lentil soup !  Idk I should have said something but you know when sometimes your just so disappointed with an experience that's it's just not even worth the energy to say anything? I'm not sure if that makes sense but anyway that's how I felt . The garlic nann bread we got was an extra 4.95 to the bill .  It was one large flat piece cut into four ... It barely had any flavor and was very very dry . The rice that they just happen to choose for us .. We didn't ask for the rice cuz we thought the garlic nann would replace it .. Was tasteless and again very dry . The tiki masla sauce was good but the chicken was over done and DRY !!   It was just an underwhelming dinning :(
15,I went with high expectations. I left flattened!Service: Pretty bad - the server was argumentative and had no clue about customer experience.Food: Pretty bad - the goat curry lacked complexity of flavors and the meat was chewy and undercooked. The Chilli Chicken was sub-standard. Naan - all flour.. and nasty!! I have never tasted naan so bad. Ever. The rice was cooked nicely... the daal was OK but served lukewarm. Amateurs at best!Prices: More expensive than most Indian restaurants in all of the bay area. One trip too many. The Himalayas taste a lot better than this TOTH.
16,"I have to say, this is a mixed bag review for me. Having had worse, the food was pretty good...at first. The delivery driver (Grub Hubed it) came to the door and explained they were out of their yogurt dip Raita. However, they could not credit me or exchange anything for the cost (so out the cost apparently). The food, plentiful with mixed tandoori, which came with a tasty lentil soup, tossed salad, lamb momo (dumplings) and a couple other speciaties which I enjoyed...at first. Then...the dreaded one hair (and certainly not of mine) in the salad. I can get past it I thought, holding back the reflex to heave, and so just moved on. Then about three bites into the tandoori dish, yep another (pitch black and about 4-5"" long)., then another. Started to think the chef had mange. Anyway, that pretty much ruined my dinner, but the dog had a good time.Figured I will call and make a formal complaint but don't want to act like I have a hair up my...uh hem."
17,"In a nut shell; Food is really mediocre, and they need to learn something about courtesy in treating their guests...I definitely won't be going there any more, especially that Berkeley have a Merida of far superior restaurants offering the same cuisine..,"
18,I had read a lot of glowing reviews of the momos here. I was frankly very disappointed with the food. Let me tell you why. First and foremost the momos tasted like they were stale and cooked a few nights before. I must emphasize that I was there during lunch time. They could very well have heated up the leftovers from last night. The momos were lukewarm and had bit of a sour/tangy taste to it. Coming from Nepal I know what good momos taste like. And this my friends was certainly not one of them. At Least not for lunch anyways. The only thing good about the momos was just the sauce. Sauce = 5 stars momo = 0 stars. Aggregate = 1 star.
19,"Got take out from here because of the Groupon deal. The food is definitely created for the American palette, and is definitely pricey given the quality of it. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. There are definitely way better places in Berkeley. Even Mint Leaf right up the street is better than this."
20,"Have to agree with most of the recent reviews I read.  Friendly service, but dinner did take too long to come out.  None of the dishes were bursting with flavor, and overall the result was ""meh"".  Green tea was literally hot water and a tea bag.   Was seated near the door, and proceeded to get blasted by cold wind every time the door was opened.  Came here for moms birthday, and sadly this place didn't create any memories."
21,"Decor is nice but the ""free"" lentil soup is pretty nasty and the curries don't have any flavor. They definitely overcharge though as their portion sizes are small and naan is extra. I also ordered a glass of red wine but when they served it, it had gone corked (ie spoiled). I notified them and they gave me more wine (not the one I wanted, but something they said was 'a very good one' whatever that means) which would have been fine BUT THEN THEY STILL CHARGED ME $7 FOR IT. Why would I pay for something that you served spoiled, and then didn't have a new bottle of the actual wine I wanted?"
22,"I've been here several times, and it is a consistent Indian restaurant. The food is okay, but the main reason I only give to stars is that it is also underwhelming. There are no real highlights. The food is decent, but not great, the atmosphere is ok, but not really inviting, you get a decent amount of food for your money, but it is still on the more expensive side. Remembering that this restaurant is in Berkeley's gourmet ghetto, it is really not enough. One major turn-off are the steel metal plates for lunch. It looks more like a cafeteria or prison than a restaurant."
23,This was okay but really not sure why it has 4 stars.  The menu was interesting but the food was luke warm and a bit bland.  I asked for medium spicy and it was not spicy at all.Definitely had better indian food with better service.  It is not terrible but definitely not 4 stars
24,"What the actual hell? My bf had a restaurant.com $25 where we had to sped a min of $37 or something. I normally don't like Indian food but my bf loves it and even lived in India for a summer in the past. We ordered the somosa, mixed momo, garlic naan and mixed tandoori. The somosa and complimentary lentil soup came first. We didn't finish the somosas bc they weren't that noteworthy but the chutney sauce wasn't bad and save the dish. We waited what seemed forever for the rest of our food.While waiting I noticed this huge fly on the wall next to my bf. I pointed it out to him and we shooed it away but it kept coming back. The girl behind her started freaking out bc at some point there were two huge flies. My bf and I moved one table over and the couple behind us moved across the restaurant. I understand that the restaurant can't do much for flies but it's still really gross considering what flies usually land on.... The waiting continues at the new table..... Literally two couples that came after us, came and went. We asked our waitress about our momo and she said it was coming.... 15 min later we asked again and finally the naan and mixed tandoori came. We thought it was weird that the main dish came before the other appetizer. But we were hungry so we dug in  The mixed tandoori was super bland and was mostly chicken with only one small piece of lamb and 2 pieces of shrimp. I'll give them a point for cooking the chicken so it was tender but take it away again for being bland. My bf had to ask for sauce to eat it. We asked about the momo and it was obvious they forgot about it. We asked for it to go instead and continued to eat our food.... 20 min later and the momo is STILL not there. They cleared the table, we paid and we continued to wait. I was literally pulling my hair out and one of the waitresses came over like .... Hmm is there anything else I can do? Uh.... Our momo!? Her: oh it's coming SURE WE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE At this point we were like what IS this momo !? In the car we opened it up and it is literally dumplings... an hour to make dumplings... Were they making them fresh during that hour or something ? Well we will be eating them for breakfast tmrw and I hope they're mind blowing."
25,"HAH! so funny story, after I wrote an honest review of my experience at Taste of Himalayas, the owner reached out to me. Aside from apologizing for the rude services and the craze that the menopause woman went out on my party & I, Rajen (the owner) accused me of being abrupt in my choice of words. Hm, okay.... no where in my review did I used any profanity...(except in my assumption, HA -- but hey, at least i quoted it ;) ) nor did I made the rating without a thorough explanation for why I did so. I write what I feel, and besides, Yelp is for customers to draft their honest opinion on their experiences, not to buffer and skew their negative experiences so that the Owners can feel better about themselves. Well, I'm sorry, but this isn't a testimony for your website so you can rave to your customers about great and wonderful your restaurant is. I'm sorry that you didn't like my review and I'm sorry that I ""upset your workers"". Your workers wouldn't have been upset in the first place, if she did her job well. I mean, if you are not a people-person, I suggest you get out of the Customer-Service industry. Better yet find a job that are more competence with your Type A personality. Possibly for the DMV or somewhere in a corner so you don't have to deal with customers, like myself (: Last but not least, I'm sorry Rajen, I can't simply delete my review nor edit it to your taste. First of all, as the Owner, it is YOUR responsibility to try and accommodate ME. (so why am I saying Sorry so much ?? sigh, i guess I just believe in forgiveness a little too much as well)Maybe it was MY fault for coming to your restaurant in the first place expecting good services. You should probably put up a ""WE HAVE POOR SERVICES, SO DON'T BE SURPRISED"" out in front of the store... than I would've been more lenient on my review..--.maybe. so Thank YOU & Have a Wonderful Holidays!"
26,"Waited over 30 mins for a dinner for two ppl. They brought our dinner right after I said something to the waiter which makes me wonder how long it would've taken if I hadn't said anything...On a brighter note, the mango lasi was good."
27,Can I give a negative star. The wait staff in here are awful. So rude. Never coming back. First time there and won't be back ever. Wish it were different.
28,"Ordered delivery. It came quickly and was plentiful in portion size. I have been ""yelped"" (not sure if it is a real term but coining it right now); I picked this place for the great reviews but was seriously duped. The food wasn't bad but it was not good. The vindaloo sauce is tasty but the spices they use (ginger, cardamon,  cloves) are in there and fighting for dominance. I bit into two cardamom pods and a few pieces of ginger. It left really strong flavors in my mouth that conflicted throughout the whole meal. The tikka masala was pretty sweet but good. The naan is not worth it. It is not real naan with a thin and crispy from spreading the naan mixture on the side of an oven-like kitchenware. It tasted like it was made in oil and was really thick and dense--more similar to native frybread.  Overall, I don't think I will try the place again."
29,We get catering from this place at work and the food is decent.  I decided to go try it in person and there were at least 4 open tables but they just ignored us and didn't seat us.  We ended up leaving the restaurant after we saw that they seated people who came in after us.
30,"With a 20 dollar off coupon and a tip on the original amount, the bill still came out to reasonable- I shudder to think of paying full price.  The main flavor in the food was salt- the waiter told me I should order mild instead of medium if I was unfamiliar with their spicing, but the mild was... salt.   Awkward service- a woman threw down napkins on our table and walked away.  If you look under ""non reccomended reviews"" you would see many one and two star reviews."
31,"Call me culturally ignorant but the food I ordered here was no different than Indian food you'd find at a $10 AYCE Indian restaurant. Nothing partularly memorable about the food besides how bland everything was. Just a little salt and pepper  across all dishes would have easily brought this review to a three star but sadly the omission of these basic ingredients made everything bland. On top of being bland, the Chicken Tandoori I got was also very dry. I honestly don't know how you run a business selling a plate of four chicken drumsticks for $16 if you can't do it well. I would recommend the dumplings here since they are quite tasty versus everything else I had (though to be honest, the filling was on the dry side). Overall, I wouldn't come here again given the cheaper and tastier Indian options all over Telegraph area in Berkeley."
32,"Filling but definitely not exceptional noms for the price.Delicious samosas & tamarind chutney. However, the momo's came out luke-warm, at best, and weren't very memorable.  The lentil soup that comes with the entrees was piping hot but had minimal pizzazz even after adding salt & pepper. The Kukhura Chiyau Tarkari had a lot of mushrooms in it but didn't have the best cuts of chicken and the sauce was a bit bland. However, the Lamb Tarkari had a delicious sauce.Another issue was that we specifically had asked for our dishes at ""medium"" spicy and the waiter stopped us to ask, ""Well have you been here before? How spicy can you handle?"" Seeing as I hadn't asked for the ""hot"", I thought that he was signifying that their dishes generally run on the spicier side, so we bumped our dishes down to ""mild"". Then, when they came back out, they had absolutely no spice on them. Maybe it was a communication barrier, but don't talk me out of what I want to order unless you have a good reason.We did get a free dessert with the Yelp check-in, though."
33,"Bit into multiple whole cardamom pods in my Alu Cauli Ko Tarkari. Super unpleasant. For $12, it wasn't worth it."
34,"This place used to be such a great place for dining. But for the past two/three years everything had changed. Our food was SWEET - this is not a compliment, it means that every single dish had added sugar in it - Lamb Curry, Naan, Rice, Vegetarian Potato with Peas and other dishes we had. Food seemed to be watered down a bit.Additionally, the smell of 'Fresh Linen' toilet deodorant was so prevalent, even though we were sitting right by the main entrance door."
35,"This place is way overrated. I had the chili chicken and the meat was not fresh at all, totally warm like it was microwaved, the rice they serve is horrible quality, it's super dry and stale. It was first and last time here. I wonder how it has all these so called good ratings. Never coming back after I wasted $45. Smh."
36,"I do not like the ownership whatsoever.  they are stingy and rude - they often ""forget"" to bring me the complimentary soup - and even when I ask, they are hesitant - the soup is so cheap they should be using that as a way to make customers feel nice, not upset at their stinginess.  Their food is not very good, it is mostly indian food - and i've had much better curries and biryani.  They put very little meat in the meat curries (again, stinginess).  Their momos are the only thing worth going for and lately they've changed the sauce to have sesame seeds, so it is not as good.Don't bother going there...go to Mount Everest Cafe in Berkeley on Telegraph...great service and food!"
37,"I have not been in a restaurant where they serve one dish 30 mins after another! I have to let my roommate eat otherwise it was going to get cold. By the time my food arrived, he was done with his meal. Biryani was bland and there was nothing great about the veggie curry that the waiter suggested. On top of that, they charged me twice!! I will never be coming back to this establishment! I made a mistake coming here! Himalayan Flavors was where I meant to go and that place was much much better!!"
38,"I ordered the spinach and tofu curry dish (Tofu Saag) and was incredibly disappointed. They basically gave me a bowl of spinach. There was so much spinach. Too much.  The tofu was fine, but the curry was too watery. It was not what I expected. The portions (despite the abundance of spinach) were so small for such high prices.Disregarding the food, service was fine and the atmosphere was inviting."
39,"Came here last night to try it out, website seemed promising. My veggie pakoras seemed to be 90% onions and they charged me $2.95 for mongo chutney. I get the feeling this restaurant is more about saving money than anything as the portions were so small it was sad. It's really pricey, I won't be coming back. The dish I had was good but $12 for a little bowl of it is just too much. With a restaurant that does reservations, one would think they would make enough money to actually serve a good amount of food. I still can't believe they charged me for the chutney."
40,"I made the mistake of going back to this place a second time because of a Living Social deal.  Never again.  Yes, the lentil soup, mango lassi, and garlic naan were good.  But the Lamb Vindaloo was bad, it was tasteless, stringy, and totally bland.  The Shrimp Palek was also bland and tasteless.  By contrast, House of Curries is a much better deal.  Good food, well seasoned, and cheaper.  Hard for me to believe that Yelp has a 4 Star review on this."
41,"Great food. However the service was ridiculously bad. We came in and got seated right away, however, had to wait like 20 min for our order to be taken. Once we ordered, ONE MINUTE later we asked if we can change one of the entrees. The waiter first asked me which entree I wanted to change and after I showed it to him on the menu, he looked at me and said that I would have to pay for both if I wanted to do that! Really now? Never encountered such bad service. Never going there again"
42,"I bought a Groupon thinking ""wow what a great deal - $10 for $20 of food!"" That was my first mistake. The food here is not only average to below average but it is incredibly EXPENSIVE for Nepalese food in Berkeley. My friend and I went for lunch and shared two dishes and an order of naan -- and walked out of there with a $40 bill!!! The only positive thing I can say is that the fresh naan was tasty -- but not worth $4 an order. C'mon!I will never go back there. I felt totally ripped off and if I hadn't been so hungry when we arrived I would've walked straight out when I saw the prices. Very disappointing.Don't ever buy a Groupon for this restaurant and do yourself and your waller a favor by going to a less expensive restaurant with a lunch buffet."
43,"i've had so many bad experiences here it was time to write a review. this place is so inconsistent. sometimes it'll be okay and other times it'll be horrible. i will not be back due to the poor quality of my last experience. we went there with a party of 6 and every single person got sick from it. all six of us were left with crippling stomach cramps and throwing up from this food.if you go here, prepare to get sick!"
44,"This was one of the worst Indian restaurants I've eaten at in quite some time. I knew I was in trouble when they brought out a complimentary lentil soup that was cold and tasted like dirty dish water. My friend said her chicken curry dish was awful and the chicken tasted off. My lamb tikka masala was actually ok but I knew there must have been a lot of MSG in there since I was mega thirsty. The naan was ""poofy"" like bread you would find at Applebees and not flat like most indian places. I felt like I was robbed after I paid the bill. How this place has all these high ratings is a mystery."
45,"I had a groupon so I went to check this place out.  First off,  its flippen hot inside and none of the floor to ceiling windows are open.   The food was very ordinary and over priced.   Nothing had much flavor even though I asked for spicy hot.   I had to pour on the salt.  The naan was nice and fluffy.  Note to self:  pass."
46,"We've eaten here a handful of times and I would put this place squarely at middle of the list of Indian restaurants in Berkeley - decent but nothing to write home about.  Definitely better options in this area.  However...We ordered delivery via Eat24 and it was absolutely terrible.  Zero flavor in any dish and vegetables tasted like they were straight out of the freezer, papadam were clearly undercooked and completely inedible.  Might have been the worst Indian food I've had in Berkeley.  averaging out to 2 stars hoping that our last terrible experience was simply due to being takeout..."
47,"Ordered the variety momo platter with friends -- the dough was hard yet tacky on most of them, like they'd been sitting out awhile. No thanks. Our waitress was lovely, and our entrees were mostly good, though avoid the brown rice: tasted like boil-in-the-bag. My groupon was handled by a weirdly aggressive guy at the end of the meal, too, since apparently you can't have the free yelp check-in dessert in the same order (where does it say that?). Too pricey for what I got. Won't be back."
48,"I have been to Nepal when I was a child but don't remember the food and have been meaning to try this place out for a long time. Unfortunately, Just couldn't feel this place and don't understand the raving reviews.Everything was just average or below. I am not going to hold the parking hassle against this place. The ambiance was just OK. Service was just OK, the food did not come out in the right order and took a long time. The food itself...was just OK too. The quantity was small and the food was a good 30% overpriced IMHO."
49,"I got a Groupon for this place so thought we'd check it out. Honestly, I would not cart my butt through traffic again to go eat at this place. We had the tandoor mix plate, chicken momo (dumplings), and aloo matar (which is supposed to be snow peas with potato in a tomato base) with coconut naan. The first dish was the momo, which I thought were just average. I didn't see any reason I would want them again, since they were just not that special. The sauce that they came with was also on the bland side. The yellow lentil soup was the most delicious dish, and that was a surprise, because we did not order it (it came with the tandoor platter). The coconut naan, while tasty, was more like a dessert- had more leavening then I'm used to in naan, so was a bit cake-like. Delicious, but not really complimentary to what we ordered. The aloo matar was simply not what they said it was. There was not a fresh pea nor a snow pea in the entire dish; only frozen peas, which makes sense this time of year, but they need to be honest about it up front, because there is no mistaking frozen peas for snow peas. The temperature of both the matar and the rice was so low as to be a bit suspect. The tandoor plate was just okay. The chicken was good, but average. The prawns on the plate tasted overcooked, bland and frankly, not fresh. The lamb was horrific. I could not slice through it with my knife, period. When I was able to gnaw just a bit off the end of a piece, it tasted like mutton, not lamb. It was tough, extremely gamey and impossible to eat. I brought it home for my dogs, who I thought would appreciate it much more. The service was good, but a bit stiff. The dude sitting in the back checking everyone out is a bit unnerving. Also, I thought the prices were too high for the quality. Without the groupon our bill came to almost $50.00. I can get a REALLY good meal in the Bay Area for $25.00 a plate, so why would I come back?"
50,"Oh my gosh, I really wanted to like this place and was so exited to try it after all the great reviews I read and after my brother recommended this place but i was very disappointed and shocked!! it was a nice ambience but my reviews are always about the FOOD because that is what I am paying for!I love love indian food and believe me, I know my indian food! Maybe the cook was having a bad day but I just thought this this is not the best I have ever had! My family came here for my brother's graduation lunch (congrats brother for graduating from uc berkeley). there were 8 of us there! and i had no idea it was so expensive and the portions were so small. we dropped over $100 on this meal and you'll be shocked to see what was on our table.we ordered 5 entrees that were little ""this big"" -  the size of a small cereal bowl, seriously!  we asked the waitress to give us an idea of what we should order since we didnt know how big or small the portions where. so recommended 5 and that is what we went with. all and all, i'm giving this place only one star because the portions were small, the flavor was not anything specular, even the tiki masala was not the best i have had. again, only a few pieces of chicken. the curry fried rice also wasn't great, no flavor. i seriously starved all morning waiting for this place but i was so disappointed!  i didn't get any lamb because my brother said there was like 3 cubes in there. its not like we left hungry but it didnt satisfy my indian food craving and i felt like i overpaid. i have never had bad indian food but again, NOTHING SPECTACULAR HERE. if anything, i would say it is just average tasting indian food. i am also comparing this to INDIA OVEN in Sacramento, which is an all you can eat, indian food buffet, where the food is AMAZING!  the have fried naan! seriously, dont let the word buffet fool you here.   you can eat as much as you want, the food is prepared very nicely, not cheap at all and the restaurant is very nicely decorated inside. its not what you would picture a ""buffet"" to look like."
51,"I'm really surprised at the positive reviews of this restaurant. So many better places in Berkeley to choose from. I mean, sorry Ben. W., ""Utterly splendid""? and ""at a price that doesn't break the bank""? Well, maybe I had two of the worst menu items. The chicken tikka tandoori was incredibly bland and was overpriced at $18.95. The bed of veggies is was on were equally bland and undercooked. Usually on those sizzling plates that they put the tandoori on, the onions and peppers are nice and caramelized. Not in this case. The chicken was tender though. But it was just a breast on boring veggies, again for $18.95. The other dish I got was tofu saag. This isn't your typical indian saag where the spinach is finely chopped. It's whole leaves of spinach in a very bland sauce with chunks of tofu, all serve in a small bowl for $11.95. Ridiculous. Made me wish I had gone to Ajanta instead. To top it off, the service was so slow. They half cleared our samosa plates, forgot to bring us larger plates when the dishes showed up, and the staff all seemed like they just woke up from a long nap. On a positive note, the samosas were good and were only $3.50 for two. The atmosphere is nice as well."
52,"Eh, it was fine.  It was mostly Indian Food which seems a little like false adverstising.  The momos were good though."
53,"We had an absolutely horrible experience here. No one cared and we tried to get *any* waiters attention but no one made eye contact. We had to specifically ask for glasses of water, and they never refilled it. The waiter came a total of 3 times - once to get the order, once to bring the food, and once for the check. The mango lassi was bad. The milk was old and it tasted acidic. We asked for a fresh one, but they said they had it pre-mixed so they couldnt make a new one.We ordered medium spicy food, but we instead got quite spicy instead. Imagine ordering a 4 and getting an 8. Even the naan here was weird - not soft and it felt like it was made with cheese even though we ordered plain naans.In summary, dont trust yelp reviews on this place ahahahaha. We went here thinking we would get amazing indian food. But no, we got this horrible experience and not-so-great food. I'm Indian, and I know what a freaking 'mild' spiced curry tastes like. So there you have it!"
54,Short review: The Momo (potstickers) appetizers were pretty good and one of the better ones around but I miss the usual chilli-pepper sauce. I also liked the Mango Lassi which had some good sharp mango flavor that I enjoyed.The entrees of Chicken Dhau and Fish curry was highly disappointing. Anyone could tell that neither the fish nor the chicken were cooked in the sauce at all. They were merely simmered in the sauce a few minutes before serving as none of the flavors seeped in to the poultry or the fish (salmon). Both entrees were served with a serving of rice and a small bowl of lentil soup.The onion Naan was unremarkable. I have had better almost anywhere.Not going back.
55,"Yesterday I went to eat here with my husband. This review is for vegetarians. We order veggie momo for appetizer, malai kofta, rosemary naan, vegetable biryani.The lentil soup that they served was ok. Nothing great for me. My husband loved it.The veggie momo was also ok. it was kinda chewy. again nothing great.The malai kofta and vegetable biryani were spicy. we had asked for medium spice but it was way more spicier. The extra spice was not doing anything to do the dish. It felt like some chili powder had been added to the dish as an afterthought. It definitely didnt come together.The standard fare vegetable biryani was the biggest disappointment. It was a mish mash of vegetables and overcooked rice with the spices not jelling together. The rosemary naan was warm and soft and the basmati rice that came with the entree was also good.I am giving two stars because of the let down of some of the most famous dishes and also the steep prices.The service was very courteous. Will I come here again? Nahhh, me thinks not."
56,"The place was filled with people, but I have no idea why. Food was quite poor. You can usually judge a spot by the basics - the rice, simple veggie dishes, tikka masala, etc. nothin stood out, and almost all were bad."
57,"I haven't had any Indian food lately so decided to come here and try their lamb momo. I don't know if the momo is authentic Indian dish or not but I do know that it's Mongolian main dish called buuz. Anyways we went there and I liked the lamb momo. But their food portion was extremely small and expensive.My husband had asked me if we ordered samplers instead of dinner. That proves how small was the portion. It was kinda funny tho. I laughed it off.We had groupon 10$ for 20$ deal and we told the waitress, seems she's the only one who fluent in English. Her response was Oh okay, as long as if you order MORE!...? than 20$ food then it's fine? I don't know what was she talking about. My husband was confused with that response too. Anyways rice and lentil soup comes with it for free. Usually Indian restaurants charge extra for rice and lentil soup.And their tandoori chicken wasn't cooked well all the way through. My lamb masala was good but I won't really brag about it. Place was pretty full actually I was amazed how they keep it almost full in that area where every corner has a Indian and Thai cuisine next to each other and it was Monday night tho. Cons was the portion was way too small for price I paid and watered lentil and dusty walls. The lentil soup was bland cuz they added way too much water to it. Normally lentil soup is thick not watery. I know it's comes with the dinner but still I prefer quality than quantity.Place needed some wall dusting too.  Definitely won't come back."
58,"This place was just another disappointing Indian restaurant/money pit.My girlfriend and I shared the mixed tandoori rubber chew surprise, mango lassi, and some other entree thing that isn't memorable enough to remember. What I do remember is thinking how greasy and awful tasting even the rice was.Maybe this place has better food usually, but I couldn't help feeling like $40+ was a lot to spend for a completely dissatisfying meal."
59,not worth it.the naan tasted like pizza dough.the rice had zero seasoning.i'd rather eat something i actually like.
60,"We ordered food from this place via a delivery service tonight. First time having their food. Overall for the price I was not impressed. The only dish I found outstanding was the chicken nauni, described as a himalayan style makhani. Now that was better than most I've had. We ordered all our dishes ""Indian spicy"". The chicken did have a slight spice. But our vindaloo was hardly spicy. Maybe a 3 out of 10 where I would expect a 7-10. The onion naan was good; the paratha not at all how I like it.Will try another place next time!As others have noted, the portions were on the small side given the price."
61,I was excited about this place so I decided to give it a try.I ordered lamb and brown rice. the lamb was very overcooked and brown rice wasnt prepared correctly. My friend ordered chicken and after an hour we both got stomach ache.my overal observation:The service was ok.The food was not up to my standard.I dont think I'll be visiting this place!
62,"I had high hopes from all of the yelp reviews and first and foremost suggest getting a reservation if you plan on dining on a Friday night there, waited for an hour outside before we could finally be seated.  Which I took to be an even better indicator of the food, we (group of 2) were in company of many others waiting for a seat too.  The Vegetable Pakora was really inexpensive and ok, not full of flavor, but all right.We had the Chicken Tikka Masala (not a fan of this version, and I normally love Tikka Masala), Okra (really greasy and dripping in oil, plus still quite slimy), and an Egglpant dish (not a fan either) plus Naan and Roti.  The Naan I was also not a fan of but the Roti was very good, even held up very well the next day as a leftover, whereas most Naan don't.The Chai was ok, I did have a Mango Lassi that was pretty good.  I don't like to give few stars, but I had high hopes for this place and won't be returning."
63,"""food is NOT spicy enough, dumbed down curries""Generally ambiance is nice. Reviewers talk about the decor a lot, I thought it was warm and friendly but not OTT. Service was not good enough for the amount they are charging.We saw people receiving things they did not order and generally the female Nepalese women did not understand enough English to make the experience enjoyable. Once the food is delivered to your table you would think that they would come back to see if everything is ok, no one came to our table. Once we were finished with our meal, you would think that when they come to take the plates, they would ask "" how was the meal"" they did not ask anything. I could go to any one of the other places that have order at the counter and sit down and eat experiance nearby for 30% less than what we payed here.Everyone receives lentil soup with the meal. It was a nice touch and we enjoyed it. It was however not spicy enough and too bland.We ordered the butter chicken and a lamb curry. We asked both items to be spicy, however they were very, very  weak. The curries were just ok, they lacked complexity of ingredients and they were not complex enough for our palate. I would almost say that they were just slightly better than a jar of Trader Joe's curry. I don't believe the chef was in any way ""experienced"" in the art of making food taste unbelievably great. To balance the criticism of the curries, the lamb was tender and the chicken was bite size pieces. I did not have a chance to try the Tandoori dishes so I cant comment on those items. The  naan again disappointed, it almost felt like an oven baked bread.I will not visit this place again but I give a 2 star rating because it may appeal to most of the Caucasian clients. (they probably don't know how it is suppose to taste)I don't get why this place is getting anything above 3 stars?"
64,"Okay, I live part time in the Indian Himalayas and have lived in Nepal so I think I have some idea of the food of those regions. And this really isn't it.  It isn't bad food, much of it is quite tasty. But it bears about as much resemblance to food served in Nepal as a can of Campbell's potato soup does to a proper Vichyssoise. The simile doesn't really go that far. The food at Taste of the Himalayas is, in quality of ingredients, pretty upscale. It's a Gourmet Ghetto restaurant after all. It's just not very Himalayan. Maybe it was the seafood that threw me off. Excuse me but there are no prawns or salmon in the Himalayas! If I found someplace up there that purported to serve it, I'd be running the other way, knowing that it had some really strange provenance. Refrigeration is a dicey prospect pretty much everywhere in the region so you aren't going to get seafood in an edible condition.The momos weren't too bad. I've eaten momos in Nepal, North India and Tibet and these were at least kissing cousins to the real thing, though again a bit precious and gourmet. I found the sauce a bit bland compared to the katsa that's usually served with momos in India and Tibet. The naan is really good though. It's also quite expensive, especially the naan of the month which had a sprinkle of herbs on it that cost an extra $1 on top of the already hefty $2.50 for plain naan. It was tasty and the texture was nice, but really, three and a half dollars for naan with a dollop of rosemary? Which, frankly, is an herb I have never once encountered in the Himalayas!A word to the wise - if you have allergies, be careful. Even with a pretty careful explanation of a pretty simple allergy, one member of our party still ended up unable to eat the food because they had gone ahead and put unnecessary tomatoes as a garnish on a dish that was supposed to be tomato-free. So they don't really understand that allergies don't constitute a preference, but a medical condition!Service here stinks. We waited a long time for everything, had nobody check on us for an entire hour during the meal when we could have used more water, etc. That would never happen in a good restaurant in India or anywhere in Nepal!The herbs were moderately familiar as ones used in Nepal. I found it all underseasoned, bland and not particularly different than any other assembly of meat and vegetables in sauce. If you want Indian food, there are a lot of much better places in the neighborhood. If you want Himalayan food, try one of the other places that specializes in foods from Tibet and Nepal. This just isn't it. Its' Berkeley foodie food with a smattering of Nepalese or Indian herbs and spices. And priced accordingly.  My friend Prakash who runs a restaurant in Kathmandu would be appalled at the service and the lack of depth of flavor.Oh, there is a really nice mural on one of the walls. We enjoyed looking at that."
65,"When I eat Indian Food, I  need  to not eat for a solid  6 hours before I begin to endulge myself with Spicy Chicken, Samosa, Shrimp Curry and Biryani with Lentil soup to start.I came here with Elana  and we were impressed with the  art on the walls,cleanliness and presentation of the dishes . IT was not the best Indian food that I tasted because  the spicy chicken tasted like it was mirowaved and not freshly prepared like the other Indian experiences that I had. The shrimp curry was decent but it was a little watered down. The Biryani was delicious!!   I ate the entire bowl which was the majority of my meal. The Samosas was not that great either because I kept having to spit out  what appeared to be the  hardeing of the pea shell, or the skin of the green chilles. The filling was not gounded out to smooth perfection.The main server was rude too. We were trying to have a conversation after dinner and she returned to our table assuming we were ready to pay. When we told her, ""Not Yet"", she and  the other servers kept  looking at us and watching us untill we put down our  debit cards.. We felt rushed. It was very uncomfortable, and rude.If you want a cheap, convenient , dining experience and yourn for Indian food, then come to this place. If you want to enjoy your dinner at your own pace,with  fresh,spicy exotic,rich flavors that does not taste like 5 day old leftovers , then go else where.. Not here."
66,"We went here with a Groupon (or similar offer) and were hoping for a real ""taste of the Himalayas"".  Sadly, the waitstaff was clueless, as is the menu, about which dishes best live up to the name of the restaurant. We picked a couple of recommended dishes and were delivered truly awful food. It was nothing more than generic, cookie-cutter Indian food, not even as good as Trader Joe's frozen Indian selections. The service was as bad as the food. I can't believe this place packs 'em in the way they seem too. There really is no underestimating the taste of the Average American! Please avoid the sad excuse for a restaurant!!!! For something more Himalayan, try Mt. Everest on Telegraph (stick with the Nepalese dishes), or Kathmandu on Solano. This place should be forced to change it's name to ""Bad Taste of the Indian Subcontinent""."
67,We were not impressed.  Nothing special.  Basic Indian food with a smattering of Himalayan dishes.  They were skimpy with the meat too and the prices are not great.
68,"I left a tip for the Taste of the Himalayas, but I think it warrants a full review. As with other fellow Yelpers, I too purchased the Groupon deal of $10 for $20 to spend on food. Based on the 400+ reviews and an average of 4/5 star rating, I had pretty high hopes/expectations. But unfortunately, I was left disappointed in more ways than one.First off, as with every business in the Gourmet Ghetto (despite its name, it is far from ""ghetto""), parking is and will always be a challenge. We were lucky enough to find parking before it got really busy. Parking as scarce as it was may be a bit of a turn off, that alone wouldn't deter me from returning to the Gourmet Ghetto, but the lack of flavors in my entree sure did.We ordered the saffron chicken ($13.95) from the specials of the month dinner menu, which comes with a small cup of lentil soup and your choice of Basmati rice or plain naan. Since we knew we wanted the garlic naan ($3.50) instead of just a plain naan, we opted for the rice instead. - LENTIL SOUP: we started off with the soup which tasted pretty good, it was thick with lots of visible spices and had very good flavor to it. Sadly enough, this was the best part of the meal, everything else fell short...very, very short.  - BASMATI RICE: to my surprise, this is a pretty large serving of rice for just a ""side"" of rice! Adorning this heaping mound of rice were two little round Sweet Peas, a nice touch and color contrast to the otherwise stark (off) whiteness of the rice. I wasn't expecting much out of rice, but man was I disappointed with it! Not only did the rice not have any natural rice fragrance or aroma to it, it was cooked with way too much butter/ghee! It's OK to add a bit of butter to the rice to give it a subtle hint of flavor, but it's not OK for it to be cooked in so much butter it feels as if you're eating a forkful of butter instead of rice.  :(  (-1 star)- SAFFRON CHICKEN: when the chicken was brought to our table, I can't help but feel as if I've been gypped!  It was a pitiful few pieces of chicken swimming in a sea of sauce!  Yes, they did use ""premium"" chicken - chicken breast - but very little of it and the chicken had absolutely no flavor to it. AND I think it may have been just a plain old poached half breast thrown into some sauce right before it was plated and served.  It definitely was not cooked in the sauce as it had no flavor nor its beautiful color absorbed by the meat at all.  It tastes as bland as it looks and it looks as bland as it tastes!  :( On to the sauce, the sauce had good texture and color, but... (C'mon, you had to have known there was a ""but"" coming!) it lacks flavor...any flavor at all!  Indian food as I know it is known for its abundance of spices, but this is the complete polar opposite!  Based on recollection, they advertise that this dish consists of premium chicken cooked with nuts and saffron in a creamy sauce.  Creamy as the sauce may be, I didn't taste any of the nuts nor did I taste any saffron.  I'm no expert of Himalayan, Nepalese or Indian cuisine, but I have cooked with saffron and do know how saffron should taste, this was definitely not it!  Perhaps they were referring to this dish as having a saffron COLORED sauce rather than cooked WITH saffron??  I'm not too sure, but I am sure of one thing...it's NOT saffron!  I've searched high and low through their 400 plus reviews for another opinion of their saffron chicken hoping it was just an off day for them, but I couldn't find any...not one!  I just wanted to see if I was alone in my judgement for this particular dish.  :(  (-1 star for the lack of flavor of the dish and -1 star for the deceptive misuse of ""saffron"" in advertising) - GARLIC NAAN: it smelled so very good and had quite a bit of garlic chunks and parsley slathered all over it! It looks promising and my dining companion noticed how I was making googly eyes with the naan, so I got first dibs!  At first bite, I already knew what I was getting into.  LIke the rice, it was doused with way too much butter/ghee and the garlic had already lost its potency and value many moons ago.  As with another Yelp review, I too agree that the naan was overly leavened.  It was overly thick and fluffy, with a lack of better words to describe it, and didn't really serve it's purpose.  :(  (-1 star)- MANGO KULFI: It was a round hockey puck sized and shaped ""ice cream"" with a couple of almond slices on top.  It tasted quite artificial and didn't have much mango flavoring, if at all.  If asked how I would sum up this meal? I'm quite sorry I came.  A bit harsh?  Probably, but there isn't a way to sugar coat this experience.  I'm just glad I didn't have to pay full price for this experience because I don't think I would have!  It doesn't help that all through dinner, my glutes was screaming for me to get up and walk around because the seat cushions were so worn from what seemed like a decade plus of use, it no longer had any give to it at all!  :("
69,"The Himalayas don't really taste like much.Our meals were really flavorless and the servers had some sort of perma-scowls.A friend and I went for lunch recently; she had a Groupon. I ordered a vegetable curry; she ordered a vegetarian tikka masala. We both ordered them medium. I had a bite of hers and thought it to be bland.Mine was some sort of over/under-cooked pablum with absolutely no flavor. I'm pretty certain that baby food is spicier than that. (The potatoes in my curry were overcooked, the zucchini was undercooked. They served it with a side of eggplant, of which some pieces were over- and some were under-cooked.)One star. Plus one star for the fact that (after I went up to the stand--neither of the dining room staff even remotely stopped by to see how the meal was) they re-spiced my vegetable curry (and when I got it back, it was a spicy-ish medium.) The re-spicing didn't remedy the horrible consistency of it all."
70,Food: mediocre at bestWell at least the entrees anyway. BLANDSVILLE. The garlic naan was delicious as were the samosas but i dnt know how you can really mess those up..
71,I went here because of a yelp deal. I hadn't been here in a long time because I didn't think it was very exciting the first time I went. Same.
72,"Came here on a Satruday night.  We went inside and told the host that we had a party of 2.  We went outside to wait for about 15 minutes when the host told us to come in and he said he had a table for us that would soon be ready.  We see them clearing a 4-seat table, and after finishing, we expected to be seated (no other tables were ready).  Thinking that we would be seated soon, we waited another 10 minutes when another group enters the restaurant  that didn't have reservations and they get seated at that table ahead of us.  The host said nothing to us so we left.Very poor service.  We didn't mind them using the 4-seat table for a larger group, but there was no communication from the host and he shouldn't have told us to enter if he wasn't going to seat us.  We're not coming back..."
73,"Another mixed feelings review... I loved the daal tadka to start!  Pleasantly delicious surprise!  The lamb mushroom curry was tasty and lamb was very fresh!  But there was at most four bite size cubes of lamb in the whole bowl.  For 13.95 I definitely expect more.  The chicken tikka masala was also very delicious, but also very small serving size... The onion naan, I will pass on.  There were red onion pieces throughout but the flavor didn't penetrate the naan itself... So it was like sprinkling onions on plain naan... It's ok... PassThe Palak paneer was our favorite.  Had the best flavored Palak we've had from other joints.  But as with the other dishes, The portions were lacking... Maybe four cubes of cheese.... And it sported the highest price for veggie curry I've ever paid for the amount... 11.95... Again, for that I expect a decent portion.Momos, first time I ever experienced these... They were great!  The only item we ordered that I feel actually came out proportional to price!  Or maybe I am just seeing it that way since I have never ordered them before so have nothing to compare to  To top all of this off, they took forever to refill our waters AND even at the end of our meal we still had the empty soup bowls at our already over crowded table which we had finished looooooong before dinner even came out. Gross...And one more expectation they didn't meet... No complimentary papadums... With as high as the prices are, I do admit I expect at least that.I enjoyed the flavors of the meal but the portions/size ratio will not allow me to return."
74,"Apparently the Himalayas taste bland.I ordered a mild Himalaya biryani and, despite the long list of ingredients, it barely tasted like the rice it was cooked with. The shrimp and chicken in the dish tasted as though they had been boiled free of all flavor. I normally love taking leftovers from a place like this, but tonight I walked out with half of my dish unfinished."
75,"A taste of this place is all I'll ever need.  Overall, the higher price didn't justify the quality of the food.  With the Biryani House just a few blocks down, I'll probably be returning there for my fresh naan and tikka missala. Service was less than mediocre.  Orders:-Lentil Soup and Naan (complementary with entrees) Naan was super buttery, and all things buttery taste great!  Fluffy and fresh, so they got most of their stars from that alone.  Lentil soup had enough salt to raise my blood pressure to hypertensive levels.  I'm not sure if they scoop this stuff from one big boiling pot, or whether you can request this sin sal....-LAMB TIKA MISALA: perhaps the extra few bucks I paid were for the extra spices?  A little less tomato-saucey tasting.  Cubes of lamb were few, but that's no surprise.  Meat was nice and tender, just the way I like it.  $14- SHRIMP KORMAJumbo shrimps are cooked in tomatoes and onion based korma (creamy)sauce sautéed with ginger, garlic and herbsEgh, this was OK.  More like a watery mess of orange stuff with 3 pieces of shrimp thrown in.  Not worth $14..- KERAU PANEERGreen peas are cooked in gravy of onion and tomatoes along with herbs and spices with homemade cheese cubes Kinda good, but different.  Tasty.  I can't really do justice to this dish.  Although portions are small, I was stuffed with Naan (heavy stuff if you're not much of a bread eater!).   I came here with the BF, and if you're not starving, I would just recommend getting two entrees instead of three, and order appetizers and desserts instead."
76,"This place has a lot of hype surrounding it, so finally my Indian-ness had to really see how good this place is. Yes yes, this is a 'Nepali' place but I've had my share of Nepali food. But damn does this place not live up at ALL.You walk in and its ladened with Buddha's and Tibetan Buddhist artwork, and its right below the 'zen-like' yoga center (which means when you're eating you hear the SLAMS of people hitting their feet against the floor...) Yea this place seems a little too much Berkeley trying to be foreign and 'ethnic,' and it ends up being kitschy.Well move on to the food:They serve the Dal (Lentil soup)....as a soup, which confused me because I wanted to save it for my rice. By the time the food came (which takes quite a while, but fancifully served in copper bowls) the portions were small and the dal was too cold to even use (server never answered my request to re-heat it).  I ordered:Lamb Tarkari: the lamb was tasty, but a little overcooked leaving it quite rubbery. The curry was not very flavorful at all, and had very few flavors that exuded 'Nepali' or Indian.Vegetable Korma: this is the 'you-can't-fuck-up' dish of vegetable curries, and yet it just seemed a little bland and nothing special.Overall, this place doesn't really have anything above the crap Indian places made for college students around UC Berkeley. Its overpriced, and the flavors are really nothing that compares to real Indian food. I am very critical of Indian/South Asian food being Indian myself, but if you really want the bourgeois style Indian food, check out Mint Leaf a block or two down, which adds a western touch to very authentic Indian flavors (and doesn't try to be super ""Indian"")Don't waste your time here...although you may like it if you're a 'ethnically-minded' Berkeleyan (read White)..."
77,"I had a friend come into town who was wanting to try Naplese food.  I naturally went onto yelp to see what fellow yelpers recommended.  This place was pretty empty for Saturday lunch, but it did mean that we got great service.  Our waters were never empty for very long and food came out promptly.  The beautiful walls had wonderful murals.We ordered the lamb with spinach, chicken tikka masala, and some eggplant dish.  The dishes were alright, on the lighter side of what I used to for indian food.  The garlic and regular naan were okay and the mango lassi was pretty good.The one thing that really irked me was that a man came from the kitchen with gloves on that were torn at some places, proceeded to walk to the bathroom and open the door with those gloves, and come back out a few minutes later with no sign of changing or removal of those gloves to wash his hands.  Gross!!!  I don't know it was a good or bad thing that I had already finished my meal."
78,"The best part of this meal was my company. Close second was my diet coke. Our samosas were served in a puddle of oil. The insides were still frozen.  Frozen.  I'm not sure how that is acceptable. The food was mediocre. Decent sauce but the meat -- lamb and chicken -- both disappointing and dry. The naan was ok but really inconsistent. Areas of burnt crispyness and areas of all dough. YukWorst part was the $40 bill, I don't mind spending money on quality food, but I don't know how they can justify that kind of bill for such terrible food. The service was ok, even though we felt rushed out. Will never return."
79,"My expectations were much higher coming in after seeing such great reviews. The place is completely packed on a Friday evening! Luckily I came in at the right time and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table to be cleared and be seated. For three of us we ordered: momo for appetizer, the rack of lamb, chicken curry and salmon tandori, and two orders of naan. Nothing really stood out to me and the flavors were mild and blended together a little bit too well. As we were nearing the end of our meal, I felt like we were being rushed out since there were other's standing close by to our table."
80,"Tasteless!I'd give ""Taste"" 3-stars for looks. It's a pretty restaurant, it's location is convenient, there is parking available on the street . . . I enjoyed the comp soup and the Veg Momo, the garlic nan was GREAT, but where's the spice? The Vindaloo tasted like ketchup and the Masala didn't have any flavor at all. Sorry, but I won't be back :("
81,"The food, which was actually pretty good, was overshadowed by the complete lack of any kind of ambiance that would allow one to enjoy a meal. When my boyfriend and I went here for dinner at around 7pm, there were people setting up for some kind of karaoke event on the main floor. Every few bites or so we'd hear, ""HELLO? HELLO?"" followed by screeching on the loudspeakers. This continued for the entire duration of our dinner, making it very difficult to appreciate our food. Maybe upon a return we would find a better experience, but I'm doubtful that we'd ever want to go back."
82,"I bought a restaurant.com voucher after calling the restaurant to find out if they would accept it for take out. They said yes on the phone. The restaurant.com website does not say ""dine in only"" but I wanted to confirm.When I got to the restaurant, they did not want to accept the voucher for take-out. After arguing, they agreed to accept but still added 18% gratuity even though it was take-out.I understand that gratuity policy was on the voucher but just not a good customer experience. The automatic gratuity is meant to keep people from skimping on the tip... not for charging gratuity on takeout orders.  Maybe they intended the voucher to be dine in only, but they didn't make that clear until I had arrived to pay.The food is overpriced for the quantity (especially things like naan and amount of meat in the meat dishes).  Quality is average.  3-stars normally; 2 stars because they didn't seem to care about me as the customer."
83,"Wow, really a disappointment.  We went there a few years ago and it was better then.  This time. I'm afraid, it was rather dreadful.  The nan was gooey.  And the main course was forgettable and flavorless.  Not good in the ""gourmet ghetto"".  Way better Indian food in Berkeley than that."
84,"Disaster! Went there yesterday evening. Hair in the food. Need I say more. Actually I will - took too long to get the food. Waiter spilled water on the table. No one picked up empty drink bottles, bread basket, etc.. everything was left on the table till we were done with dinner. There was no room to put all the stuff on the table. Informed owner about hair in the food - no sorry OR any kind of apology from her. Despite such an awful experience I did pay tip since the girl who was serving us has nothing to do with our terrible experience and extremely poor service and totally customer unfriendly attitude of owner."
85,Initially I have to say I don't know very much about Indian food but that being said I know good food when I eat it.  I got the Biryani and to be quite honest it was terrible.  The rice was bland.  The meat was one chunk of chicken and one of beef.  Not mixed into the rice at all.  And there were giant bits of herbs floating around in the rice.  So every once in a while I would bite into some herb and crunch crunch crunch so much herbby flavor.  Honestly it was just terrible.  Stopped eating it half way through because it was so bad.  Can't say I've ever done that before in my life.
86,"This place just is not good indian food.  The decor is very nice.  The service was good for us.  However, the food was just bland.  The restaurant appeared very clean and it seemed like they used quality ingredients.  It just felt like ""americanized"" indian food.  Not much flavor at all, and extremely pricey for what you got.  I ordered the mixed tandor plate.  It was $18.95 and advertized ""This platter consists of sampling of Tandoor Chicken, Boti Kabab (Lamb), Shrimp Tandoor, and Chicken Tikka"".  Now for $19 large I expect quite a bit.  What I got was a small sizzling plate, maybe 4"" x 8"" with two pieces of each item.  The Tandoor Chicken was unlike any Tandoor I have ever had...it wasn't the distictive red color.  It didn't have much spice.  It was just lightly seasoned chicken....but nothing approaching anything with the flavor I have gotten from any other indian restaurant.  It was moist and tender enough, just lacking.  The lamb was a little tough...definitly had to use a knive to cut it into smaller pieces so I wouldn't have a hunk of chewy meat in my mouth.  The flavor was ok, again on the bland side.  The Shrimp also could've had more flavor, was slightly overcooked, and really two pieces of shrimp on a $19 plate.  The Chicken Tikka was better than the Tandoor, only because it was darker meat...not because I prefer darker meat...prefer the breast if done right, but the meat itself has more flavor due to the fat content and it is harder to mess it up.  It was tender and cooked well, juicy, better flavor than the other stuff...but by no means great.We also ordered the Chana Masala.  It was one of the better things we had.  $12 seems a lil outta wack for some beans in a sauce, but whatever...that mural and the carved chairs are sure nice.  The lentil soup was a nice start to the meal.  It was ok on flavor, a little bland like everything else.  It wasn't hot though, call it a pet pieve of mine but I think my food should be served hot...especially soup that starts everyone's meal.  They surely are churning though lots of the stuff so they can keep it hot and not overcook it.  It was lukewarm enough that I handed it straight from the kitchen to my 2.5 year old daughter with no hesitation.  That's not very warm soup.  The chile paratha we ordered was a major diappointment.  It was quite doughy and dense, the naan I'm sure would be a much safer bet.  The Samosa was was much better.  It was presented nicely.  The dough was fresh and crisp.  It was tasty and served with a good sauce.The Mango Lassi's were tasty, but not as cold as I would like.Other notes:  As I said our customer service was good.  We came in with our 2.5 year old and were seated promptly.  They offered a high chair for her, which we gladly accepted.  They took away the two extra water glasses.  Without asking they brought my daughter out a disposable kid cup with a lid and straw...a nice touch.  We ordered rice for her and they brought it out right away which was good because she was tired and hungry...not the good combo for a parent.  They were attentive to us throughout our meal and refilled our water regularly.  We had a restaurant.com coupon for the meal.  The meal with the included 18% tip per the coupon was $60 minus the $25 coupon for a $35 out the door total.  At $35 for the meal I had I would not come back.  I could eat a simlar amount of food at a hole in the wall indian place for the same money with no coupon...and the food would leave me completely satisfied...Now I need to make my way to the hole in the wall just to get my fix.  They do have a nice mural and carved chairs...and if you're looking for some americanized bland indian food because you can't handle the real stuff then by all means come here.  I'm sure they used quality ingredients and the restaurant was clean (bathroom was lacking).  I have had better tasting indian food though (minus the presentation) at buffet indian restaurants."
87,"Unfortunately, the food is not that tasty even though the staff are super sweet and they do the awesome service of the Karma Kitchen once a month. Maybe they need a better cook? I would love to like them..."
88,"I bought $10 coupon from restaurant.com and decided to give it a try.  It's 11:30 AM Monday morning, the restaurant just opened and no one there.  I sat next to the window and felt good about the astmorphere but kind of very disappointed because the staff not even said Hi to me.  Maybe she saw me come in with my coupon on the hand and totally not greeting or show any smile.  I decided order the chicken dumpling ($8.95) and Lamb Tarkari (lamb and rice) $13.95.  She asked me for the spiciness, I said mild.  Then she asked me ""that's it?""  Hello, I'm a lady and be there by myself, how could I eat more than that?  After a thought, I added Roti dish ($3.50) just to try out.The restaurant was empty but the food came out slow.  For 8 pieces of chicken dumpling that costs $8.95, I think it's expensive because usally in any chinese restaurant, only around 50 cent each.  The roti basically are 2 pieces of flour bread (look like 2 small flour torilla) with a small yogurt dip.  I think it's too expensive for $3.50.  The lamb tarkari was too spicy so I couldn't taste it.  I ended up to go the lamb rice and for $13.95 of that dish, I got about 1 bowl of rice cooked with herbs and just a few pieces of lamb.Overall, I ate alone and the bill came out was $33 (already included 18% tips) for 3 dishes above, after minus $10 coupon, I paid $23 for a lunch in a regular restaurant with a bad service and ok food.  Should I come back for it?  Maybe not in this time of economy. My husband and I eat out a lot everyweek and we only paid around $35 for 2 at lunch or $55-$60 for dinner in most of chinese, vietnamese, korean, japanese, american.. restaurants in Bay Area.  You guys should check out Udupi, also Indian restaurant nearby in the neighborhood, much better food and  much cheaper price."
89,"The food tastes good, but I've had India food that taste just as good or better.  However, the food is A RIP OFF! The portions are TINY! $15 for an entree that came in a little metal bucket that was as tall as the pepper shaker?  On top of that, the serving size was deceiving cuz the bucket was hollowed out and the actual food was only about half the bucket.  My dish was supposed to be a special lamb/prawn combo dish, and I only got 1 prawn!  If it weren't for my Groupon, I would've been insulted/pissed off by the amount of food we got for what we paid.  They do give you a good amount of naan and rice, but why pay so much for bread/rice?I'd only come back (based on the fact that the food tastes decent) if the dishes were reasonably priced against what you actually get."
90,"The, uhhh, naan was good? Small mediocre portions of overcooked vegetables is what I recall. Plus, one dinner here equals 3-4 dinners at Vik's...hmmmm..."
91,overly priced. the only good thing they serve is naan. Everything else is normal.
92,"Terrible, over priced Indian food, many other better options around town. Does not feel good in the stomach.... The curries and mango lassis are watery and the naan is sub par. I hang out with a bunch of south asians and we know good food. This is not it."
93,"I went here for the lunch buffet and was not impressed. I can't comment on the service, because there was almost none needed with the buffet, but the food was seriously lacking. The number of dishes in the buffet was average, maybe 8 or 10 total, with 2 or 3 meat dishes offered, but everyhing looked and tasted watery and bland. The sauces were so watery that they soaked right into the rice and didn't contribute to the flavor, so I was left with watery rice and bland vegetables. The naan, rice and kheer dessert were average. I would not recommend this place for lunch.We went to this place because someone had gone here for dinner and enjoyed it, so if I decide to try it again and go for dinner, I may have to revise my rating, but for now, 2 stars for the buffet."
94,"My partner and I decided to try this place out on a Friday at 6:30.  The place was half full with at least five tables free yet we were told that we would have to wait for a table to open up by a grumpy woman, it was a bit absurd.  We watched her pace the restaurant with a frown on her face and if it would have been up to me we would have left right then.  Luckily when we were sat we had a really nice waitress.  We ordered Samosas, Mismas Tarkari, Saag Tofu, and Paratha.  The Samosas were okay, the only thing that I didn't like about them was the whole cardamom and whole cloves throughout which I just am not fond of.   The lentil soup that came next was pleasant with a nice toasted cumin flavor, I could eat this all the time.  Now to the entrees, ick!  The Mismas Tarkari or curried seasonal veggies was bland and the veggies were crunchy not anything I would have expected or wanted.  The worst though was the Saag Tofu which really had absolutely no flavor and tasted like boiled whole spinach leaves in a flavorless oily tomato sauce with big pieces unflavored bland plain tofu (and I love tofu!).  The Paratha was okay and seemed fresh but again bland bland bland.  I was actually salting my food which NEVER do!  Now as if having a crappy bland dinner wasn't bad enough, the prices are ridiculous!  $11 for a small bowl just rubbed me the wrong way.  There are so many delicious places that are so much cheaper, I just don't get it."
95,"Again I often rate a place by value, and I didn't find that here.  The food was  a little pricey for the east bay and had no ""wow"" factor what so ever.  To boot the service was sad, at best. How many time must one ask for water when there are only 3 tables filled in the place...apparently five."
96,"Got the $11.95 mixed ""seasonal"" vegetable dish and was very disappointed. The carrots had that spongy texture from having been frozen. The green beans were likewise mushy. Some mystery veggie was so woody I had to spit out the pulp. I expect more from a restaurant in the gourmet ghetto and here in Berkeley with farmers markets 3 x a week. What a rip off!"
97,"WORST service ever! I went there with a restaurant.com voucher and the owner got really pissed off. He snatched the voucher from my hand and said ""Don't come back here again."" I was absolutely shocked. For a second I thought I should've thrown the food on his face. Really, I still can't believe why he said that to me. When I asked him why he even participated in the program, he replied that he could do whatever he wanted and that doesn't mean I should jump in to take advantage of it. This place should get negative stars for this. The food was decent, but Kabana has better food."
98,"I was really impressed by the lentil soup, which is the best I've had, so I was really excited to try the samosas, roti and Palak Paneer we ordered. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. The samosas and Palak Paneer both contained my biggest pet peeve when it comes to Indian food...the whole spices were not removed prior to service. I don't know about you, but I do not find it pleasant to bite into a whole cardamom pod or chew on whole cloves; it really overpowered the flavor of the dishes. The paneer, which is my favorite part of Indian food, was off-tasting...not as creamy as I'm accustomed to and lacking flavor to the point of resembling tofu, which I like, but did not order. I was hoping the roti would help put out the burn in my mouth from the ""mild"" Palak Paneer, but it never arrived...instead we received naan that was dry, overcooked and possibly had been sitting out for a while. The wait staff was pleasant at first, but would not stop hovering after dropping off the check. The restaurant was half-full, so there was no reason to rush us out, but the wait staff kept looking at my friend and me as though they wondered why we hadn't left; it was so uncomfortable that we did get up and leave one we paid the bill. As much as I was impressed by the lentil soup and the decor, I don't think I'd go back here."
99,Why go here when you can go to Everast Cafe on Telegraph? The food here was not nearly as good and the prices were much higher.
100,"I've only eaten here once and decided to try the lunch buffet. Everything was boring and flavorless. The spices were sorely lacking. I was the only customer in the entire restaurant! I would not recommend the buffet, and probably would NOT give it another try."
101,"Food was similar. The sauces were barely different. Tasteless, overpriced, and really just not that good in general. service was mediocre. And then to top it all off, my gf found a hair in her tikka masala. A black curly hair, and when shown to the waitress she just stared blankly. They knew who it was, so be careful when you go here. Not a good experience.  The only positive was they let us out for free because of the hair. Never going back.  a hair. so gross."
102,"Overpriced Indian food. The tandoori chicken was very dry and burned. Goat Saag was good, but the lamb meat was very tough.  Atmosphere is good, decor is nice.   restaurant.com offers discounted gift certificates which was the only reason that brought me here.    Not coming here again, Naan N Curry has much better Indian food.  Oh, Parking is horrible too."
103,"Based on the good reviews, we decided to try this local restaurant.  The staff were friendly and the decor was nice.  However, the food was very bland and served lukewarm."
104,"The food here is good but not worth the price.  You can have a better palak paneer down the street at Biryani House for less than half what they charge here, if you don't mind the lack of ambiance.  The one they do here is bland."
105,"Overrated. Nice service, bad food. Bland is the best word to describe the food here. If you have pathetic taste buds and don't like flavor, this is your place. But otherwise, don't do it, don't go here, you will be disappointed. There are better options."
106,"The blandest channa masala I've ever eaten.  The sauce for the momo nothing to brag about either.  I stupidly ordered a Yeti beer, which has the sickly sweet taste of brews that have too much alcohol content (7%)."
