0,Meh - local college place for 'make your own noodle bowl.' Nothing spectacular and minimal seating.
1,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
2,"1.5 at best. Maybe it is just what I ordered. Wasn't impressed, parts were inedible. Felt like poor materials mixed in a bowl. Easily not worth the price based on the meal. Don't get me wrong, I like hodge podge places if it can be done right. But a jack of all trades usually is a master of none. This had failed on multiple points unfortunately for me.I had ordered spinach noodles, malay sauce, tofu, and extra vegetables added. 13 dollars in total. The malay sauce was light, didn't hold with everything else. It sat down on the bottom of the bowl and mixing things didn't help because it was too light in general to stay on the ingredients. Eventually when I got down close to the bottom of the bowl, the noodles tasted okay but most of this was just noodles anyway. The balance was terrible. The veggies that are supposed to be there in addition to the extra I paid for amounted to very little overall. The tofu wasn't cooked along with everything else either. It was lightly seared, and then cut up into large strips and thrown into the bowl so it had none of the flavor of the sauce and was slightly cold. Also, however the tofu was stored prior to cooking it just tasted sour so the tofu may have been bad and it wasn't even cooked adequately enough to make it taste like anything else to cover that up. Thankfully this isn't meat, bad tofu is at least somewhat stomachable but that isn't really a consolation.Perhaps the meat dishes are better here, but really if you can't cook tofu right I doubt I'd come back to try anything else unfortunately. Hopefully this is just a rare occurrence and not the norm, but I'll certainly not return to find out."
3,"I really like the chicken dish I get at Toss. The food is great. But I recently ordered the ""king prawn"" dish, which is the most expensive, and it does not contain king prawns, they're just regular dinky shrimp. Also, there were 5 of them. $11.99 for 5 shrimp. One thing though, is that I do not eat at the restaurant when it can be avoided. When you walk in the door there is always a swarm of flies. It's disgusting. The front of the restaurant stinks like a litter box somehow. The cheap metal chairs make the most horrific, loud scraping sound as people get up and down. The self-serve water station always looks grungy."
4,"l used to go to this place regularly for lunch, but not anymore after today! I got some moldy bell pepper in my stir fried noodle, and they did not give me an explanation. See the picture yourself. I am pretty sure it is mold, not burn marks, because I already ate two pieces and it tastes really bad(sour). If you care about your own health, do not go to this place!"
5,"We were excited when we first stepped through the threshold of this establishment due its relaxing ambiance. However, that quickly changed when we were instead greeted by a rude cashier. We sat down and took a little time to look at the menu and the cashier just gave a wtf-look because we took too long. I mean, it was our first time. Anyways we expected good food because of the review on here, however the food was meh at best. The soup was bland and the vegetable was not fresh. No one at my table enjoyed their foods. Worst, after we were about to leave, the cashier even asked us to clear the bowls into their dirty dishes container without a smile on her face as if we're their staff. Overall it was a pretty bad experience. I would not recommend it."
6,"Super unimpressed by this place. You order first and then sit down. If your party doesn't split up and have one person order and one person save seats, you're standing the whole time you wait for your food to come out. I've even been stuck having the food come out without a place to sit. Not great food or great quality, but it's fine. Over run with college students."
7,I have come here a few times and have enjoyed the noodles. On 6/21/17 at around 7:20pm I ordered a noodle soup for the first time which I did not like at all. I went up to the register and asked the employee if I can switch it for the noodles I usually get. There were two employees (an Asian guy with glasses and a younger Asian girl). They said I could not switch it to another dish because I tried it already. I don't know how I was supposed to decide whether I liked my food without trying it... HORRIBLE customer service. Their management needs to really teach them how to better interact with their customers.
8,Meh. Had the noodles green curry and t'was nothing to write home.
9,"I was super excited to try out this place due to good reviews and great interior but walked in only to be greeted by a super rude cashier with a pissed off face. It was our first time here so we understandably took 10 mins to order our food but the staff shot us dirty looks, come on man!! The food came out horrible - old veggies with super dry noodles. The tom yum tasted like it was made with instant soup powder. Gross! I didn't even finish half my bowl. Worst of all, the waiter told us to bring our own plates to the back of the restaurant when we were done. We had to place it in a dirty container and she didn't even smile or thanked us. Would NEVER eat here again even if I was paid to do so! Bad food, terrible service and disgusting attitude!!!"
10,"The food came out very quick... But it was cold. I was eating it for about 10 minutes when I noticed a (medium to long) black hair. The food was a strange lukewarm temperature so I decided to stop eating it and save it for later (I pulled the hair out). I got diarrhea shortly after eating, maybe 2 hours later, in the middle of my art history class. I didn't really think anything about it. ... Until my boyfriend finished the rest of the noodles and reportedly woke up at 3 am to have diarrhea. So there was definitely a trend."
11,"Disappointed. I grew up with laksa from Singapore, Penang and Sarawak. I cooked laksa from scratch. So I know what need to go into the soup to make the bold flavorful base. Their laksa base need flavor. It's blend with not even a taste of spices. The hokkien noodle is not authentic."
12,Waited for my takeout order for 30 minutes. It was sitting there congealing on the counter for the whole time. They didn't bother to let me know. It wound up as a cold brick of noodles.
13,"I usually update my reviews for places that deserve it, but ironically I've updated my review for Toss for the opposite reason...3 years ago when I was a freshman at Cal, I fell in love with Toss. I thought it was such a cool concept that you can create your own dish. Since I loved pad Thai and Thai food I always made the peanut sauce hokkien and I never ever found it a miss. 2 years later I've found a pretty unfortunate distaste for toss. Sorry, I know everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but I'd rather be honest about why I find this place to suffer from overhype...The good:Toss is hella efficient. If I need to make the Bart to a warriors game and I only have 20 min, this place is great, even when it's busy... The soups they have are also not bad. Their Tom yum soup is plentiful and will get you full...The bad:Besides their noodle soups, everything else has gone down hill. Why? It might just be my appetite, but if I'm paying 8-10$ for food, I should be somewhat full right? That's how I felt when I first tried toss. But now whenever I get a rice dish or a noodle dish, you get a big bowl but when you stare into it, it's barely 1/3 full. I guess that's why I like their efficiency- they give you nothing...In addition, most of the items on their menu are actually just not justified by the price. I guess I'm just a bit too sophisticated with my food, but a lot of their items are not that hard to make. If you're charging 9$ please be a bit more original and/give more portions? TBH If I wanted mediocre quality food that's filling, there's Chipotle or if I want higher quality that's filling, there's urban turban... Or I can cook it.I know this is more of a rant, but it irks me when I see this place so severely overhyped. Hella college and high school students flock here. I think once you start cooking you'll realize that it's really cheap and easy to make their dishes and therefore the price is not justified.But kudos to Toss for easily ripping people off.GG,"
14,":(I got the worst food poisoning of my life from the coconut curry.  I was hunched over the toilet for two hours puking on the day before I started my sophomore year of high school.  NOT a good memory.  Whenever I walk by this place on my way to bart in the morning I feel sick.  It's such a shame too because it's right next to a movie theatre I frequent, and now I can't go without being reminded of my funky food poisoning.  It was one of those things that while I was eating it I could tell something was a little off but I thought to myself 'don't be a goof' and I kept eating.  So I suppose that's my bad.  At any rate, I do not associate fondness with the name 'Toss.'  I hope someday I can return, cleansed of my bad memories.  However, that day is not today.  Nor will it be tomorrow."
15,"Let me start off by saying this has been one of my favorite restaurants for a while.Today I went again and there was a piece of chicken in my pork order, and the chicken had BLUE MOLD ALL OVER ITWhen we complained, they just said sorry and that was it.I now have a terrifying stomach ache with sharp pain."
16,"We went to this Noodle Bar and ordered extra vegetables, they charge extra 2.50 for each dish for extra vegetables. However the extra vegetables that they put in our plates were stems and stuff that was leftover over. When we told the lady at the register we weren't happy with  the dish she gave us a free drink instead of making it right.. I spoke to the owner today and I'll he would offer with a $10 gift certificate this place is very expensive and we spend over $30 every time we go I would recommend you not go if you want good customer service. I would recommend you go to Crunch right around the corner"
17,"This place has gone from best to worst. Every time I order to go, they give me the worst possible food (happened more than 4 times now). Their noodles are cold and barely have any sauce anymore. It feels like eating boiled noodles with RAW Tofu. I remember when it used to be great. Not any more. Never going here again.Also, their broccoli was molded last time. It sucks"
18,"I ordered noodles with chicken in spicy sauce.  Lets start with what they got right:-There was chicken-There was noodles-There were vegetables...sort ofWhat did they get wrong:-10$ for about the same amount of food that a Cup O Noodle would provide me and just as mediocre.  I could actually see the bottom of the takeout box because there was so little in it.-""Lots"" of vegetables for me was piece of broccoli, 1 slice of bellpepper, and a sprinkling of green onion.  Obviously they are really loose with the word ""lots"". There is more freeze dried corn and carrot in a Cup O Noodle than there was veggies in this dish.-Gave all the Asians chopsticks right off and the white guy gets a fork...come on it goes both ways guys- There were maybe 5 thin slices of chicken in the whole thing.  I wasted 10$ that I could have used to get 10 Cup O Noodles at the store and I would have been happier despite the high blood pressure from all the salt."
19,"My co-workers and I visited this restaurant for lunch and it was OK. I had the Tomyum soup with spinach noodles.  I thought the flavor was a bit sour for tomyum.   The spinach noodles were actually good, as it was the needed carbs for the day.    The serving was not that large, so I didn't feel full or bloated in the afternoon.The odd thing about the place is that we got our own napkins, chopsticks, and spoons from the community area, not knowing that they would serve those when the bring out your dish.  The waitress who brought out our order removed the napkins, spoon, and chopsticks from our table and placed them back in the ""clean"" community table.  Ewww.   Oh, and each patron gets only 1 napkin....odd."
20,"We walked in last night and it smelled like something bad.  Wet dog is listed below, cat pee was suggested last night, but I thought it was rat pee.  We sat near the door and the smell seemed to dissipate, but wow at the end it got real strong.  Really REALLY a bad smell. The steamed vegetable dumplings were good.  The rice and tofu was pretty greasy. All in all, not a great meal."
21,"I wanted to like Toss, but it just wasn't very good.  We didn't plan on eating here, were wanted to try Great China since they re-opened a few days ago.  Stupid place had a 1hr wait, so I said Hell No.We walked back down to Shattuck Ave & said we'd try out Toss.You pick a noodle, type of sauce or soup, then if you want meat or veggie or combo.I picked Hokkien noodle w/ Laksa soup Combination $10 - soup was way too sweet, noodles meh, meats & shrimp, tofu was just ok.  Nothing really good about it.B. got thin rice noodle w/ green curry $10.  He thought it was too sweet also, he finished it, but wasn't impressed.Fried octopus $6 - B. liked them, I didn't try.Charge your meal if you want.Cucumber water you help yourself w/ small mason jars available.Separate bathrooms available - no key needed."
22,"Came here on a cold friday night around 5pm, there was prettt empty. I order the coconut soup base, and it had absolutely no favor... While my friend order the tom yum. My friends comment was, ""hmmm I can totally make this, and probably better too."" At first we were expecting something quick and cheap, however the portion was just okay, and the noodle was just tasteless. We end up going to the nearby dessert place just to get more food to fill our hunger.One star for the food, plus a star for the self-service."
23,"The bowls look big, but the portions are actually small for the price paid. The thick noodles are pretty good, but sometimes they over-do the sauce. But I guess the location is convenient for a quick bite."
24,I wouldn't eat here again. Noodle portions for dine in were super small and food was average at best. I had the hokkien noodles with Japanese sauce and chicken. Also what's up with all the flies in here?
25,"I was in Berkeley again recently and decided to give Toss another shot, just because of the great reviews its had from Julie Z.This time, I ordered thin noodles in laksa sauce and was once agani totally underwhelmed. Given I am actually from Singapore, the laksa soup was totally lackluster, underseasoned and tasted more like Thai coconut curry than laksa sauce. The only positive thing I can say is that the service was very friendly.BUT I can't believe they're charging $10 for a bowl of watery not flavorful soup with fishy tasting tofu. :/DISAPPOINT."
26,"To be honest I'm not sure what the hype is about. The food is rather mediocre. I've tried the Hokkien noodles both Thai style and in Laksa. The Thai style noodles were okay but not nothing to write home about. The Laksa was extremely bland and I had to add a lot of the extra sauces they provide for it to be decent. The noodles themselves are pretty good but they don't seem to absorb the flavor of the sauce much and the vegetables just seem like an afterthought--they're somewhat random choices in my opinion (at least to me, carrot doesn't seem very fitting with laksa) and they were very bland since they didn't really absorb the flavor much. Maybe I'll give it another try but so far I've been disappointed. Portions are decent for the price and I like the idea of mix and matching noodles and sauces--if the taste could be improved and maybe if they gave suggestions for combinations, I think they could improve a lot."
27,"I used to love this place. But now foods come out either extremely salty or burnt. For last 3 visits I had to request adjustments on the food, which comes out very washed flavor and not so fresh."
28,"Positive: sauce isn't too heavy, different options and types of noodles, design your own noodle, easy to order, plenty of seats. Negative: not that tasty, high sodium content, there were a lot of flies in the restaurant, meh. I don't think I would come back here again."
29,"2 stars for the cute ambiance and quickness of service... but sorry I've had better. Another star deduction for not having spinach noodles. MEH. To be honest for $9 I'm better off going to the DIY mongolian bbq spot at the mall. Now this place is not at the top of my list, but let me tell you it's way way way tastier than what I experienced last night. I only bring this place up because I believe it to also be categorized as a fellow noodle spot. The laksa tasted like straight up water and I don't know why I didn't go with my gut instinct and listen to other reviewers complain about it being watered down. I tried to like this place I really did, but spoonful after spoonful trying to decide if it tasted watery it was in fact.......watery. (As ghetto as this sounds) Instead of complaining, I waited for my friend to finish eating, took their leftover japanese sauce and threw all my noodles into their bowl and tried to enjoy the rest of my sad ass dinner. I'm filipino and I'm not a picky person when it comes to asian food, I won't even complain about greasy chow mein or noodles from panda express, but this place needs to step it up. Unfortunately I don't think ill be back to give them more of my money nor a second chance.."
30,"I want to rate this place 1.5 but I will be nice and give it a 2. 1 is a little harsh.At first you come into this place thinking that all these items are pretty well priced for what it seems you will be getting. But as we received our food, I thought I had seen each of these items in the bulk packaging area in korean/chinese markets. It LITERALLY looked like they bought the items from those shelves and gave you skimp amounts for way more than the price, with a little paprika or garnish on top to make you think you're getting a special treat.The food tasted exactly like what I thought when I first received it. The tofu/wakame actually tasted like the korean market, but a little more bland. And the veggie dumplings.. STRAIGHT OUT OF THE FREEZER. I mean I understand this is close to college town and people need to be cheap to survive and thrive but don't trick people into getting food that required 0 effort ALONG with the fact that you chose the cheaper veggie dumplings on the shelf, not the better grade ones. At least get them from costco if you're trying to save money.The main entrees were not much better, although my girlfriends tasted much better than mine. I got the green curry with chicken. Watery, straight out of packaging flavor. Enough said.My girlfriend got the spicy flavor something with brown rice. It tasted good, but again, it tasted like I just took 3 random things out of my fridge, heat them up and put them on a plate.Please. upgrade your ingredients. Don't serve your customers the low quality food that requires no effort. Or at least if you do, make sure they won't be able to tell by look or taste. Then you're good."
31,"I'm sorry, but Toss did not hit the spot. The spot has nice decor, but when you walk in, there was somewhat of a stale water smell...I'm pretty sensitive to smells. But, you get used to it pretty quickly. Got a wok toss with the thai sauce and also the fried octopus appetizer. I liked the fried octopus, but it does come in quite a small portion, with just 8 pieces. However, the sauce that it comes with is good, and the octopus tasted quite fresh. The noodle dish was all right and came in a large portion, but by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl, there was a lot of oil, and there weren't enough vegetables to noodle content for the dish. Also, I think at the end of the day, I would prefer a pad kee mao or pad thai or something. Maybe the chef specials are better? Or maybe I'm not the best at choosing combinations. My friend got a broth based one, and she liked how it was much lighter than my wok fried dish...but I wasn't a huge fan of the flavors of the tom yum soup either. The thai iced tea is nice and thick, delicious. However, I will give them a major props for being really nice people, as my friend left her invisalign wrapped up in a napkin at the table, and when we went back, they were really nice about giving us gloves to dig through the trash, and accommodating with our disrupting their kitchen to hunt for it...even though we didn't find it in the end."
32,"Recently had one of the worst dining experiences of my life here with my friends.  We all ordered our usual spinach noodles with pork and peanut sauce and waited for our food.  After a long wait (we hadn't even received our drinks) we finally got our food.  We looked down and noticed none of our noodles had sauce.  We told the waiter and he told us to just put chili flakes on it, which makes NO sense.  But before we could say anything he walked away.  We then asked another waitress who then consulted the original waiter, he came over and scolded us saying that he already told us to just add chili flakes.  Finally, one of the chefs walked out, we got his attention and asked for peanut sauce.  He noticed how dry our noodles were and rushed out with some sauce (the only reason I'm not giving this place a one star review).  After finally getting to eat the noodles we noticed they were really undercooked.  However, after everything we went through just to get the sauce we decided to forego complaining.  It was then in a final chain of bad service that we noticed we never got our Thai iced teas.  We got the attention of our waiter who then made us show our receipts to ""prove"" that we ordered them.  He then went into the back and returned with three iced teas that were mostly just milk and SLAMMED them on the table in front of us.  It was then that he went to the other waitress and obviously talked crap about me and my friends (they were even pointing).Toss used to be one of my favorite places but I will NEVER be back."
33,"I ordered fried rice for take out and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. It took 25-30! And then when I opened the food at home, it wasn't even fried rice! It was flat rice noodles! Everything else was right, though. And it was fine. But wrong. My prior experiences here kept me from bumping this down to one star."
34,The tomyum did not taste like tomyum. The mix and match idea seems more like a gimmick than a solid way to produce good dishes.
35,The food was okay.  Can't say I would be in a rush to go back anytime soon.  The place smelled like wet dog and urine.
36,"It started off great at Toss. The ambience was casual but still modern. The menu was easy to read and there wasn't TOO much on the menu. I did have a hard time deciding what I wanted but that was because there were so many combinations you could put together. You first start by choosing your noodles, then broth, and finally the meats/veggies. I decided to go with the Hokkien noodles, which are a little thicker than ramen noodles, with the thai stir fry along with the combination (included all the meats and veggies). My cousins and I also ordered 2 chicken skewers with peanut sauce on it and 1 pork skewers.The noodles came out first and it was AMAZING! There was a ton of flavors packed into those noodles and the meats were cooked perfectly. The little bits of egg in the stir fry made it even more pleasing! I also ordered the thai tea, which is a must!The reason why I rated it two stars was because of the chicken skewers. Half way into the chicken, I noticed a pink liquid coming out and upon further inspection I noticed that the middle of the chicken was pink and concluded that the chicken was raw. After telling the waitress this she said ""is it too raw for you?"" What kind of question is that?! Raw chicken is RAW CHICKEN. If you don't cook the chicken through you can get someone very sick. She did get me new skewers but by then my appetite was lost. Just stick to the noodles here and avoid the chicken skewers."
37,"I had Japanese sauce and flat noodle for lunch. After I ate some, I started feeling nauseous and funny in my stomach. I had to go to the bathroom due to the immediate diarrhea. I felt nauseous all the afternoon. Will never go there again."
38,"Meh- nothing to write home about.  Food was just ok, but not great.  Nice service from behind the counter. This place is pretty new and they did a good job with the dining room, but I think it is a mistake when a restaurant fails to consider that the bathroom is part of the customer's experience.  It was stinky and dingy- the door was covered in kick marks and grime- obviously remnants from the previous tenants, but yuck."
39,I always suspected that take out portion sizes are barely 2/3 of that of dine in orders. Just compared my take out order with my friend's dine in order to confirm and I was right.
40,"This was one of my favorite places. I came here at least 8 times over my undergraduate career and always enjoyed the food. The idea of customized noodles is really cool, and the hokkien noodles either Chinese or Japanese style were always really good.However, I came here on a recent visit to Berkeley (after ~8 months of being away) and got my usual lunch. An hour later, I started to feel nauseous and sick, and was even getting chills despite it being a warm 70 degree day. I was sick for about a 6 hour stretch, and even considered calling the doctor since I had never,in my life felt this way after eating. I'm not sure exactly what it was, and I'm all better now, but I am virtually certain that it was related to the food. I spoke to a close friend with whom I was staying, and he told me that he also felt sick after having Toss. So, even though it had never happened to me before, I'm not sure it was a coincidence, and I can no longer recommend this place."
41,"Edit:So the smell was less prominent this time. But it was still there. I endured it and had some noodle veggie thingy, and it was alright. Not spectacular though, I probably won't be coming back again because there are so many better places to eat in Berkeley!---------The two times I've walked in here it smelled like someone puked or had diarrhea and they had just cleaned up but the smell was too strong for them to completely cover up with fabreeze and disinfectant. I couldn't stand it and had to leave the restaurant. But my friend got take out once, I tried the food, and it tasted quite good.Super unfortunate that the place smells so bad! Not sure if this is a constant thing. I'm going here later tonight with some friends and hopefully the smell won't bother me. Or perhaps the smell won't be there?  Let's hope so, for my nose's sake."
42,"I loved it here the first time, but the second time totally missed. So I have to give it two stars...a place can't be hit or miss like this.I came with my family the first time around September and we tried 5 different combinations of noodles and sauces. Obviously some were better than others, but it was an overall yummy experience and everyone loved it. I just wish I remembered what we actually got...so I would have known for the second time what to pick and what to avoid.For my second time, I took my friend here a couple of days ago and I was not impressed. I got the spinach noodles with chicken and Laksa soup and it was basically really watered down curry. I had to put so much salt and it was still not enough. I just gave up. Even tried putting some chili sauce to make it tastier but nope there was just too much soup so it didn't work. Man was I super bummed...maybe you need to actually get CURRY as the sauce instead of this coconut curry soup to get the taste. But it shouldn't be so tasteless either...My friend got Hokkien noodles with beef and Japanese (sweet&sour) sauce and it was pretty good! He wasn't full though because it was dry noodles, not soup, so he got another order. His second order was Hokkien noodles with combination and Malay (peanut) sauce...and it was SO salty. I was thinking ""okay where was the salt in mine earlier, guys."" But anyway, he didn't end up finishing it because it was just way way too salty at the bottom. Super conflicted about this place....I guess you just have to find the right combos. But it's unpredictable. and the fact that the salt amount varies so much just confuses me."
43,"Minus stars if possible. Horrible food and horrible service. Tried to change my order (type of noodle) RIGHT AFTER I ordered -- like right after saying the noodle type and when I was still standing at the cashier, but the cashier kept on talking on the phone and would not listen -- yes she was talking on the phone while taking our order. I was very nice and patient and finally got my message across, but a few minutes later they threw the bowl at me and said in some broken English I could not understand. They refused to make me the right one. My boyfriend was so nice that he paid for THEIR mistake and order me a new one. It is important to note here that asked to change the noodle early enough so they could take action before the food was being prepared. Also it's not a super busy restaurant with lots going on, or a complicated type of food, so I do not think it takes all that much rocket science to change the noodle type -- especially LESS THAN ONE SECOND after the order. Not even worth mentioning they never said sorry when I was clearly upset, because THROWING the food and WALKING AWAY just says it all about how they handle business and how they see customers. Seriously, such a bad experience. Normally in America if you work at a restaurant and take the wrong order by your own mistake then you just assume the loss yourself and get the customer a new one rather than act like nothing happened, throw the food and walk away. Anyway you made extra $9 tonight so good for you."
44,"I ordered the Chefs special, garlic chicken for $11 and got a small amount of veggies and chicken and a huge pile of noodles on the side that tasted pretty rubbery. I would have preferred more veggies and chicken for the amount spent."
45,Incredibly rude. Refused to remake my order after there was a mix up over the phone. Then they proceeded to tell me that they would no longer serve me and they would like me to leave. I would've given them no stars if my app would've let me.
46,"This place has a step-by-step menu to customize your dish. It's things you would expect like, rice or noodle? Brown rice or white rice? Flat rice noodle, thin rice noodle, egg noodle, flour noodle, or other noodle? After picking the base, you pick the style. Soup or stir fry? What soup? Tom yum, laksa, or ambiguous clear broth soup? What stir fry sauce? Japanese, Thai, Malay, Chinese sauce? Apparently, Chinese sauce is soy sauce. Japanese sauce is sweet and sour. Thai sauce is spicy. Malay is peanut. It's all very ambiguous. And of all the Asian cuisines that this place embodies, it does not represent Vietnamese really. If you want Thai curry, there is red and green, but no yellow. I had the laksa with hokkein noodle and beef. Now that was delicious. Everything else I tried was subpar. I had thin rice noodle in the tom yum and pork, but the noodle was not cooked enough. Some were only clear around the edges. The cuts of pork were not good quality. The stir fry noodle with Chinese sauce was so-so. Unlike the thin rice noodle in the soup, the flat rice noodle was mushy. Also, I found hair in my dish. Once, the server also brought me the wrong order and demanded to see my receipt, which could've easily said something aside from what I was trying to order if it was taken down wrong at the counter in the first place. Even though I've been a couple times now, I am not won over by Toss Noodle Bar."
47,"I get it...people like to customize.But really, sometimes I'd rather restaurants just decide for me and do it right! Imagine yogurtland: you get the key lime pie flavor and in this alternate universe they force you to get 5 toppings. EXCEPT surprise surprise...you're blindfolded. So you end up with key lime pie + m&ms + mochi + mandarin orange + caramel sauce + coconut shavings. Kind of gross.That's Toss for you!!! Even if the ingredients separately are awesome, after you're done ordering you're really just stuck with a hodge podge of random stuff that may or may not taste good together. It's seriously a lottery. If you insist on going anyway, the Chinese fried brown rice is probably the best dish here. It's just soy sauce fried rice + meat of your choice, but it has that yummy wok fried taste that is hard to find."
48,"I came here when this place used to be a mediocre Thai restaurant and was immediately impressed by how bland and inauthentic the food was and how dedicated they are to skimping on the proteins while charging you a little more than the competition. If you were a fan of the restaurant during those times, you'll be happy to hear that the only thing that has changed about the restaurant is the name. For the price you pay, the portion of carbohydrates you get is HUGE, which overcompensates for the lack of flavor, authenticity, meat, and actual substance you get. If you're a true fan of noodles, Thai food, or Asian fusion, look elsewhere. You can tell from the mason jar cups and high prices that this place is all style and no substance."
49,"You know who likes food in this area? COLLEGE KIDS.You know who has no taste in food? COLLEGE KIDS.DO NOT trust the college kids, they will lead you astray every. single. time.Sure, you can create 500 different noodle dishes from their options, and every single one of them will be a noodle mush bowl. No flavor besides salt and mild teriyaki? It's like noodles meets Taco Bell. And honestly, I have nothing else to say because that's how memorable it was.2 stars for decor. That's it."
50,"I was excited to come here after hearing the hype around it and glancing in at the simple, appealing decor. I ordered the vegetarian style Clear broth with tofu and rice noodles, my boyfriend chose tomyum with rice noodles and chicken. Unfortunately, it seemed as if ""Clear"" really means hot water with a dash of salt. The tofu seemed to have been just thrown into the bowl unspiced and crying for love, the noodles followed the broth's idea of what flavor it should be- which is no flavor at all, and the vegetables were making the dish seem more substantial, pushing hard that you may be gaining some nutrients, which you would only lose in trying to chew the hardly cooked green tubes. My boyfriend's tomyum was also tanged with disappointment and buyer's remorse. We left with a space for hunger still echoing in our stomachs and the letdown over the dinner that could have been flavor and atmospheric perfection. But hey, if you're trying to lighten the load in your pocket or purse, they'll be happy to take $20 dollars off you in exchange for water and water and a liiiiiittle bit of salt."
51,"We came here around 6pm on a Saturday and it was packed with what looked like students. I'm not sure why though- I guess it's good for groups because there are a lot of mix and match options.  Pick your carb, your protein, and your sauce. The food was just ok- I liked my Hokkien noodles but the Tom yum wasn't that good and there wasn't much beef.  Finally, I don't usually care about service but the man taking our order was downright rude.  It put a bad taste in my mouth before I even tasted anything."
52,"This place is not worth four stars in my opinion. More like two. The quality of food is so bad that I left my bowl unfinished with over half of noodles available.Quality of Food (1/5): I ordered the thin rice noodle with chicken in Laksa soup. First of all, a legitimate Laksa has a creamy, slightly oily taste with a spicy kick. All i can taste from this Laksa is coconut milk with some color flavoring to make it look like the color of the Laksa. The taste is bland and very heavy. They should not bring down the name of Laksa and just call it yellow curry instead. The thin rice noodle is not fully cooked so the texture is hard. The vegetables were not fully cooked so it was crunchy. Everything in that bowl was just off. I even tried my friend's green curry - it's also bland with a lot of coconut milk. The tom yum soup that my other friend ordered was a load of MSG and it felt like it came out from a bag (probably it is). Quality of Service (N/A): Not a lot of service has you just order at the counter and they deliver the food to you. It's more of a self-serve type of deal. You get your own water, but they do provide chopstick and a spoon when your food comes. I can't give a score on their serviceAmbiance (3/5): Very cozy place and the decorations were pretty nice and laid out. It's nothing spectacular thought.Overall, I left the place hungry because the food was just that bad."
53,"I love noodles, I crave them all the time... I've come here a few times (I'd say 2-3) but am never impressed. Veggies and meat at a minimum, and portions are so small! I'm a little girl and don't eat much and I still leave hungry. My boyfriend would have to order 3 portions to get full. Atmosphere and decor are nice."
54,"Came with a friend for dinner and I was underwhelmed by what Toss Noodle had to offer. The menu is simple: pick a noodle, pick a sauce, pick a protein. They'll stir fry it, comes out to about ~$10. I had a hard time choosing between the peanut sauce and the Thai sauce, but in the end, it didn't really matter. Both tasted watered down, a bit bland, and tasted the same. Super disappointing. My friend and I went to dinner round two at OB Town because the portion was also a bit small. I came here originally because I wanted to avoid the line at Noodle Theory but I would take the line over the meal I had here."
55,"I want to like TOSS.  I really do.  I like the concept- pick which noodles you want, the sauce you want, the meat you want, and they whip it up.  The food itself is okay, which is why I'm giving it even 2 stars.The problem?  It's how they wash the bowls and utensils.  It REEKS of Palmolive or whatever soap they use.  It's nasty.  I want to smell food, not smell soap the whole time I'm eating.   I've been there twice- I went there today to try them again thinking it may be a fluke the 1st time I went.  But I was there today and again tasted soap.  Either they don't know how to wash the soap off properly or they just dunk everything into a wad of soap thinking that'll make it clean.I'm sorry but it smells gross.  Please wash the dishes and utensils properly.  I want to eat and smell food- NOT smell soap and chemicals."
56,Food is ok (3 of 5 stars). Ridiculous number of flies everywhere. Like clouds of them. Really unsanitary and gross.  They need to  do something about the flies (minus 2 stars).
57,Had the thick noodles with peanut sauce but could barely taste the peanuts.  The noodles were done just right but it didn't satisfy my peanut craving.
58,"1 star for undercooked chicken (and onion slices, but this is much less important).It's really not that hard to cook small shreds of chicken through. Not only was the meat pink on the inside, but it also oozed pink liquid when pressed - not acceptable at all. And anyway, since the onions were basically raw, this should have been an indication that the dish needed to be cooked longer. Since I ordered my entree to-go, I wasn't able to ask for another portion and had to toss out the entire meal.From what I tasted before I got to the chicken, Toss Noodle Bar is your usual ""drench everything with overly salty sauces"" Asian restaurant. Definitely a negative addition to the Downtown Berkeley food scene."
59,"i work at least five days a week evaluating customer service in many establishments.i had lunch here and was both favorably and very unfavorably impressed.  the thai noodles were good -- not great.  if there was supposed to be sauce with it, i didn't see any other than a bare moistening.  the real kicker came when i had finished my fairly small serving of noodles and asked if i could order simply a bowl of fried rice, which their wallboard menu indicates they make.  they ""couldn't do it.""  all they could do was make me another dish using the three steps from the menu.as somebody who works almost every day evaluating the customer service of various establishments, including a great many restaurants, ranging from expensive steak houses to burger kings, i can tell you that their willingness to please a customer by doing something they haven't already done 10,000 times before is zero.my summary: food quality - 2.5service speed:  2  slow (bring a book.  12 minutes is too long to wait for a bowl of noodles)customer service attitude: 0.  don't ask them to do anything they don't automatically do for every customer, because they don't care if they please you or not.  bad attitude.almost any local vietnamese restaurant serves noodles as good or better, and almost certainly with a greater desire to please you."
60,"Went with my wife and all seemed fine.  Ordered two dishes.  Wait, get food and start to eat.  Find a hair...  (okay, I would never crap on a spot for this mistake.  It grosses me out super bad but hey shit happens).  However, it is the way they handled the issue.  I took the dish up to the front and told the guy.  He was quick and current in asking me if I wanted it re-made or a different dish.  I ordered a different dish.  The is woman comes to the table with my soup and asks me what was wrong.  Okay, the place is packed and I am now embarrassed, but if she wants to make a scene out of the issue I am game.  I told her about the hair, and she says ""where is it""?  I said ""I wiped it on the chair"", she says ""We wear hair nets"",  Okay now I am getting angry.  First of all she is standing in front of me without a hair net on and I visually scan the place and see 5 other employees with no hair nets.  I am also now being forced to defend my decision to try and give them a second chance.  She says ""you don't want this""?  Okay thats it... now I am pissed.  Everyone in the place is looking at us.  So she gets the ""other"" me.  I raise my voice and tell her... ""bring me the fucking check"".  ""we are leaving"".  Oh, boy she is still won't stop...  once she realizes we are leaving and she knows that I will do just what I am doing now, she starts telling me she will take the dish off the check.  I refuse.  I am like a little kid when I am pissed.  I tell her to ""get me the fucking check now""!  I am standing and now have the entire place as my pulpit.  SO I announce to the entire place that I found a hair and she refuses to re-make the dish.  All in all the food was not that great.  Greedy.  Couldn't part with a 2 dollar (cost) of noodles to make a customer happy.  You done fucked up lady."
61,Yuck. The laksa was so sweet; probably a good place for students who don't know any better but would not recommend to anyone who thinks they want laksa bc this ain't it.
62,"I used to be a huge fan. I used to come here at least once a week to get my hokkien noodle fix. However, I'm a vegetarian. The last time I got take out, my noodles came with a piece of chicken. The veggies were not cooked well and was not spicy like I specified. It was the first time I threw away the togo box without finishing. Very disappointed. It was gross. Never again. It's a shame."
63,there were cockroaches in the restaurant  we need to be sure that we are eating at a clean place because as of right now i will not be eating here along with plenty of other college students till this problem is resolved
64,"Place has good ambience, but the wheat noodles were hard and there was a small amount of food. There was also too much sauce, and it was too salty. I got Thai sauce, but they accidentally gave me Chinese sauce. When I asked them about it, they just sprinkled some red peppers on the noodles.  Don't recommend."
65,"I ordered tofu curry noodles, but there were bits of chicken in the bowl as well. Ick."
66,"Imagine a college cafeteria... Now imagine that there is a noodle bar. You get to choose your own toppings and then they add a soup stock into it. That's essentially what Toss is...That being said, you can expect the same quality of food as you would find at a Mongolian Wok restaurant. For $8 per bowl, there is nothing special about this place. I mean, why pay the same price for a ""do it yourself"" kind of place (type of food here is so simplistic that you CAN do it yourself) when you can go to a local Thai or Malaysian restaurant for a far better experience?"
67,"The WORST dining experience I've EVER had. I always come here and order my usual which is half Thai and half Malay sauce with hokkien noodles.  I've come here dozens of times and this is the only dish I order, since it has the perfect amount of spice and flavor. When my food came, it was covered with more red chili than usual. And it wasn't a little more but a LOT more. All I saw was red in my noodles. But I proceeded to eat it and so much spice hit my mouth, that I had tears running down my face. I've never had this dish so spicy before. It's as if they accidentally poured too much spice into it and proceeded along with serving it. I went to the woman at the counter and said that it was too spicy. She talked to the man next to her and then both said that's how it always is. I told her I always order this and it's never this spicy but she told me to ""just order another sauce next time"". So I went back to the table to eat, and after two more bites, I had formed huge blisters on the roof of my mouth because it was too spicy! I couldn't even eat it. I barely had three bites and couldn't handle it. My friend was with me and she also orders the same dish when she's there and said that there was way too much red chili pepper in it. I went back to the counter and told the same woman that there was extremely too much spice and that the spice had caused my mouth to blister. She rudely said ""well what do you want me to do?!"" And I asked if they could make one that wasn't as spicy. She refused to do so and said its always like that. I explained again that I always order this combo and that it was way more spicier than usual today and it formed blisters on my mouth. She kept arguing with me and told me that there was nothing wrong with it and that all she could do was to pack it up. I said ""okay"" because I didn't want to make a scene and realized it was pointless talking to her. She refused to do anything to help me or to fix my food. She didn't even show my food to the chef! I loved coming to this place and always introduced friends and family to it but vow to never come again. And after reading some of the other reviews, I know I'm not the only one who has experienced awful customer service. I am very disappointed, especially since this used to be my favorite place. I would give it two stars but I left the restaurant with an empty stomach and the people at the counter really disappointed me with their rude behaviors."
68,"Good idea, nice people, good prices, poorly executed.  Need a lot of improvement."
69,"Meh. I had the Hokkien noddles with the Thai sauce and combination adds. The noodles themselves were alright but the sauce didn't seem like anything special, and the shrimp and veggies weren't cooked very thoroughly. Not a bad option for someone on a budget, but not necessarily a quality meal. The place is still pretty new though, so I'll probably give them one more try later this year, albeit hesitantly."
