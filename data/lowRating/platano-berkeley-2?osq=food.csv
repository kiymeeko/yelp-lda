0,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
1,"The line is always super long, all the way out the door. Tonight we came early and decided to give Platano a try. This is our first time trying Salvadorian food, and the owner was really friendly and recommended us to try the special plates, which comes with a variety of dishes. The food took a really long time, and we were all starving by then. My favorite is definitely the pupusas, they are corn tortilla pockets stuffed with fillings, so good!! Plantains are sweat fried bananas, topped with beans and sour cream. Not so much a fan of chicken tamale. Food: 2/5Price:3/5Service: 3/5Ambience: 4/5Favorites:Pupusas - Beef and cheese#1 two pupusas and plantains, beans & cream ($9.75)#3 two pupusas side of plantain and cream ($9.75)Other orders:Pupusas - Cheese and Salvadoran flowerPupusas - revuelta con frijoles (tender pork, black beans and cheese)# 6 one pupusa, plantain & cream & chicken tamale($9.75)"
2,"$123.00 for tasteless food, poor service. My daughter ordered a  pan con pollo, a few bits in she found a hard piece of plastic. Horrible place!!!!!!!!!"
3,"I've been here before with a large group and the food was delicious. I came back with my my fiancé for dinner and we were seated right away with a great table. This is where things went downhill. The server for the table beyond ours proceeded to walk past us about 7 times over the course of ten minutes never offering to take an order, to say they'd be right with us, or give us water. We got menus and that's it. After sitting there for 10 minutes with servers walking past us like we were lepers we left. I'll stick to my go to Salvadorian spot in the Fruitvale that is way cheaper with better service."
4,"Food is 4/5 and service was 1/5.No complaints really about the food, we enjoyed it. But service: barely any words exchanged with out server in regards to a warm welcome or questions about the menu, except when we tried asking for more food than usual as I wanted to experiment the food and possibly take some home, and the server gave us a nasty, uncalled for remark and reaction as to why we are ordering what we did. That's what we wanted, and that's that.Other parties came after us (it was just the two of us) and they got food before us and our pupusa never came. The wait here is a problem but the way our waiter treated us was unacceptable."
5,"OMG!  Stay away!  My party of 5 waited 50 minutes for food to arrive.  When it did, my order of 2 pupusas did not come - ever!  After 8 minutes of waiting while everyone else was eating, I talked to the manager.  He told me, ""this happens all the time."".  I asked him how they even stay in business?  He shrugged his shoulders.   I asked again when my pupusas would be coming out and he said, ""Oh, do you want them?"".  Needless to say I left.  Makes zero sense."
6,"Came here on a Thursday evening for a graduation dinner. While waiting for our party to all arrive, the hostess didn't even acknowledge us a good 15 minutes after walking in. Finally when approached we told her what party we where with and gave her name, she then proceeded to sit us down in two separate tables back to back instead of combining both tables. The person who invited us to the dinner here had not arrived yet because she was outside looking for parking and she was with the graduate and most of her family. When they sat us down I guess they where under the assumption that we where separate groups, even though we gave the hostess the persons name that invited us here,and had made a reservation. The reason I say that is because the whole evening the waitress took our  orders separately from table to table so food came out at separate times. And it seems like we sat on the ""bad table"" because the person inviting us to dinner was in the table behind us and just overall got better service which I find ridiculous. They gave us very minimal attention when asking for basic things like water, utensils, napkins. The food was mediocre Salvadorian food. I've had much better tasting Pupusas and basic platano frito and beans elsewhere, and even other plates that where ordered from menu where not liked by many in our group even the ones that sat on the ""good table"".  I even heard a couple of people say that they would never come back.  Mind you the staff that work here know the person that was having her dinner here very well, So I really thought we would get at least more decent service.  But i guess that did not matter."
7,"Food was ok, I was expecting it to be better than the first time. I asked for the check almost 4 times...Service was terrible!!!!!! My family and I kept getting ignored. I don't think I'll be coming back."
8,Food is good but service is crap. I ended up getting sick at the restaurant. I wouldnt go back.
9,"Synopsis: Horribly smelly restaurant serves delicious food. Service is slow but friendly. // No parking. We parked a block away at the building where Chase bank is located. Went on a Friday afternoon. We were meeting friends with kids so we're looking for a restaurant that welcomed that. There is a small play area with books and toys that the toddlers enjoyed while we ate. But seriously, the smell in this restaurant is like moldy farts. I just got wafts of damp smelling mildew from...I don't even know where. Was it the open kitchen door, the floor, the food, the street? I don't know but it hits you the moment you walk in. We stayed because we didn't have time to change meeting places but I really wanted to leave because it stank so much and I was so embarrassed to have invited my friends there. Wish I had scouted out the place before arranging the meeting. Thank GOD the food was good. First time having pupusas and they're great. Also had the Carne Desilada with a side of plantains and refried beans which was delicious (would recommend choosing rice instead of beans though). Staff was friendly and accommodating. Would love to eat their food again but I'm definitely only going to do take-out."
10,"Food was good; service was slow, wrong, and rude.  It was also crazy, crazy loud.  Like full volume shouting loud.  But the deal breaker was the slow, unfriendly, un-customer service oriented service."
11,"Food is okay, and the servers are friendly, only if they are available to you... It often takes more than 30 minutes for them to make your order, and the restaurant's layout often makes it hard to call a server from your table."
12,"My experience here was not phenomenal. I made reservations. We arrived and stood around for at least 10 minutes without anyone approaching us at all. Like....the servers looked at us, made eye contact, and never said anything. At all. Finally (after tenish awkward minutes) someone came over and brought us to a table....that was surrounded by children's toys. What???? Yeah. We ordered our food. It came out in a relatively timely manner, but they got our order mixed up with the table beside us. That took a while to get sorted out. The food was...ok. It wasn't nearly as flavorful as I would have hoped. I would have to say the food was better than the service, but not by much. I don't think I will be going back here."
13,"Pupusas are delicious! After finding out this place has them, I was more than tempted to give it a try. I've been here twice & the first time I came here was the better experience. But for both experiences, service was moving at a glacial pace. I can't even exaggerate because it's the truth. It took us over 30 minutes to receive food after placing our order and later found out it was because there was a mix-up between whether it was for take-out or dine-in. Should it matter? The waiter entered our order for take-out. I would think that it would speed up the process but instead, it made it much slower. Half the time I noticed that waiters were just walking around and talking. It didn't seem like they were working even though the restaurant was a little more than half full. I thought coming back, the service would improve but I was disappointed to find out that that's how it is. As for the food, I love the salad. I forget what it's called, but it had avocado, black beans, red onions and tomatoes for a bed of mixed greens. What truly makes the salad is the cilantro lime sauce. Replicating it would require a food processor, one of the kitchen appliances I lack, so I opt to come here and enjoy it drizzled over my salad. And of course, I came here for the pupusas. I loved their chicken and beef pupusas (separate orders). I may just take pupusas to go if I decide to come back. The memory of slow service may deter me from coming back unfortunately. These days, I've been pressed for time and waiting for my food would not make me a happy camper."
14,"This place has very decent food but expect abysmal service. If they are slightly busy, expect to sit around waiting for a long time before ordering, getting water, and food. They are greatly understaffed always and that means you won't enjoy your experience. We've had a few terrible experiences here now and frankly it's better to go to the pupuseria in oakland on fruitvale instead of this place. Way too hyped and way too understaffed."
15,"We came here for dinner on a Wednesday night, saw that the restaurant was pretty packed and were excited to try this place out. The first caveat of the evening was our waiter did not clean our table before seating us, he merely took away the plates and silverware from the previous guest and placed two menus down on the table. Yuck. I ordered the Pollo Asado, which came out in a timely manner. However, I was shocked to see that the piece of chicken I received was minuscule in proportion to the amount of salad and Casamiento rice on the plate. The chicken itself ran on the dry and tasteless side. My boyfriend ordered the Carne Asado, the meat on his plate was also small in proportion to the sides he ordered. The only good thing about the dish I ordered was the Casamiento rice, which I have to hand it to the restaurant - good balance between chewy and crunchy. When we finished eating and asked our waiter for the check, he VANISHED! We waited and waited and WAIIITTTTEEEDD..... I eventually had to walk over to the other side of the restaurant - the bar area - and ask another waiter to bring us our check. The food is lacking, the service is lacking even more. I would hesitate to come here again."
16,"This review is not for the food, which is pretty decent. I was ordering take out around 11:45am. The restaurant was empty. After I came in, many people came in and ordered. They received their food and were almost done eating and I had still not received mine. I told them that I had been waiting almost half an hour (it was 12:12pm at this time). One of the guys went to go check. When they gave me the food, I told them that this took way too long, people who came after me began eating. And they started arguing with me. They were SO mean!! They said comments like what do you expect, this is not a fancy restaurant. You didn't even wait that long. How is half an hour not long? I showed them the receipt with the time on it, and they were just saying snarky comments and walking away. It was such a horrible experience, and I was so polite. I'm honestly astonished at how mean people can be."
17,"Their pupusas are filling and delicious. We tried 5 different ones and everything taste great.However, I don't think I will ever return because service was horrible! Our server ended up spending most of her time talking to her friends at the table next to us. She never came to check up on us and we had to grab her attention to bring us the bill, which took forever for some reason."
18,"Decent to good food, but subpar and rude service. I will not be eating here again, as my last visit ruined this experience. The service and rudeness kept getting worse and worse during each visit. If you're wondering what did it? It was the audacity from the cook to come out from the kitchen, bring back the plate that was returned (they got wrong order), place it on the table and blame the customer for ordering an item from their menu that they did not want to make. I can go on and on, but you get the gist. If you're keen for decent/good service, then avoid this place."
19,"I'll preface my review by saying I'm Cuban who cooks with plantains since it's a Cuban staple.A place with the name Platano, you'd think they would have that dish as the specialty. Unfortunately the plantains were not sweet with the caramelized finish. Very starchy taste to them. See my photo as proof.  The beans and cream it came with was fine but that's about it. Very disappointed with the plantains. Ordered Mar y Tierra for entree. Rice was nice and fluffy. Black beans were bland, not seasoned at all. I asked for more of the diced tomato salsa (chimole, which they charged me $1 for, wth. How about telling me there's a charge before bringing it to me) to help with flavor. The steak and shrimp were grilled nicely and had good flavor. Those items were great. Drink, plantains, entree with extra charge for chimole came to $29!! Are you kidding me? Expensive. Either I am not a fan of Salvadorean food or making this the Cuban way would have tasted so much better. Won't come back because of the prices. 4 stars for service. 2 stars for food. I came for the food so 2 stars overall."
20,"Our food did not come out for literally 1 entire hour. There was four of us, and we each ordered only papusas.. I do not think that it takes an hour to make papusas and there was barely any customers there... this was quite disappointing especially because it is a place that all of us have thoroughly enjoyed dining at in the past.Otherwise, the papusas here is pretty good. Should also try their sangria, it's more worth it to split the bottle between 2-3 people."
21,I was looking for sweet plantains. I was disappointed. The waiter was very polite and the meal was pretty good. The low rating is for the plantains.
22,"Big, spacey restaurant. The food is very tasty and flavorful, but the service was extremely slow. No one checked on us, and I'm probably now eligible for an AARP discount after the amount of time I waited for them to take our credit cards.  We came at 4:34pm, when there were only 3 other tables seated, and the waiters were no where to be found whenever we needed them. They'd hang out together in the back or kitchen, and only pop their heads out every once in a while. on to the food: (it's fun that they provide a picture booklet of their menu items to help you decide!)*Plantains: good, but quite dense and not very sweet. It wasn't soft and chewy like I thought it would be.*Pupusa: not super impressed. We ordered the one with pork and cheese, and I felt like it was all cheese. Basically tasted like a thick-crusted cheese pizza. *Pastelitos: crunchy, warm, and good paired with the salsa! get this. *Dinner plate (comes with choice of 2 sides): Carne Desilada. delicious! for one of your sides, choose ""Casamiento"", it's a delicious combination of rice and black beans. Why would you choose rice and black beans as two separate sides when you can get them in one? :) overall: tasty, decently priced meal, but do not go if you are in a rush or on a tight schedule"
23,This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants until this night when they shit on me. They shit on me real good. I wanted to come here to break Passover (ended at 8:32 tonight) because it was my favorite. Their sign says and everyone on the internet says they close at 9. I get there at 8:30 and they turn me away. I'm so disappointed. It's unbelievable. I think I'll find another papusa restaurant. Thanks for shitting on my post Passover experience you ass holes.
24,"The food was pretty great and I would go back for it. However, they pulled SHADY SH*T!  We both ordered the pupusa and platano combo for 8.95, or so we thought.  As the waiter is taking our order, he points to the menu and says ""it's a different price"" but doesn't elaborate.  His English  isn't perfect,  it was late on a Saturday night, and I thought he was maybe saying the combo was a better deal?  WE get the bill and he has charged us for two LUNCH SPECIALS at 10.75 each.  BUNK! I asked and he said ""I told you it's a different price"" all annoyed. Very scammy feeling. Either change your menu or tell people ""That's 10.75"" when you order it.  Over all, between the delicious food, the extra strong cleaning fluid they were mopping with, and the scammy vibe, I did feel like I was in Central America again as a tourist!"
25,"Been here on several occasions and thought the food was fine but after the terrible service I received last night I doubt I will go back. After being ignored at the door we were seated and our orders were taken. Our draft beers arrived 2/3 full, followed by our food, that was the last time any of the wait staff paid any attention, not a single follow up on the food, water, if we would like another beer, not a thing. After waiting a bit for our check, I had to go to the bar to ask for the bill. In an area with so many choices I think Platano will no longer be mine."
26,"I waited 55 minutes for 3 pupusas, they were good and still hot, however, the waiting time made me almost lose my appetite. I was warned about this by other friends, too.."
27,"Just hate it when I sound like a kvetcher.To be candid, when the only redeeming thing I can find to report is the nice flavor of the pickled curtido, something is def amiss! Tamales ordered were stale and crumbly when slicing into with fork. So hard, in fact, that 1/3 of it fell to the floor from lack of fluffiness of masa.Plantains were not carmelized sufficiently and left me feeling like they were still bit raw. Cold too.Pupusas were also not impressive for me. Unfortunately, I prefer others' in the area for taste and quality. I shant be back!!!"
28,"This place has great food, but horrible service!! The server didn't check up on us and took over 15 mins to take our order and not to mention he took over 20 mins to pick up our plates and give us the check! Bad bad service!!"
29,"Basic flavors without enough strong tastesI've had Salvadoran food before and was never enamored with it. The food just lacked enough strong flavors and seasoning. Unfortunately Platano fit into that same mold. I went there with my extended family so we ordered a large number of dishes. We started with Platanos, fried plantains with refried beans and creme. Love fried plantains, but the mix with the beans which were served like a sauce was a little off putting. Would've liked to have had just the plantains. We then moved onto the Tamales De Sal which had chicken inside. Were good enough, but needed a LOT of sauce. Also tried the Pastelitos which was fried masa stuffed with chicken. Again needed some sauce or something else with it to make it really sing, but that was lacking. The last small dish was Papusa which is a thick tortilla with stuffing. What you get is the strong doughy corn flavor with the inside tasting rather plain. Our main courses consisted of Pollo Asado. Was a nice piece of grilled chicken cooked very well, but again no zing to it. Costillas de Puerco was pork spare ribs served with a Bistec sauce. Like everything else the sauce wasn't strong enough to give the dish enough flavor. No matter what the dish was you had the same basic feeling after tasting it, there wasn't enough strong flavor."
30,"Terrible service, food was good but a bit dry, needed some kinda sauce... Woulda been ok if we had drinks to moisten it up with while we ate, but nobody ever bothered to check on us/try to upsell more drinks, so we kinda had to eat without beverages... Not good when the food is dry. Oh well, I've had worse, but that doesn't inspire me to ever come back or recommend this place to anyone. Go somewhere else imho~"
31,My husband and I have been coming here for a couple of years and their food is great but there staff is not so friendly. We decided to visit them since we had 2 friends from out of town and service was denied because they were closing at 9pm and we got there at 8:35pm. They said that their kitchen was closing soon. The place was full and there was no way everyone was going to be out at 9pm.
32,"First of all let me start by saying the food is great. Really great. We had the shrimp and it was excellent. Pupusas were great, plantains were excellent. The chef is saving this restaurant.The service was a joke. Please see my other reviews, I rarely give bad reviews. After waiting over 10 minutes I had to ask our waitress for our drinks. She brought half of them, appetizers came after the dinner, had to find someone for our bill and after watching 6 employees all hang out and chat at the center bar I had to walk up and hand them my credit card after waiting way too long. Note to owner. Give your chef a raise. Immediately hire a wait staff manager, train them, fire some and unfortunate I don't think you can take a day off for a while. You would have been so pissed to see our waitress laugh and joke and forget she was a waitress.Great food."
33,"The food here is really good. Especially the papusas. I drive here a few times a month all the way from Alameda just for the papusas. I feel that today will be my last time. The customer service was awful. Today was the third time I waited well over an hour for my food with out one person working there even acknowledging the fact that I had been sitting there waiting for my order. Today I called in the order to pick up and was told 10-15 mins. I drove all the way from Alameda so it took me about 25 mins to get there. Once I got there, I paid and sat down to wait. I figured my order would already be done being that I arrived 10 minutes or so after the time I was told it would be ready to pick up. Well, I sat there for another 50 mins or so. I grew increasingly frustrated as I watched people that came in after me getting their to-go orders before me. People at tables who arrived after me getting their food as well. Now mind you, while all of this is happening, not one person working approached me to apologize and offer me an explication, not even something to drink while I waited. I finally decided to take it upon myself to speak up and ask about my food along with mentioning I called in my order over an hour ago. Still no explanation, no offer of resolution, nothing. I finally received my food about an hour and 20 mins after I  ordered it. One of the men working there, I would assume is the manager or owner, asked me if I had already paid. I told him yes. Then his response to me was, do you want a drink. I told him no, and that I was really disappointed in the level of service. I told him I that I was really unhappy that I sat there for like 45-50 minutes and not one person acknowledged me or the situation until I spoke up on my own. I was clearly upset. He told me that I was right and he agreed with me. But he didn't offer any sort of resolution at all! Didn't offer to reimburse me, didn't offer to take care of me next time, nothing. He sees me in there all the time, clearly recognizes me as a regular customer, but obviously doesn't value me as a customer. With that being said, I don't think I will ever return. It really sucks for me because I love the food so much."
34,"Terrible service. My family waited 10 minutes before we were acknowledged to be seated. The waitress Carmen Sanchez acted like we were completely invisible. The only time she came to our table is when we called her. We called her to order our food. We called her for drinks and refills. We called her to ask where our food was. It wasn't until we called her that she felt compelled to service us. It totally killed our experience, and the food suffered because of it. We will never go back!"
35,"Came here once. Will never go back. It is the highest priced pupuseria I have ever seen. I ordered the platanos fritos. They weren't ripe - hard and inedible. When I pointed this out, the waitress said something to the effect of: ""Sometimes that happens.""Getting bad platanos at a restaurant named platano...Give it a miss.. go to another neighborhood, like Fruitvale."
36,"Let me start off by being absolutely honest, this is dumbed-down Salvadorian food (i.e. there is jack cheese in the popusas). While at the restaurant I began to write this review with two stars (already not a good sign and I was tempted to just cancel my order and go home). Once our food actually came it quickly dropped to one.As soon as I saw the color on my horchata I could tell where this was going. It was terrible, even the pre-made mix that they sell at the supermarket tastes miles better than this. But my biggest issue was the popusas, which not only lacked flavor (and thats putting it mildly as I had never fathomed the need to put salt on a popusa before coming here)  but the ""curtido"" that usually comes with it was watered down and had remnants of what seemed like italian dressing!In all fairness it's a clean and friendly place. The food is simply not worth it. Next time I much rather drive an extra 15 minutes for some flavorful Salvadorian food in Oakland."
37,"I was looking for a tasty cilantro dressing and landed upon this place thanks to yelp.  I ordered the avocado salad with chicken.  I was charged $5 for a small leg and thigh.  I expected a few slices of grilled chicken breasts.. Nonetheless, the chicken was pretty good.  The salad was watery which made the dressing bland when I poured it all in. The dressing was more of a cilantro vinaigrette and not the creamy cilantro dressing I was looking for (which I found just a few doors away at another brazillian café the next day).  Overall, the salad would have been good without the extra water.. But $15 for a salad with chicken?  No thanks."
38,"I'm giving this place a second star because the food really was delicious. The reason it gets a poor rating is that they gave me gluten poisoning after pretending they knew exactly what I needed and had it handled, and the service was insanely slow and neglectful.I don't know what the other GF reviewers are talking about because, even after I told the waiter that I'm allergic to gluten (really, truly allergic - not gluten free by ""choice,"" for the GF-haters out there), I was not offered a gluten-free menu. My partner and I went to this restaurant for the first time this past Mother's Day. We ordered several pupusas, yucca fries, and fried plantains as well as the seafood soup, which the waiter assured me repeatedly were all gluten free. So the food arrived and we dove in - it was all delicious, especially the seafood soup. Then I discovered that the soup had surimi (imitation crab) in it and went into a panic. We called the waiter over and pointed out the concern, and he again assured us the dish was gluten free. I told him surimi was NEVER gluten free, so he went back to the kitchen to check. Sure enough, he came back and said it wasn't, mumbled something about a ""new chef,"" insisted that my partner keep eating it (we were on a date, and this meant there was no way my partner could kiss me), and that he'd bring me a new one. Other celiacs out there know this would not in any way fix the problem, but I appreciated the gesture. I popped all the gluten-digestion pills I had in my purse and just hoped for the best.The ""new soup"" was literally a cup and a half of broth with nothing in it - ""for my safety."" I'm not allergic to seafood, and I have a hard time believing there were no clams, fish, etc. in the kitchen that hadn't already been made into the soup. An order of the soup is $17 - by far the most expensive thing we ordered - because of all these amazing things they put in it, and somehow this itty-bitty bowl of broth was supposed to be an adequate replacement. I started drinking it anyway, but my allergic reaction got worse - possibly just the surimi taking its toll - so I stopped drinking it out of caution.The waiter also offered us free drinks as an apology. We told him we weren't interested in drinking and asked if it was possible to get another side of fried yucca ($3.75), since that was our favorite of the safe dishes we'd ordered. He acted taken aback by the request and said NO - drinks only. We said we'd just forgo them, but he insisted that we at least get sparkling water, so we said okay (just ended up taking them home, and they're still in the fridge).I mentioned poor service, too - all this happened over the course of a couple of hours because the waiter was nowhere to be found for much of the time, and it took us nearly 20 minutes to get the check once we were done. We were also charged for the offending soup.For the two weeks after this dinner, I was in absolute hell. I won't describe the symptoms here, but I could barely eat anything because of the state of my mouth and overall system - just awful. My partner called to speak with the manager a day or two after we'd eaten there to inform him of what had happened. To his credit, the manager was very apologetic, but he also claimed to ""remember that happening"" while repeatedly referring to the wrong day; no idea whether he'd actually been there. He offered us a free meal, but I'm scared to go back. I realize it's always a risk to eat anywhere that isn't exclusively gluten free, but when a place purports to be competent at dealing with those of us who're cursed with overreactive immune systems, I try to give it a chance (and myself a break from my own cooking). While I also understand that mistakes happen, this was among the least gracious responses I've gotten from a restaurant (not including the manager's response, which was an improvement, but a bit too little, too late)."
39,"Where has the quality gone.  I used to recommend this place highly to ppl after eating here in the summer of 2010.  I went to Plantano just the other day and it was NOT good!  Microwaved, previously frozen food is unacceptable...people can tell!!  I can tell!!!The food had flavor but everything was dry and mushy.On the way out the waiter asked how everything was...I asked if they had the same cook and he said yes.  I told him something was off with the food.  He agreed.  I said the food was not that good and he nodded."
40,Spare yourself. Valentines day night they were not on their best. I regret every penny I spent there. Especially because I ended up paying double what I had anticipated; upon realizing I had been reading the lunch menu. Just no. Food was decent and that's the only reason I gave it two stars.
41,"Salvadorian? Sounds nice and exotic! .... Right?But ehh. I don't have many specific criticisms, just that I felt like the food was in general a bit dry and ordinary. The tamales had really dry chicken meat, and the rest of the tamale was pretty bland and one dimensional. I felt like I was eating mush that eventually made my head hurt a bit.Service was good but slow. Food took forever to be served, and when they finally came, they were fairly small in portion and not all that satisfying in taste either.Atmosphere is good; it'd be a good place for group gatherings. Decor is simple and comfortable, so you're free to sit and chat for as long as you want :)"
42,"Stopped by Platano after some great acupuncture a block away, and I had a pleasant but sort of underwhelming meal. I got the platanos and a chicken tamale, and my bf got two kinds of pupusas. The pupusas are pretty cheap and good. I love me some plantains, but I found these plaintains really oily. I don't really care for it being served with crema and refried beans, but I did try it. The chicken tamale was kind of disappointing - way too soft with very little substance."
43,"Flavors are alright.  It's not as flavorable as I would have liked it.. but is worth a try if you've never had Salvadoran cuisine.  It's a lot of food, and the flavors run together a bit to much...No special mentions; nothing really stood out to me.  See photo of Yucca Cosida O Frita.  Carne Asada was standard.-- Tamales de EloteThese are NOT stuffed with anything.  It's good but you can only eat so much corn... regardless of whether it's fried or steamed.Dinner for 3 = $43.50"
44,"Ugh I am really torn with this review. Our service was really horrible. It took ~10 mins after we sat down to even get some attention. We waited at least another 20-30 mins for our order to come out. It appeared that there was only 1 waiter and the busboy so at first I was sympathetic. However the waiter and busboy clearly had their priorities skewed as they were cleaning and taking care of other things instead of delivering food, taking orders and being friendly. Our waiter never apologized for taking forever to get to us or asked how our meal was or if we needed anything. The sangria was tasty and had a nice citrus undertone without being too sweet. Our pupusas were tasty, my favorite being the black bean and cheese. Their slaw is good and so is the salsa, however I wish it was thicker and not as runny. I will go back again for the pupusas and hope for better service."
45,"I was in Berkeley for a work trip and one of my coworkers found this place on Yelp so we decided to give it a try.  All 4 of us left somewhat disappointed by both the service and the food.  The plantains were underfried and unimpressive.  We tried the pupusa with the ""Salvadorean flower"" which our waiter recommended, and all we could taste was the cheese (no flower?) - and this ended up being the favorite.  My carne desilada wasn't very flavorful, and my friend's Albondigas were lackluster meatballs as well.  My other friend ordered the tilapia after the waiter wasn't very effective at describing how the fish included scales and bones (she questioned what was meant by ""whole fish"").  After we saw the picture of the fish on their helpful menu picture book (ask for this! Our waiter gave it to us after we started asking too many questions about the entrees), we got the attention of our waiter she changed her order 5 minutes later.  Then, another couple minutes later, one of the cooks(?) from the kitchen came out to our table and said, ""we already started cooking the fish.""   Why did he feel the need to confront the customer that way?  Was he implying she should stick with the fish even though she didn't want it?  It ended up taking us a long time to get our food (and an even longer amount of time to get our bill), so we doubt the tilapia was already cooking.  There are better Salvadorean restaurants in the bay area."
46,First and probably last visit. First thing that I noticed was weird stench entering the facility. Could be old carpet or ventilation. I/my wife ordered 1) Deep Fried Plantains with refried beans/sour cream. Plantains were good. 2) Black bean and cheese papusas. Kind of soggy and bland. 3) Pescado Frito: It's just deep fried and salted whole fish. Nothing more to it. Service is friendly however if you can understand the accent of servers :)
47,"This place was such a let down.  When I found that Berkeley had a salvadorean restaurant I was filled with hope that maybe they could get if not all the dishes at least a damn pupusa or platanos! But they didn't even come close! The wait for our food was long and the waitress came back twice to ask us again what we wanted.  As for the food... the pupusas were oily as hell! and they used the wrong cheese! The curtido was bland and lacked any resemblance to curtido in taste. the platanos con crema y frijoles was such a let down! they burned some and others were raw still! the frijoles were obviously from a can. I asked about empanadas de platano and the waitress looked at me dumbfounded and said they didn't have those. Apparently they are called a different thing here, pastelitos or something like that. Overall I am never going back! I am sad that I have yet to find a good Salvadorean place! If you have any ideas, help me please!"
48,"I was there for dinner with a friend. From what I remember I had no problem with the food and initial service, but the server took the liberty of upgrading my CC tip to 25% which is more than what I wrote down... Take it for what it's worth, I am never coming back. Not a good feeling knowing that they just stole from me."
49,"Good pupusas. Terrible service. The owner didn't want to honor my groupon because it was expired, which he has to do for the amount I paid for it. Had to argue with him to get him to accept it. Then he let me sit there for a half hour without getting me my food, while the people all around me were getting their food and leaving the restaurant. I was still going to tip him, though, because that's just what you do, but then when I asked him for change to leave him a tip, he first didn't give me my correct change back, and then when I asked him to fix it, he disappeared for five minutes. Hard to believe it was an accident after all that."
50,"Our impression: Lousy service and mediocre food.Last night we ate here for the third (and final) time.  Platano has gone down hill since it opened.  Our steaks were cheap cuts that were tough from overcooking and untrimmed so the edges had grizzle.  Not terrible, but not good.But most disappointing is the service.  Our waiter seemed to care less about getting our food out promptly.  In fact, all of the waiters spent more time in the kitchen joking around with each other (you can hear them) than attending to customers on the floor.  He never brought water.  He forgot to bring our wine, so we had to ask when our appetizer arrived - he didn't apologize.  He never stopped back to ask if our food was satisfactory or if we needed anything else for our meal.  And the clincher ... instead of asking if we wanted dessert, he simply dumped the check on our table and casually said 'the kitchen is now closed'.  Wow, that's rude!  Who needs to pay for that kind of treatment?  Not us."
51,"I really think that people rate this place so highly because they are trying to be into some type of food that is hard to find around the area (outside the mission I would venture to guess that it is not common). Whatever the reason though, it is pretty meh. The food is overpriced for both the portions and the quality. The steak was not very good and was sort of chewy. I will not get pretentious and say something like ""it was uninspired,"" but man give it shot to make your items shine. If you are in the mood for some latin food and are not afraid to pay more, then go around the corner to Comal for better food that is a little overpriced (but good latin food is hard to come by in Berkeley).This place needs to up their game in both the food and service departments as I have had mostly inattentive service when here. Though once or twice the service was pretty good and one time the steak was cooked better, but still not good enough for its price."
52,"Taste: 3Value: 4Service: 3I ordered the beef with tomato puree with bell peppers and onions. We came here with a group of about 20 for a friend's birthday dinner. I would have given them 3 stars, but unfortunately:1) The meat was overcooked and a bit tough.2) There was so much salt that I ended up with heartburn.3) Some water had spilled underneath the table before we were seated, and my shoes were wet the entire time.4) We had to call the waiter over to get our bill.5) They have a wireless connection, but they said it ""doesn't work."""
53,"The restaurant itself was really clean and cute. The food wasn't so bad but I've definitely had better. We ordered the Pescado Frito and that was pretty good. But the pupusas, pastelitos and the tamales were not so great. The wait staff was extremely slow and took awhile to take our order. I don't think they ever refilled our water. It took a really long time for them to finally bring our check and when they did, they added on a gratuity of 25% for a party of two, which I really felt they didn't deserve."
54,"DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU ENJOY HAVING NO SAY IN HOW MUCH YOU TIP!  A gratuity was automatically added to our check.  Sure, parties of 6+ is the norm but for two? Service was fine except after receiving our food, they never came back to check on us until the very end when we asked for our check."
55,I didn't care for their food. It's not horrible but to my taste buds it's just blah... Nothing exciting. If you are looking for great Latin American food this not the palace to go...
56,"I had high hopes. Salvadorean food near campus? Sounds like a win. Except for the following:It's the only place I know that reliably takes OVER 30 minutes for takeout orders to be ready, every time, which jibes with everyone else's reports that service is slow when you dine in as well.Its pupusas are just OK, kind of rubbery around the edges, with the thinnest salsa I've ever had (it's like water). Anyone who says they're the best they've had probably hasn't had 'em outside Berkeley.The atmosphere is usually quiet and dead like a lot of restaurants on University. Isn't eating out supposed to be at least a little festive?The search continues."
57,"Service is really slow, and unresponsive.  My steak was well seasoned, but severely overcooked.  The accompanying salad and rice were done well, but the pupusas were bland."
58,"Eating at Platano the other night was bugging me enough that I wrote the owner a letter.  But, in typical me fashion, I don't have the heart (or balls) to send it.  I will post it here in hopes that maybe she might read it and so that it could give fellow Yelpers an idea of what to expect when you dine here.  This place definitely gets five stars for the food (okay, maybe minus a star for the curtido but the namesake platanos?  - dios mio - SO good!) and 1 star for the sad service.  Dear Ms. Mischler:I love Salvadoran cuisine and was looking forward to trying out your restaurant.  When we arrived the restaurant was half empty and there were two servers on the floor.  We were told to sit ""wherever"" and so we took a seat along the wall closer to the kitchen since it was cold inside the restaurant and sitting by the door would have made it worse.My first impression of the restaurant was that someone had put a lot of thought into the decor.  That much is evident but the restaurant was so brightly lit that it was like sitting in a surgical suite.  There was  a burnt out votive candle on our table but it was early in the evening so I doubt that it had been lit and then burned out since those votives last for five hours.  Dimming the lights and lighting votives on the tables would go far in making the room an already gorgeous room seem warmer.  We were seated and shortly, our server brought us water and we were ready to order.  We placed our order and waited.  And waited.  Then waited some more.  I understand that it takes a while to make the pupusas so I am used to the wait.  Have you ever considered putting some chips and salsa on the tables?  It would make the wait seem less interminable.   When our food did arrive, we were so happy!  The pupusas de arroz con revueltas were the best ones I have ever had.  The chicharron was deliciously flavorful.  The albondigas were really quite delicious as well as the casamiento.  I love the little glass containers for the salsa and curtido.  I think that's a really nice touch.  However, the curtido had no flavor whatsoever.  It was watery - seemed to have little or almost no vinegar and you could not taste the oregano at all.  I am used to curtido having a little bit of chile flake in it as well to give it a little extra kick - instead of adding to the wonderful flavor of the pupusas, the curtido detracted.  Other than the curtido, the food was some of the best Salvadoran food I've ever had.Once our food was placed on our table it was like we disappeared.  Our server never came by to ask how our food was or if we needed anything.  We never got our tortillas with our albondigas and our water glasses were empty.  I would have liked to have another grape soda but never go the chance to order it.  I have heard that the flan you serve is excellent but we sat there, our plates empty for a long time and no one came by to clear our plates or place dessert menus on our table.  I will put up with a lot for good food and your food is wonderful.  But I don't know if I can go back to your restaurant.  The service is unskilled and indifferent.  Hiring a busser to clear plates, fill water glasses and support your servers would be a great step.  I watched people leave their table to fetch a server because they needed something.   I watched people sit there and wait for a spoon for their soup.  Or wait to begin eating their pupusas because the salsa and curtido were not placed on their tables.   I heard the order bell toll incessantly which might be the reason that our albondigas, while utterly delicious, were cold.   I really hope you can get your service issues ironed out - you have a beautiful space with delicious food and I want to come back and enjoy it.  Sincerely,a concerned pupusa lover"
59,We read the Yelp reviews prior to going and we should have listened to our fellow Yelpers because our experience at Platano was similar to a lot of the reviews. Pupusas were underwhelming. I had the lorocco one and it was basically all cheese and no lorocco. I also ordered a plate of the platanos with black beans and crema. They were just average and the black beans were over salted. My fiancee had the albondigas plate and he really enjoyed his meal. The meatballs were full of flavor and the sauce was tasty. The service was slow and when my fiancee asked for a refill of his water (he had to ask!) our waitress just refilled his and ignored my glass. I believe that there are TONS of better pupusa places out there in the Bay Area. I can't wait to find them!
60,"There's a trick to eating here: eat your fill first, then come here, wait, be seated, wait, order, wait some more, and you're hungry again when your food arrives!My hypothesis is this: they make you wait an hour and a half before bringing out the food, so that you're starving when it comes and you think it's amazingly good.Maybe it is amazingly good. I really don't know. It seemed that way, but I was in no state to judge that. And I'm not going back."
61,"The pupusas really are fairly tasty. If you utilize the cabbage, you shouldn't be too hungry. But the service is horrific. Lunch will easily turn into 2 hours. The place is usually pretty empty, yet the wait for anything is ridiculous. Even if you are the only table in the place, they are unable to prepare your food at the same time. Once, we had a fairly large group and one dish never came out. Because of the staggered delivery, it was impossible to tell that they forgot it until the first two deliveries were done with their plates! With lunch now getting close to 2 hours, a few had to leave."
62,"Sorry Platano, you did everything you could for me not to return...- The waitress seemed reluctant to take our order (constant frown)- The food took over an hour and 30 minutes to materialize- During that time we were not approached for any reason: did we want water? status of our food? etc.- When the food did finally arrive, one of our orders was wrong. No apologies made.It's too bad too. I love Salvadorian food and really wanted to support a business here in Berkeley- and not have to drive to the Fruitvale for pupusas.Guess I will still look to Oakland."
63,"So I went earlier today to order food. Initially, I wanted to try a salad and get two pupusas on the side to which the server suggested I'd get the #2 Lunch Special instead so I agreed. He rang me up but when I was going to get my food to take out the other server only brought me a big avocado salad and no pupusas. the original server said he only charged me for the big salad but I told him I wanted order #2. When I asked him well can you redo my order he said yes but that he would have to charge me. Needless to say, I'm not eating here again. I would completely understand had the restaurant been really busy and occupied to get the order wrong but when he even suggested I get another order and then not get the order that he suggested and which I agreed to is complete ridick. Now I have the avocado salad thinking it was going to be solid chunks of avocado slices. the ""avocado"" is nothing but watered-down sauce that taste like avocado but isnt. One freaking salad costs me $8 ridick. Was it an honest human mistake? perhaps but if youve been working there for a while you should get your act together. Overpriced and not worth it."
64,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, as there are not many El Salvadorian places in the area, but was very disappointed when I went there with my friends last month.  The service was awful (the waiter listened to me recite the whole order after which he asked me to repeat the whole order!)  The appetizer came after we got our entrees, which came 45 mins after we ordered.  So you can imagine how hungry we were, and the food did not at all live up to our expectations.  The food was just ok, nothing special.  I will say their sangria was pretty good, but overall, I would not come back to this place."
65,"This place has possibly the slowest service i've ever experienced. they forgot two orders, then charged us twice when they reordered. The food was good, but definitely did not make up for the terrible service, especially when there were a total of 12 customers in the restaurant."
66,"Parking on University is scary. I've seen too many people smack into the cars they're parked next to while trying to get out. There is a pay lot right behind the Nash Hotel which is right across the street from this El Salvadoran restaurant. It's also super-close to the Downtown Berkeley BART station.I spent quite a bit of time outside the restaurant looking at the posted menu. Things looked good. I walked into the restaurant and was hit--no SMACKED DOWN--but the awful smell. The host said it was from the hair salon next door. The odor was slightly reminiscent of hair coloring chemicals, but it was more like zombie hair coloring chemicals. Imagine, if you would, that these chemicals had been injected with a virus, and imagine that said virus turned these chemicals into the walking undead, full of the stench that comes with rotting inorganics. But this was worse; you couldn't fight off the advancing danger with a board with a nail on it. After a while, I'm sorry to say, I got used to it.It was a bit confusing at first as no one came to greet me for quite a while after I walked in. After that, things seemed to go smoothly.I have to say that one MUST have pupusas at this joint. They are yummy and have all sorts of filling options. Their plantains with beans and a light sour cream-type sauce were  very good. The fried yucca with pork was pretty good. The fried pork was a bit tough, but I found it tasty with the plantain sauce. The enchiladas were like open faced sandwiches. They fried the hell out of the tortillas on the bottom. The pastelitos were croquette-like except that they were fried beyond belief. They were just okay.I tried this drink that I can't find on the online menu. It was a warm, milky, corny, sugary concoction that is worth a try. The El Salvadoran cream soda had a interesting kick.I am NOT a flan person, so I found it horrid, but my partner seemed to like it, and the server told us it was one of the best desserts on their menu.Overall, their dishes are great to share and are very filling."
67,"I ate at this place a few weeks ago.  The food is so-so, and some is less so.  The service was poor at best.  It was basically so lame I feel it necessary to say something about it.  If you want good pupusas go to the outer mission, it's that simple.  I wish it wasn't true, but I'm sad to say seems so in my experiences thus far."
68,"First of all, I LOVE food and always open to recommendations. So when a handful of my co.workers/friends recommended PLATANO, I decided to give it a shot. Let's just say: I walked away disappointed, confused, and although not hungry - I was simply NOT happy. The food was not interesting and everything appeared to be overcooked and dry. My BF ordered the thinly sliced beef cooked with egg and grilled pepper, the beef was SO thinly sliced - it didn't even LOOKED or tasted like beef. It kinda reminded me off hair cooked with random items. On the other hand, I ordered the CARNE ASADA and it was dry, salty, and TOUGH. The salad lack any personality and the MASA was tasteless and lack any favor of CORN.Overall, if you want GOOD salvadoran cuisine - go to the MISSION in SF."
69,Tiny servings and apathetic service staff (bordering on rude) make this an over expensive alternative to Tropix on  Piedmont Ave.  Reduce the price by 30% and improve customer service and it wont be so empty.
70,"The food ( carne asada and beef stew) was alright but not great. We had to wait for it for over an hour to get it!  First we waited seemingly forever for the waiter to take our order, and if a member of the group hadn't flagged a waiter down, who knows how long we would have waited! There was a fish on the menu that supposed to take fifteen minutes to cook and that would have been MUCH shorter than the time they took to prepare our food!!  We were so starving when the food came, that pretty much anything would have been tasty. The place is terribly understaffed. We would not go there again unless they hire a lot more help.  We wanted to leave a small tip, but the bill came with a mandatory 18% tip!"
71,"Salvadoran foodAt least 1 star LESS than Los Cocos (in Oakland)OK food. OK, not great, value for money.Service fair.We'll not go back"
72,"The food was very good, but I am only giving it two stars because of the extremely slow service.  Taking our order was slow, bringing the food was slow, getting the check was slow, even processing the credit card was slow!  Don't go here if you are hungry because it seriously took over an hour and a half from entering the restaurant to getting our food and it's not like it was particularly busy or anything.I really want to like this place, but until they hire more people, this place is on my AVOID list."
73,"Updated review- I had previously given this place a good review. Now I am rescinding it.I had the worst service I have experienced at any restaurant the other night. Came in on a Friday night and the place was not particularly full. We ordered and the food did not come for nearly an hour. Unfortunately our party was on out way to a concert and needed to be in and out in a reasonable amount of time. The food just wasn't coming. I asked one waiter where our food was and he said he would check. He never gave us an update. He walked by the table a few times but didn't bother to respond. We asked another waitress and she came back a while later and told us our food would be out in 7 minutes. I thought I heard wrong. I thought she said several, but she said 7. This is after we had been waiting for 45 minute. The food didn't come for about another 15 minutes. The food was fine, as usual, an hour after we ordered. We got the bill and it included gratuity. I told the waitress that the service was awful but she said she couldn't change the added gratuity. I told her I had come to the restaurant before but I would never come back.I can understand if a place has a bad night and is understaffed and over booked. That didn't seem to be the problem. The problem was that the staff is completely clueless with respect to customer service. If the food is taking a while, the staff should be extra attentive - fill the water glasses, give updates - not ignore, not respond to requests and then try and settle up as if there was nothing wrong. The complete lack of acknowledgment of the problem was infuriating."
74,"The service sucks....The staff have no personality whatsoever and it would be fine if they were good at their job. Nope...they suck at that too...You wait forever to get anything...including water. And don't dare and ask for anything...like salsa. You'll never get it...The food is nasty...I've made better food and I suck at cooking. I forgot what I order but it was beef and shrimp. The beef tasted like the cow died 8 years ago and was dry like it was cooked 7 years ago. The refried beans looked like diarrhea....and the casamiento....no comment. Okay, 1 comment...it tasted like shit. The BF order the tiger shrimp plate....he came in starving and left starving.I'll say it again....this place just sucked.......So not worth the time or money...what a disappointment."
75,i went there in the late afternoon and the place was empty.  service was great.  had the shrimp dish and was shocked how overcooked the shrimp were.  i liked the salad dressing.  red re-fried beans tasted bland and 'waxy'.  a little pricey for the quality of the food.  probably wouldn't go back.
76,"While the food here is decent the service is the worst I've encountered in the Bay Area in a long time. It took them 45 mins to serve us the other night. We'd told them we had a show to catch too. Something clearly went wrong in the kitchen. And I can usually be patient, but the staff handled it in the worst possible way. They ignored us. They didn't bother to refill any of our drinks, nor did they apologize, or even really speak to us. The bill came and they'd even tacked on a service charge for a large party.  When we protested, the waitress (who hadn't made an appearance since taking our order an hour earlier) said she would ask the manager. We never saw her again. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Avoid."
77,"Judging from the forkful of food I took from my friend's plate and from the appetizers we ordered, the food here is ok, if not good. But since I never even got to taste the food I ordered, I will have to rate this place based on the service. Two friends and I had dinner here, and we each ordered an entree and pupusas to share as appetizers. The pupusas came after a long-ish wait, followed almost immediately by my two friends' entrees. At that point, I was still happily munching on the pupusas, so my friends started digging in to their plates even though mine hadn't arrived. After about 20 minutes, I still hadn't gotten my food. I asked the server about it, and she ducked back to the kitchen. After another 15 minutes, my food had still not arrived and my friends were done with theirs, so I just cancelled my order. What's worse was the completely unapologetic attitude I got from the staff. Seriously...I didn't even get a ""sorry,"" or even an embarassed look. In fact, when I asked about my order (which was obviously forgotten), the server mumbled something about how the kitchen staff was ""still working on the cream sauce"" (I ordered a zucchini and cream sauce dish). I was sympathetic to the staff at first, but the complete lack of regard or apology really pissed me off. I don't mind longish waits, but not having your food arrive pretty much ruins an entire (non)dinner, doesn't it?"
78,"There are many options for delicious Salvadorean food in the Bay Area. However, this place is not one of them. I grew up in San Francisco and was lucky enough to have good pupusas at least  couple of times a year. Some of my favorite dishes include Pan con pavo, casamiento (mixed beans and rice) platanos, and to drink a hot cup of atol de elote or a cold glass of tamarindo. Platanos restuarant serves all of these dishes, but I truly recommend going somewhere else to get them. Lastly the service is just not that great.First, it is over priced. Second, the quality of the food is not great. I was good when then first opened but now it just tastes very oily. Especially the casamiento.  The pupusas are decent, but again over priced for the size. You can get a bigger pupusa for less on Mission st. in San Francisco. El Zocalo, El Paisa. For good casamiento I reccomend the Red Cafe on 25th and Mission. During my last visit to this restaurant I was very disappointed.   My friend and I wanted to get something quick to eat. We decided pupusas because they're pretty filling. We were the first to arrive for diner that day. We sat down,ordered about 5 minutes later but stayed for almost an hour and a 1/2. The server kept taking for ever with our check. We only ordered 3 pupusas and 2 atol de elote drinks and 1 order of casamiento. The pupusas came in an adequate amount of time, but the atol took almost 30 minutes, even though we made sure to ask if they had some before ordering it. I have made this drink at home and I know it can take a while, that's why when he said ""yes we have some"" we thought he meant, already made. It took so long that my friend just ended up asking for a soda so she could wash down the pupusa. I don't think either of us will go back. By the time we left, the restuarant was full. I really wanted to tell people to run the other way."
79,Have been wanting to try this place for awhile and heard some good things about it.  Went in not extremely hungry but wanting a light snack for lunch and thought the 2$ appetizers sounded good.  Continued to read the menu and found out that dining in I had to spend at least $7. I thought this was ridiculous! Is the place that desperate for money that they put a minimum on orders? I was so off put that I just got up and left. I doubt I'll be back.
80,"Went here on a slow Saturday night -- the restaurant was half full with mostly families. They took our drink orders in about 5 minutes, we got sangria. Then we waited for them to come back and take our orders. And waited. And waited. Twenty minutes later after trying to stare down the waiters and not getting a single one, we told them we were leaving because of the wait. No apology, no trying to win us over. Someone just said OK and handed us our check. This was our first time to ever walk out of a restaurant. Also it smelt pee-smelling inside."
81,"came in for dinner because we had accidentally driven past plearn.  had an ""eh"" dinner with generic tasting chicken (though the casamiento side was well seasoned).  the pupusas were pretty tasty as well as the cabbage condiment that's served as an accompaniment.also ordered a pitcher of sangria, which tasted a bit odd that night to everyone in our party... it was likely an off night for platano since prior reviews rave about their sangria.the air had a strange chemical quality to it...maybe this is what affected my interpretation of the food that night.glad to try a new restaurant on university ave but probably will not return."
82,"i thought the pupusas here small, but pretty tasty.  i'm giving this place two stars for the shitty service.  i was with a party of 12ish people and we were the only people in the place w/ the exception of 2 other very small parties.  All the food came out at different times (there was at least a 10 minute lapse between the first person served and the last person served) and they NEVER checked to see if we needed anything (like water).  Also, because they were so poor in bringing out food together, about 30 minutes into the meal, the waitress came out w/ another plate of food and we couldn't figure out who ordered it.  One person in my party had to leave early and the waitress insisted the dish was ordered by the person who left.  When we told her it definitely wasn't his order and it didn't belong to anyone at our table, she got upset and grabbed her notepad to double check.  What do you know?  It belonged to the table next to us!  Also the plantains are like 6-7 bucks and come out with 4 small pieces!"
