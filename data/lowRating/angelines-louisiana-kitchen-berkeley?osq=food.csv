0,"We came here on a Sunday around 3ish pm.  Super famished and looking forward to having a late lunch early type of dinner. We found parking relatively quickly and walked in and seated almost immediately. Staff was friendly. The place looked nice and cute, resembling a French/creole eatery straight out of Louisiana.  I was really looking for fried chicken and decided to go with the fried chicken breast over sweet potato yam mash and string green beans.  Unfortunately, they didn't have fried chicken with its bones and no thighs, or legs and wings which is what I was hoping to order.  Come to find out, it was just breast.  The chicken was just alright.  In fact, I felt that a really small piece of one of the breasts may have been undercooked but I went ahead and just set it aside and continued to finish my food not wanting to make anything of it.  I was hungry.We also ordered the mac n cheese side, a bowl of gumbo and my boyfriend had the chicken po boy which he said was extremely good.  I liked the gumbo and the mac n cheese was fair.  I just felt like it could all have been soooo much better. I've been to many French/creole/southern places and felt that this place wasn't what I expected it to be.  That being said, probably won't go back.  Hopefully, it was just an isolated situation and the food is amazing on other days.At any rate, I'll keep my eyes on future reviews..."
1,"I want to start off with the Positive first.  The Decor was Awesome and The Service was super. Now on to the Food.  I had the Catfish Dinner, Shrimp Po' Boy Fried Chicken, Fried Grits with Crawfish Etouffée & Red Beans with Ham-hocks. I had a Swamp Water cooler for my Drink.Fried Grits & Crawfish Étouffée:  The Fried Grits were Horrible, however the Crawfish Étouffée was incredible. Fried Chicken Dinner:  Terrible Batter.... taste more like a Cake Batter there was no Crunch at all on the Crust, however the Chicken was not dry it was juicy, but the initial bite will make you want to put it down. I suggest a better batter to fry your chicken in.Shrimp Po' Boy:  The Shrimp also had a Tempura Style Batter vs good ole Corn Meal Mix. I am a Big Fanatic of how Breads taste with a Po' Boy. This Bread was decent I would probably say add more butter and brown in more on both sides. Lastly it was Dressed nicely.Catfish Dinner:  I would say this was the only Dinner Item that I felt had some New Orleans Flavor, but barely. Very Small Pieces of fish. If I were to grade this Fish I would give them a B- I think they can make this a Knock it out of the park dish with small improvements. Red Beans: I had this for an appetizer and I will say it was ok. wished it had been served with some of that toasted Po' Boy Bread.Swamp Water:   Yeah it's Lemonade and Ice Tea....... I'd say Check the Filters on your Water.... Bad after taste. Although the Decor was awesome they need to clean a bit more... as I sat at my table there was a table next to me that the last guest had dropped pieces of chicken on the floor and it was still there... even after they wiped the table and set it..... A good Sweeper could be useful."
2,I ordered the crawfish Ettofe and it was nasty. No flavor and all the dishes look the same. No unique preparation or spice to the dishes and it seemed like it was reheated before plating. The shrimp Creole and my dish was exactly the same and one came with a lemon and mine didn't which was odd. Since it was basically the same thing  I would not go back. Bland American so called creole food
3,"Extremely long wait with ok service and delicious but overpriced soul food. Really upset about the high tax rate.Service: Subpar. Wait time is horrible.We were told there would be a 30-45 minute wait and we didn't get seated until an hour later. They also gave some weirdly specific ""your table will be ready at"" time, but we still had to wait an extra 10-15 min. Given, we were a large table of 7 without a reservation (didn't know it would be this crowded on a Tuesday night), but this wait seemed a bit excessive.What really made me angry was that I told the hostess that we were ready to order right as we were being seated (an hour wait gives you a lot of time to look at their menu) and she disappears without a trace. NO ONE TOOK OUR ORDER WHEN I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HER WE WERE READY TO ORDER. Took a bit of time trying to flag down someone else to take our order too. Food: pretty good.Not sure if it was because I was starving, but I do give credit to their food. I split their fried chicken and jambalaya with a friend and both dishes were great. Fried chicken more like chicken tenders but still crunchy. Sweet potato mash it came with was good.  Jambalaya very flavorful. Menu is not vegetarian friendly though (like 1 dish and I guess some sides). Be wary if you have any vegetarian friends who want to tag along.Ambience: rustic.It was a causal, rustic environment that I felt gave a Louisiana kitchen vibe. Lighting was dim and there were candles on every table. Romantic but kind of noisy.Price: OVERPRICED!THEY CHARGED US 10.91% IN TAXES!!! Normally tax is about 9.5%. WHAT THE HECK?I really should have checked before I paid but I wanted to get out of here.They also charged us 18% gratuity. I'm assuming it's for our larger table size. I don't know what the cutoff is before they automatically add gratuity.This place averaged about $25/person for this meal. Though the food was great, I'm not sure I would come back here due to the wait time and the price. I can definitely go elsewhere and get a great meal in half the price and wait."
4,"It's been awhile for a restaurant to leave my stomach churning and this place definitely left that mark. Like it wasn't all that bad but there was definitely some things that weren't great. My friends and I shared the hush puppies, brussel sprouts, and the Mac n cheese. Individually I got the etoufee crawfish.The hush puppies are ok, good with the butter I suppose. The brussel sprouts were delicious but heavily oiled up and the Mac n cheese was probably their best item here. It wasn't super cheesy and the bacon on it made it awesome. My etoufee was a disappointment, the middle portion was warm but the outer part of the dish was luke warm. It tasted ok but I added hot sauce. Service here was good though."
5,Food was below average not well seasoned I was expecting more of a Louisiana taste but It was very watered down atAtmosphere was great had a hard time finding parking as well I won't be back anytime soon
6,Sorry you do have great food...but your front counter help is horrible. Just left your restaurant and had refuse to seat us on a booth..restaurant had 15 customers and all the booths were open. Too bad your restaurant just lost $300  of revenue!
7,Let's start by saying the porboy shrimp was very good. But over all I feel like this place is very over rated. They don't let you pick ur side. U can't sub things out. I'm not a fan. They don't even have fries or a kid menu. Hate to say but I won't be back.
8,"I liked their food, but it was unfortunate that I found a long, thin brown hair in my salad. A waiter asked me if I wanted another salad so I asked him to bring sweet potato instead. I don't think the waiter even bothered reporting this to the manager. After all, I was not given any compliments and was charged regular price. I understand that people make mistakes but it bothered me that the waiter acted as if nothing bad happened. Given the price range of their food, they should have acted more professionally. Food itself was OK but what I remember clearly about this place is the gross hair that stuck with my folk, which really ruined a dinner with my family."
9,"The food was good, but you know that the farther away from New Orleans you go, the more it loses the authentic flavor. Just like tacos outside of Mexico. Two stars are for the dickhead waiter who put a 400 degree plate of baked mac and cheese in front of my 7 year old daughter. Yes he warned her but even ten minutes later she grabbed it and burned her hand. Another ten minutes later and it was still too hot to the touch."
10,This place is garbage. Extremely limited menu. Don't understand how you can offer fried chicken but you can't offer a fried chicken sandwich.
11,"Good food, but sometimes it lacks consistency. On a busy Friday, or weekend, a table for 2-4 would be a wait of over 40 minutes during prime time hours (6-8 PM). The first time I tried Angeline's, I fell in love with the restaurant! Cute, quaint environment, great food, and friendly staff. I've been itching to come back, but because of the inconvenient parking and sometimes hostile environment of Berkeley, we haven't paid a visit in about a year. We ordered the fried oysters as appetizer and fried chicken and crawfish etouffee for entrees. The fried oysters were so itty bitty... And for 16$ it was not worth it! The fried chicken wasn't what I remembered it to be.. Not much chicken, but lots of batter.. The bed of sweet potato mash didn't tantalize me like it did before. The green beans were straight disgusting. The beans were simply blanched, no flavor and was soggy. This was true for our side on our crawfish dish as well. I must say that the etouffee was delicious, there was lots of flavor and an abundance of crawfish. Unfortunately, due to the wait time and lack of convenience, I'd doubt we'll be back."
12,"Atmosphere: super cute Louisiana style joint with quaint decorations. Staff: with the exception of one food runner who literally threw plates on our table, the staff seemed friendly and courteous.Food: jambalaya was super salty, house salad with candied pecans and raisins was tasty, hush puppies were so-so and the BBQ plate with a variety of meats including andouille sausage, shrimp and two pork ribs was pretty tasty also.Overall for what this place is known for didn't live up to the hype."
13,"Been a very loyal customer for years.  Tonight was our first time ordering to-go.  The $16.00 gumbo was very disappointing. Literally a bowl of juice, with no sausage, and a few very small dried shrimp.  I feel ripped off.  Quality is diminishing, while prices have increased.  Very disappointed."
14,"I'm still shocked there's no Brunch menu. What's wrong with some eggs on top of your Jambalaya?  I know it's far away from the real thing, but Angeline's felt more like a place you would find in the ""French Quarter"" of Disney World."
15,"Atmosphere was very nice, service was cool but it just wasn't authentic creole food, the taste wasn't there, the red beans and rice were watery needed more flavor not salt, the roux in the GUMBO had the perfect color but tasted like gravy, the boudin was bland needed more flavor and the jambalaya tasted like tomato paste...not to my liking at all will not go back!"
16,"It's one thing if I can't bring Southern family & friends to a Southern restaurant; if I wouldn't return solo, that's different.#realtalk I had a 4-star review draft with a Yurtis Yayfield remix and smileface ffffin emojis ready to fill in with all the amazeness of what I was planning to order. I was obviously expecting to dig this place. ::shrugs::(^_^) Swamp Water (bit.ly/1KzVeyO)Try it because it sounds fun. #thatswhatshesaid(-_-) Hush Puppies (bit.ly/1AHAOnG)Sweetness not a big deal but dense.(-_v) Baby Back Ribs (bit.ly/1HHPTCI)Remember the ribology chart I gave you? (bit.ly/1eMsuJi)My rib meat ranged from ""Easily-Removed"" to ""Work-To-Get-Off"" and ""Mzafzn-ON"".Sauce was sweet, no other character. #manukahoney #broadcityPositive notes: polite service, wet-naps, fun purple alligator wall sculpture."
17,"Probably the worst southern food I've had. Also just not good food in general. There was no salt in any of the food except the jumbo shrimp. Was soooo overpriced for the quality and taste. For example, the mac n cheese you make from the box is better than the one here if not the same. I have no idea why people come here so often. The portions were big but who cares about how much food you get if it isn't worth eating."
18,"Went on a hot day. Guess what, I was hot in there too.  No AC, and was parked next to a stupidwooden divider wall that blocked us off from the world.Food is not special.  I've had a lot of southern food so I'm an expert. :/Gumbo and rice and beans was the only thing I would re-order out of the 6 dishes we ordered.The fried stuff is terrible.  Service was TERRIBLE. Waste of my hard earned $$.:("
19,"I had really high hopes for this place after reading so many great reviews.  I guess one should always walk into a restaurant not expecting everything to be as great as what you read on Yelp all the time.It was a late Sunday evening and I was driving in the Berkeley area when I found the perfect parking spot right in front of the restaurant & went inside to place a take out order with my son.  We ordered 4 different things just to try a little bit of everything.The best thing from our entire order was probably our appetizer, the cheese grits with crawfish étouffée.  It had a good mixture of flavors.The three dinner entrees consisted of the jambalaya, the fried chicken with buttermilk sauce and an order of the fried catfish and hush puppies.  Everything was really salty!  I mean I had to toss more than half of our meal because we couldn't handle the salt content and my son has a pretty high tolerance for salt.  The only things that were edible was the sweet mashed potatoes and the green beans.  The meal was not cheap so it was definitely a total waste of money.  Maybe I went on an off night?"
20,"A great big zero. We walked into a restaurant that was perhaps 25% occupied. There were as many people working as eating. We were the only party waiting for a table. And we waited ... for about 15 minutes as two employees attended to someone ordering food to go and a gift card. We were apparently not noticed by the staff as we stood there without being greeted. Finally, we got the point: our business was neither wanted nor appreciated. Adios."
21,"We are here because of the Mardi gras celebration. The only reservation we could get was at 4:30. We showed up at 4:30 and the place was almost empty! We were placed at a table almost right at the entrance. We ordered a Louisiana Bock beer and an Angelina cocktail. The cocktail is a mix of juice and soju Korean alcoholic drink. Juice + Korean alcohol = New Orleans drink? It came out more as a sweetened drink. I asked for a glass of water instead to wash down the food. The alligator appetizer tastes very much like chicken, which is what I expected. Nothing exceptional because it was deep fried. BF ordered jambalaya and I ordered catfish. Jambalaya was rice cooked in spicy brown sauce and sausage. Catfish was deep fried. Hush puppies were deep fried. Hush puppies were good though, with honey butter.We had King Cake for dessert. Seriously,  the Pauper would throw it away, and the dog will not eat it!The whole meal was utterly disappointing. I don't know why people love deep fried foods so much. We won't come back Mardi Gras or not. Don't waste your money. Or your time!"
22,"As a local Berkeley-ian, i have had meals  here. But each time I go, the service gets worst and  worst. I was craving a po-boy, mac and cheese and a bowl of gumbo to share with my partner  in crime but after being put on hold for 15 mins I gave up annoyed. I can understand being a former  hostess  and server but if you cannot even take a togo  order...maybe you need to hire more staff  or better host.I ended up going to Southie, which was amazing."
23,"I have been frequenting Angeline's for several years now, at least 7.  And last night was the first time that I had ever experienced poor service.  In fact our last visit was in December.  So here it is my daughter's eleventh birthday and she decided she wants to go to Angeline's.  There was no wait, but our server was quite dry.  He checked in with us and told us he'd be right back...but it took him 15 minutes to come back to take our order.  As I watch him attend diligently to everyone else.  When he comes to take our order, we let the Birthday girl order first.  She is very shy and soft spoken.  His body language was abrupt and he leans in really close to her, which made her uncomfortable.  So I paraphrased what she ordered and then he snaps to her...What are your sides?!Our meal came and it was delicious as expected.  The server walks by, I catch his attention to let him know that we are in need of to go containers and that we have a Birthday.  He says ok and comes back with our boxes.  Then he comes back with our beignets with a candle in it, sets the dish on the table and walks away.  Not even a happy birthday to the birthday girl, so we sang it to her and she enjoyed the treat.  All the while my blood is boiling...yes, the food is good...but not that good.  I won't return when he is on shift."
24,"Very surprised to see how busy it was considering the underwhelming service we got and the food was only OK. Never been before but was craving some Louisiana/Cajun food post NOLA trip and decided to give this place a try since the reviews were good. Busy, noisy full restaurant on a Monday evening, luckily we made reservations. Started off with the fried cheese grits with crawfish etouffee, which was the highlight of the meal, and the only reason I would even consider giving this place another try. Also got the cup of gumbo which was pretty hardy but not as flavorful compared to other ones I've tried. Mushroom Jambalaya- big portion but mostly over seasoned rice with little mushroom and no actual mushroom flavor. Not worth it.Fried Catfish- Also a decent portion, comes with hush puppies which were tasty and a small cup of potato salad which was good. Cajun Mixed Grill- Ribs were ok, had good flavor but some were kinda chewy and on the dry side. Voodoo Shrimp- good sized shrimp, cooked really well with nice flavor but nothing to rave about. The green beans were also bland and overcooked. Very average dish.Beignets- I would avoid these! Super disappointing! If you're expecting anything like the beignets from Cafe Du Monde do not order them! They were super doughy and more like puffs. All of them had air pockets inside. I don't think they were fried long enough and the powdered sugar didn't really stick to them for whatever reason. Chocolate Cayenne Cake- kind of like a warm lava cake. Nice that it's flourless for gluten-free eaters. Came with a side of lumpy housemade whipped cream ? which had a horrible texture.Not worth the price and the inconvenience of finding parking around that area. Though Angeline's does have a unique menu considering that there are not a lot of Cajun/Creole restaurants out there. It definitely didn't satisfy my cravings for the food that I had in New Orleans."
25,The food tasted fine the ambience was nice but this place is getting a one star because there was a fuckin staple in my food! It was a sharp staple so I am pretty damn lucky I didn't bite the sharp end. I appreciate them being apologetic but seriously there's nothing they could do to make up for that. Manager explained it was part of their frying basket. Then make sure you get new ones!
26,"If you like poor service then you'll like Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen. I went to Angeline's over the weekend with a small group of friends. By the time we got there, there was a 45 minute wait. My friends and I put our name in and went to grab a drink at the bar next door while we waited for Angeline's to text us that our table was ready. Once we were texted, I went over to get seated while my friends closed their bar tabs. When I arrived to be seated the person manning check-in informed me that ""incomplete parties"" could not be seated. I insisted on being seated. At this point the person at check-in said ""Sir, there's no reason to raise your voice."" Though my tone was dissatisfied I did not raise my voice. So not only I was not being seated, I was being chastised for expressing my dissatisfaction with their dismissive style of customer service. During this exchange a manager came over. She aggressively reiterated the policy that incomplete parties could not be seated, saying that it was more fair to customers this way and that if I lost our table we would be on the list to receive the next one. Luckily, the rest of my party showed up right as the manager was chastising me. She rudely seated us, making for an awful start to dinner. The food itself was good. That said, I've had as good or better creole at other, more friendly establishments in Berkeley than Angeline's.Finally, as we were trying to pay, we asked the server to split the bill evenly 4 ways. The server said it wasn't their policy to split the bill that many ways, that they could only split it 3 ways. Fortunately, he ended up splitting the bill 4 ways when we insisted.I am giving Angeline's two stars because the experience was abysmal. The staff could use a refresher on customer service."
27,"I've been meaning to try the Berkeley famous ""Angeline's"" for years now! The Yelp reviews for this place are great, and personal recommendations were all favorable. So imagine my excitement yesterday when it seemed as if the stars aligned when the two friends I was with recommended that we go to Angeline's for dinner. Not surprisingly, we had to wait for a table, even though we got there really late (around 8:30pm), but the wait wasn't too bad - about 30 minutes. (We killed time at Tupper and Reed, which was a great idea!)For my dish, I ordered the gumbo, while my group ordered hush puppies and some sort of dessert in the end. Sadly, I was disappointed in my personal order and the group orders. Now maybe it's because I've been blessed having grown up in Vallejo, where there is surprisingly a large number of people with Southern roots (ergo spoiled with home cooked gumbo, chitlin, etc. growing up and till now), but I found the dishes here very generic. First, the dessert, which probably isn't Southern to begin with, was just bland - the vanilla ice cream was not sweet, the wafer was tasteless, and the whip cream was barely there. Second, the hush puppies were just there? Again, it didn't taste like anything rather than just fillers. Finally, the gumbo was decent, BUT definitely not worth $15! I've helped friends make gumbo that tasted better than the gumbo I had here for less than $10! Further, relatively speaking, I've had better gumbo for less than $10 at other restaurants - in Alameda, Oakland, Benicia, Vallejo, Reno, etc.So yes, definitely disappointed. But maybe it was because I came into this place with very high expectations? Possibly. But I think that even if I had come into this place with no expectations, I still would have been very disappointed. This definitely was not very ""genuine"" Southern kitchen. I'll stick to my friend's mom's kitchen next time for genuine Southern food."
28,"Probably the worse waitress and service I've ever had. Came here for my anniversary and was seated at a table that was a spot for two with no space next to another party while the rest of the restaurant had open tables, I asked not to be sat there and she explained to me and my boyfriend they didn't seat parties of two at a place for four. Okay. We look over and there's three different parties of two sat at these spots for four, so then we decide to just move to one ourselves. Now it gets better, the waitress didn't even greet with her name, instead said what can I get you  rudely, we talked about leaving three different time during our meal. Finally, we're ready to order and have to flag her down while she's standing with her arms crossed at the bar not even paying attention to us or any of her tables. She comes over and asks us agin what can she get us and I asked for a substitution, her response what they couldn't substitute sides for another side... so you can sub sides that cost the same on the side menu? Hmm.. I'm paying 18 dollars for this dish! What a rip off. Obsoletely would never come here again! (The waitress was a red head with short hair)"
29,"Long story short rice plate is too salty and $4 for one coke that cost about $0.30 to buy from costco. Price of coke is not on the menu. Too pricey for Oakland prices. Also i'm sure the fish had no soap in it but it tasted like soap, probably just the seasoning. And no I'm not being sensitive to the salty ness of the rice plate. You know its too salty if you eat a dish and you feel like your going to die and your health is going down after you finish. This is not okay especially if this is your main entree. You basically sol if that happens."
30,"Uhmmmmmm, what was that about? This review is strictly on the food. I came on a Tuesday night for dinner.I've had muuuuuuch much better food for $25! Are you kidding me?! Do NOT believe the hype! Please do yourself a favor and find a restaurant where they really put SOUL into their cooking!I ordered the angelines gumbo soup and the crawfish etoufee. The soup was fulllll of salt!!!!! And that's all I was able to taste!!!!! The etoufee tasted nothing like I expected.The dish came so fast from the kitchen i wondered if they just nuked it straight from the fridge. I tasted a sprinkle of cinnamon and no other flavor but a tinge of spiciness. .completely flavorless and a waste of my precious hungry stomach! Ugghhhh what a disappointment!!! Oh and mind you the crawfish was basically frozen crawfish, obviously (!) - for a tag of $14.99.Im no foodie but i know when a chef has put loveeee into it!I wont be back, sorry! Would've thought minimally ONE of the two would've been good but they were both crap!"
31,I just found the cajun experience really over priced. There are other restaurants that will give you better food and for lower prices. definitely do not try the fried oysters was such a disaster. The most overpriced item ever. They should consider removing it from the menu.
32,"When my girl and I first walked in, the host sat us right next to a bunch of people when the place were completely not packed what so ever. Then when I asked to be seating else where she explained to us that there were reservation at the table where we wanted to sit at. Right after they told us that, they sat someone else there and the table next to where we wanted to be seated at. And I am positive that they did not have reservations. There were like four different sever who helped us. All of the servers were just standing around looking lost. They look over staff when it wasn't busy at all. We order the shrimp po boy sandwich and I also ordered the red beans and rice. When they brought us the the food, they brought me gumbo instead on my red beans and rice. And then when we got our po boy our waitress dropped half of the bread on my sandwich. Instead of bring me a new one, she only brought the half of sandwich which she dropped. Smh. I also own a restaurant and I would never do that to any customer. Never again. This place sucks.."
33,"I just felt like this place was meh. I'm not sorry we waited 1.5hours but it was just okay. I went with the buttermilk chicken which was crispy, but just warm, not hot, along with the side of green beans that were slightly cold. Another item that was with it that wasn't even that impress with that was cold . I'm sure your next thought would be why didn't you tell anyone dummy?! Well I would've but our waitress was hard to find. She would show up then disappear. My fiance's dish looked good but I'm not a shrimp person, but I tried his rice which was good but too sweet of a sauce, personal preference would be to ask for light sauce as it over took the meal, that's all you would be able to taste. My son had the muffalata, which he actually did like and enjoyed so there's that. I will say this the hostess was really nice and a!ways had a smile even when the same people she told had such and such amount of time to wait and checked it every five minutes she was still smiling after giving them the same response lolMeal was cold but still edible, maybe give it another whirl but in no big rush. Sorry fellow  Yelpers, this is a first fail for me. Maybe we caught them on a bad day."
34,"So I've been here a few times, and every single time I've left disappointed.  This seems like the kind of place that I would love.  They have the cajun/creole food that I'm borderline obsessed with, the restaurant environment (not too loud and more on the ""nicer"" side, kinda fancy-ish) I like.  I'll admit the price is a bit steep, but if the food is good and the environment is appealing, I'll pay extra.  The problem, to sum it up quickly, is that the food isn't good, and they're charging as if it were amazing.  I've gone repeatedly, been disappointed each time, and then decided to give them another try before righting a bad review.  On my last visit however, I'd had enough.  I believe it was my 4th visit, and after 4 bad visits, they deserve a bad review, and it isn't just a fluke.  On this trip, I ordered their Crawfish étouffée ($14), and it was decent at best.  I also added a side of their ""Blue Lake"" Green Beans ($6), which were basically just steamed and sprinkled with some grated Parmesan... in other words, bland as can be and definitely not worth $6.  Another side I tried was the Red Beans and Rice ($5).  Wow... new low.  Absolutely terrible.  The beans were like a soup with the rice just swimming in it.  No flavor.I'm done.  I feel VERY generous giving them 2 stars, as my real rating is a 1.5, just above a complete dump or total rip off.  I will not be back for a 5th time."
35,"- server never checked on us to see how we liked the meal (which we didn't), didn't go over menu, wouldn't refill glasses unless we flagged her over because she was too busy standing around with her arms crossed- waaay over priced ($13 for red beans and rice???)- waaay under seasoned (it's pretty bad if Cajun food is bland)- would never go back or recommend"
36,"ALK was recommended to me by a few East Bay friends.  With multiple endorsement I thought this was a no brainer.Pros:-The service was great.  Our waitress was attentive and super upbeat.  She really put in effort to make us feel comfortable and satisfied.  She even made some great suggestions.-The Hostess/Waiting system.  The night we went, it was a1.5 hr wait.  At least they give you a text when your table is ready so you can walk around and enjoy that part of Berkeley.  Even with the dozens of people asking them the same question of ""Did you forget to text me""  they just smiled and gave them an updated wait time.-The Beignets. These were light, fluffy, hollow on the middle pieces of heaven.  It looks like there is way too much powdered sugar but most of it stays in the dish so don't worry about it being overly sweet.  MUST GET!Cons:-The shrimp dishes were all overly salty.  Like salty to the point of inedible.  You would think eating it with the rice would make it better but it didn't help.  Not sure if we just got it on a bad night or if it's always super salty.  ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK!-The Ribs were meh.  I'm not a fan of ribs that are little pieces of meat and are drenched in sauce.  I felt like i was eating just the sauce it was so overwhelming.-Mac&Cheese.  This tasted like kraft mac!  No joking.  It wasn't bad per-se, but if you're going to a nice restaurant you never want the whole table to all synchronisidly (i don't think that's a word) say ""that taste like kraft""-Catfish.  The little strips were breaded in cornmeal like they should be but in tiny toddler sized strips where the batter was 50/50 to the fish.  On top of that you practically coudn't tell it was fish at all.  I might as well have eaten one of those chicken-fries things from BK (which i haven't tried but you know what I'm getting at).-The pricing.  So with drinks, Our bill came out to roughly $100 for 3 people.  You gotta remember, nobody liked their dinner.  If this whole dinner was like $60 then we would have said not bad but probably wouldn't come back.  At $100 it's an ugh and definitely won't come back.Huge disappointment from a place so well liked by friends and Yelp community alike."
37,Slightly less inspiring this time around. Crawfish étouffée was simply not good. Seemed like the rice was overcooked and the sauce was pretty bland. I picked at it hoping it would get better. It didn't. Would've been nice if my waiter or the manager had bothered to ask if I wanted something else but I guess it's my fault for ordering it. Should've checked the reviews! In New Orleans the staff would've been more attentive I think. Nice try for Berkeley but having been to the NO recently can't say I'll be back here.
38,"Hmm I really wanna give it more stars but I'm having mixed feelings. I definitely need to give it another shot. I've heard people rave about this place so the fiancé decided to have his birthday dinner here. Good thing we made reservations because it was packed. We were escorted to our seats right away and was greeted immediately. Our service was awesome and I was definitely feeling the ambiance. I just wish I felt the same way about the dishes I had. I ordered the Fried Catfish served with potato salad, tartar sauce & hushpuppies w/honey butter and I ordered a side of Mac and Cheese. I felt that the fish was too ""cormealy"" to my liking if that makes sense. It was a bit too gritty texture but the seasoning was fine. I did not like their potato salad even though I really tried eating it several times but I didn't like the amount of spiciness it had. Call me a wuss but I'm not a fan of spicy all that much especially with potato salad. Mac and cheese wasn't all that and the hushpuppies were okay. We didn't have time to wait for the pudding so we had to cancel the order and I plan on trying their Beignets next time.Like I said, I will have to come back and order something else because I REALLY wanna like this place. I tried a little bit of my friends and my fiancé's dishes and they were pretty good so I'm eager to return."
39,"I really, really wanted to like this place more. I got the Jambalaya and the Mac and Cheese, and both failed to offer a single distinctive flavor. They both just kind of were a single note. In the Jambalaya, neither the sausage nor the shrimp were particularly distinguishable, and in the Mac and Cheese, wow, just a mess. No yummy decadent cheesiness. Just kind of greasy and, yeah. It feels like another place kind of coasting on its menu and reputation. Someone needs to go into the kitchen and taste how things are, and notice that its lost its zing."
40,"When I came here, I had thoughts of home made corn bread, baby back ribs, Gumbo, and tasty fish dishes with a Cajun flare to it. Little did I know when I had ordered the Jumbalaya I would be receiving a dry glob of food in a bowl that was suppose to be a spicy creole dish. This meal was far from being appetizing and worth the money that their asking for it. Granted the portions are plentiful, the service staff was great, but the food was very disappointing especially if you had your heart set for some Creole gourmet dishes."
41,"Came here for lunch after seeing how highly rated it is. I ordered the jambalaya, it's so so so salty, to a point that I couldn't eat it! Not sure what all thee good reviews are about, maybe they got a new chef or something. But really, the plate I ordered is unacceptable!!"
42,"There were a few dishes that really hit the spot!However, -Service was average at best, and it took far too long to get a sit in a half open restaurant-Prices were too high for the small portion size-Some dishes were just completely underwhelming and didn't come out hot to the tableAll in all, worth a try, but nothing to write home about"
43,"Taste disgusting and their entrees are extremely salty, why the chef put so much salt that I could not stop drinking water"
44,Much better NOLA and CAJUN food can be found.  This is just another over-crowded Downtown Berkeley restaurant.
45,"I have eaten at Angelina's twice.  The restaurants interior had a certain Je Ne Sais Qua - romantic lighting with old fashioned stain glass lamps, the room brings to mind the Eagles music video from the song Hotel California -  mirrors on the ceiling, pink Champlain on ice, we are all ........anyway rich walls made of wood, mahagony or cherry?  polished and glowing .......the bar with the long mirror, reflecting the multicolored beams of light as they cast through the reds, yellows, greens, and blues of the various bottles of alcohol on the counter.  The tables are cozy, the wait staff (servers) are helpful and nice, and the coffee strong.  The brussel sprouts brought tears to my eyes!  Buttery with what do I taste??!!  Bacon? I had never before experienced these two food groups together that I could remember.  Delicious!  and what's the rhyme?  and nutritious?  anti oxidant? fiber? cruciferous? unfortunately the bacon negates all the other positives ( although I am no doctor )."
46,"They have twice now canceled my Postmate order without any notification,   Hour later I have to contact customer service and they say merchant is busy and canceled the order.  Either accept Postmate or don't!  Make up your mind."
47,"Meh. Nothing to write home about. Was really looking forward to it from the reviews. Plus, what Creole place doesn't have a bar??"
48,Not great; but passable;  unfortunately the cook decided to watch it up 20 notches so inediblefor us.  I wish them continued luck; some people will like eating tabasco sauce; not us.
49,"Such a sad experience.  My friend was very excited to take me there.  He has been a fan for a long time HOWEVER we had a disturbing experience and I felt the need to speak up.  Friend requested the window table next to where we were first seated.  Host told him that it did not have a server at this time so no we could not.  Then within 3 min she sat someone there...my friend(who is a black male) spoke up kindly and she said she misunderstood his request and she would see what she could do and she would get back to us.  Then by the end of our meal she had never returned to us as she said she would.  I see a pattern here..I am not only going to dismiss you once but I will do it twice...in other words...I don't see you!   I am a white female and it really upset me to experience this pattern.  I could sense his sadness but he said nothing!  It gets worse..I call and speak to the ""front of house"" Manager, Corey on 4/21.  He apologizes and says he will send my friend a note with an apology, a gift card for an entré and a dessert and he would talk to the host.  My friend said he received a copy of their menu in the mail.  So I called Corey again on 4/30 and Corey said he would mail it again and..nothing!  Dismissed 4 times by Angelina's.  I would be happy to discuss this with an Owner/Manager but I am done reaching out.  The desire to improve and the actions taken can speak volumes."
50,"*Late review from a visit back in August. Doing it now because it is still bugging me*My wife, two young kids, and I were in Berkeley for an event in the afternoon and some friends there recommended that we try Angeline's for dinner that night. We had heard great things about this place from others as well, so we decided to check it out. The 30 minute wait wasn't too bad especially since we knew this was a popular place. We were shown to our table and decided what we wanted; hush puppies, fried chicken with sweet potatoes and green beans, veggie/mushroom jambalaya, and beignets. As far as food goes, I would give this place 4 stars...everything was good except the veggie jambalaya, which tasted primarily like tomato paste. My low rating is for the service; and before you stop reading this review, know that I almost never care about service or base my opinions of a restaurant on the service. My general philosophy is that eating out is about just that...eating. However, the horrendous service we received at Angeline's this particular night was so remarkably repulsive that I had to share my thoughts. From the beginning of our visit, our waiter was inexplicably cold to my family and me and spoke to us with an air of superiority and disdain. After we told him our order and asked for an extra place setting and small dish for our 2 year old son, he looked at us smugly and we couldn't tell if he would even acknowledge our simple request. It wasn't until we asked him again that he actually brought it to us. When he brought the dishes to our table, he didn't say a word or even give a slight smile. After we finished our entrees, we waited close to 30 minutes for our beignets to come out (at this point, the kids were getting a little antsy, and so were my wife and I). Since it was an open kitchen, we saw an order of beignets sitting on the counter, which had sat there for about 10 minutes. We wondered if that was indeed our order, so my wife graciously walked over to our waiter (who was actually standing within arm's reach of the beignets, talking to another waitress) and asked him nicely if they had forgotten about our order. He looked at her with a condescending smile and said, ""Here they are"" and walked them to our table, with my wife walking in front of him. This final gesture of hubris, rudeness, and disrespect had us boiling. For the first time ever as a patron, I left no tip for the waiter, but a written note on the back of the receipt expressing our complete disgust of his service. I decided to not talk to the restaurant manager at that point and left infuriated. However, as my wife and I talked more about what a bizarre and disappointing experience we had, I called the restaurant and talked to the supervisor, who was very courteous and understanding. She immediately remembered who we were and assured me that she would talk to the employee about our comments. Ironically, I would go back to Angeline's. As I said, the food is good, and the other staff members seemed friendly from what we observed. We were just stuck with the one bad apple of an employee who must've been absent for the training session on Southern hospitality."
51,"I've been here twice now and it's the most recent experience that's prompted me to write this review.I came here for a casual date around 8 PM for dinner and we were seated at the bar, where you would expect great service since they're... well... right there. Food came out pretty slowly and the waiters/waitresses were generally very inattentive... we would ask for suggestions on the food and they would say ""oh yeah it's good"" then turn away... like what?The voodoo shrimp is a big disappointment. It tasted like Panda Express, super salty and overcooked. The baked mac and cheese tasted like the shit you get at a buffet.Overall, very disappointed and will not be returning... there's no soul in this soul food, ya feel?"
52,"This place is a complete failure. I'm from the South and know how food from my region should taste - Angelines food puddles taste nothing AT ALL, IN ANY WAY like Louisiana cuisine. In fact, you don't even need even a basic knowledge of cajun food to know that Angelines is serving dry, frozen-section/canned, flavorless mush...you just need tastebuds, I guess.I had the Shrimp Creole. The shrimp had clearly been frozen and the sauce tasted EXACTLY like Spagetti-Os sauce. I am convinced they are pouring Spagetti-Os through a colander to remove the Os, stirring in some frozen, prechopped bell peppers and thats their Creole sauce. Will a manager from Angelines please get back to me to confirm this?Wife had the Crawfish Etoufee. Tasted nothing like etoufee - rather it tasted like flour and water, but left a lingering rotten taste on the back of the palette. Angeline, you should be ashamed. Anyone who ejoys anything about this place should have their tongue removed and donated to science."
53,"This is my second trip here with the fiancee, and somehow we didn't enjoy our experience much. Ben, our server, paid more attention to getting our bill and other guests, but US. the only real ""service he did was get our orders and suggested a beer...after that, NOTHING... The food servers paid more attention to our needs. Now the food... Im not sure if a crawfish was stuck up chef's ass, but it was Hella spicy--spicier than usual... And once again, our server paid no attention to my dripping sweat... Had to hail another server to suggest how to lower the spice and ask for extra napkins.. Other than that, fiancés' shrimp creole got the same spicy treatment.. I think the kitchen crew wanted to spice up everything tonight.. We didn't enjoy the second trip. Oh well, this place dropped a couple of stars."
54,Went to this restaurant tonight was not happy with the service when I walked in to pick up my to go order maybe it sat on the floor too long that's All the flavor went the food tasted like it had a cold no flavor no flavor no flavor at all and this place came highly recommended sad
55,"I always LOVE Cajun/creole food and am so excited whenever I can find a restaurant that serves Cajun/creole food. We had high hopes for this because it had so many great reviews. BUT, we were quite disappointed by the experience. The wait staff was slow, unresponsive and downright unhappy. We waited for half an hour to sit down when they told us the empty table for four from the outset and it took them half an hour to get around to bringing us there.  Our waiter was cold and very unfriendly from the outset. I felt that I had to try hard to crack a smile on him. The prices were high for the type and quality of food that you get. They charged $3.99 for a glass of soft drink, which I think is rather outrageous for soft drink. The po-boy was not really authentic. The bread was not soft and fresh like a real Po-boy should be. The oyster had rocks/pebbles in it. For a $15 dollar Po-boy sandwich, it was sub-par. There were probably at most 3 oysters in it. We had to ask for water, which I can understand. And we also had to request for straws, because the restaurant does not give up straws unrequested. I can understand the need to conserve water and the guests should request it. But if they are charging $4 for a glass of soft drink, you would think they built in the cost for a straw into that price?The whole place had a pretentious feel to it, and the quality did not live up to the hype or the prices."
56,"Found hair in their Po'Boy Shrimp sandwich.. lost my appetite. They attributed it to the bread company, but it looked like it was prepared with the sandwich, courtesy of the kitchen, maybe? Either way, not good. I wasn't comp'd for it, just offered some beignets..not good enough. Hair pulled back, people!"
57,This place was ok.   I like the gumbo.  But the nash needed butter and brown sugar.   The chicken breast was ok.   Catfish was to soggy inside of the crispy out side.  Place is over rated used you don't know what soul food is.
58,"I came by this place and I'm not too sure what's the hype about this place... Took about 15minutes before we got called even though there were many seats open ... My girl and I ordered the cheese grits, gumbo and jambalaya. It took a while for our food to come out. The cheese grits was okay, it was tasty but not as flavorful I had better. The gumbo and jambalaya was really bad for some reason. Our jambalaya was salty and bland... The gumbo tasted a little burnt... I probably won't ever come back to this place... Hype. Pass"
59,"My experience isn't a good one. Both our orders -- Catfish  and Fried Chicken were too salty -- really not even edible; and lacked the balance of a meal. The sides of potato salad and deep fried hush puppies over-did the carbo load. Likely we ordered wrong; so my advice is, if you go, be sure to request vegetables to counterweight the big load of Salt and Fat. The deep fry batter really was so horribly over-salted, I left most of the food on my plate -- a signal in most restaurants that the food was unacceptable; but in this restaurant, the service staff made no mention; and that's a demerit, right? Because they should care enough to ask about the food they serve. Cajun and Creole food when it's cooked authentically is quite marvelously spicy and celebratory. Nothing to celebrate here, but just maybe the cook was having a bad day."
60,"I only ate here once, and that was more than enough to know I won't be coming back. First off, the host was this young, rude female. Mind you, I came there when it wasn't crowded - plenty of tables to sit at. I came inside first (my fiancé was outside locking the car doors), and I had asked the waitress to be seated; she asked if there was anyone else coming or if I am alone - I told her I had one more person. She then said in a bitchy tone, ""Well, I won't seat you until your other guest comes in."" - Umm, okay, why not? There were a bunch of tables to chose from and it was only going to be a few more seconds until my fiancé came in after me. She was just rude about it. Secondly, let me get to the other rude female who was our server. She took our drink order and took forever to bring it (again, let me reiterate that it wasn't crowded and there were really no other customers); I saw our waitress fill up our glasses but then just left it on the side to dilute with the ton of ice she put inside the cup. She was too busy dancing to the loud music playing, and laughing and playing with her coworkers. On a side note, I have no idea why there were so many servers when the place wasn't even crowded and this wasn't a weekend, nor a time close to being crowded. So, for the amount of people working there and we didn't get our drinks until we got our food didn't make any damn sense. It was really poor service. Let me not forget to add that this dumb waitress was not only dancing and being unprofessional with her fellow coworkers, but as she was taking some plates to another table before us, she ""accidentally"" stuck her finger in the food - and guess what she did? She put the plate back down and started licking her fingers and eating the food off that got on her hand. She didn't wash her hands after what she did and proceeded to pick the plate back up and smear her dirty saliva all over the plate and brought it to the table that was near us. I didn't want to eat after what I witnessed. I was extremely grossed out and very turned off by the service. Didn't leave a tip. Not going back. You're better off buying a box of Zatarain's and serving yourself."
61,I'm southern so I was excited for the chance to have some soulfood I was missing.  The staff was unfriendly and the food was horrible.  Won't be back.
62,"Not great, and still inferior to Pican and Brown Sugar Kitchen. But a definite improvement on the ribs: Spouse went for lunch with a friend, and reported the ribs were quite good this time. He found the bourbon BBQ sauce a little too sweet with honey and not enough bourbon to balance it out. But the ribs weren't fatty, yet they were tender and juicy. He liked them a lot, and said he would be willing to go back and try them again.Said the andouille wasn't bad, but wasn't hot. The fried fish was overcooked and dry. The shrimp in remoulade was so-so. He said he would come back for the ribs, but nothing else."
63,"Hmm kind of was excited to actually see a place that claims to have legit Cajun food. Boy was I mistaken. First off I'm really picky when it comes to Cajun, I grew up eating real cajun food in New Orleans. With that being said this place is not authentic.Came here with my mother for dinner we had the Jambalaya, it was bland and really salty. Also had the fried cheese grits, which was probably the only highlight of the whole meal, they were pretty solid. The server made the mistake of saying they use french bread on their po'boys, FYI they don't, so you really aren't getting the real deal when it comes to New Orleans style po'boys. I would only recommend this place for people that have truly never experienced cajun cuisine. If you have experienced it you will most likely be let down and overcharged for a mediocre dinner."
64,Service could have been better. Had to ask for water a couple of times. Waiter never came back to our table to check.Have had better soul food:Veggie Jambalaya was not good - too sour/too much sauce. Gumbo: Have had better gumbo. Hush puppy: good.
65,"Every time I come here, I'm reminded why I don't like this place. I want to love it, I love the idea of it, but every time, the whole experience just falls flat. Service was always on the slower side, even though they were never full. And worst of all the food was always very meh. Everything I've eaten here you can find elsewhere nearby only better, and cheaper. Some specifics off the top of my head:The Voo Doo shrimp dish was just the most boring thing I've ever eaten, absolutely nothing interesting or good.  The yams that came with the fried chicken were dessert level sweet. The sausage appetizer was just awkward, on top of the fact that it was very plain, it would have cost them nothing to fill the plate with arugula instead of serving an empty plate. Etc.I must add though, they do use delicious spicy whole grain mustard. Though something tells me they didn't make that themselves."
66,"This review only pertains to the three items I had.  I was going for low carbs, so I had.1. The andoille sausage.  This was nice.  Decently presented with some Zataran's style Creole Mustard, some wilted micro greens.  Nice sausage. Reasonable for the 5.99 3/52. The grilled Brussels sprouts side.  These were rather over cooked, VERY VERY oily, clearly reheated in a microwave, but quite tasty overall. However, for 5.99 you get a small side, barely big enough for one.  Come on, ingredients are not that expensive, people.  2/53. The gumbo.  I have had worse, but really this is pretty inexcusable.  It tasted of dark brown roux (flour and oil) salt and cayenne pepper.  That's it.  Try as I might, I could taste nothing else.  In the oily brown roux, there was heaped twice as much rice as necessary, exactly ONE tiny popcorn shrimp, exactly ONE tiny piece of sausage, about 6 pieces of okra.  If my gumbo tasted like this, I would throw it out and go get Popeye's.  Waaaay too much roux, way not enough of anything else.   Again, for I think 6.99 for a small cup, really, MAYBE 50-75 cents worth of ingredients.  This is just embarrassing for gumbo.  And the ""bread"" they brought with it LOOKED like French Bread, but tasted and had the texture of a bad Safeway loaf.  Again, I have had fairly GREAT New Orleans style french bread at a Bánh mì sandwich place in Oakland and throughout the Bay Area.  Why the few ""New Orleans"" restaurant's in the area can't get the same or as good bread you get with a $2.99 Vietnamese sandwich still mystifies me.A few other dishes that came out looked like they might be good...but I am not sure I will be back."
67,"Yeah the mixed reviews say it all. My husband had the crawfish étouffée-that was pretty good. I had the Cajun grill and that was just ok. Ribs were a little too sweet, sausage didn't have much flavor and the shrimp just tasted like it was topped with spicy mayo. I think if you're always in the neighborhood then it's a decent option. Although if you're driving from the South Bay like we did, I'm sure there are better places."
68,"We do NOT recommend this place! Fried, fried and more FRIED food- went home and threw up. I am puzzled by all the raving reviews- we have traveled and eaten all over the world, and felt like this was a greasy spoon diner. The hush puppies are ruined because they are fried in such a thick, hard, almost burnt coating, that you can barely taste the cornbread inside- in fact, there is way more fried coating then the actual corn bread. Fried Catfish was tasty, but again- so overly breaded and coated and fried, it takes away from the fish underneath it all. Jambalaya was tasty, although stingy on the meat, heavy on the rice. Honestly, our stomachs hurt after leaving. FINALLY- the service was really bad- our server was a gentleman (older guy, dark hair, average to short height) who pretty much threw the menus at us, never smiled or greeted us, and had an all-around crappy attitude. Opposite of attentive- never checked on us once. Never brought us our drinks, gave us the wrong bill, and acted like he could care less whether we enjoyed our meal. We will NEVER return here. But maybe it's because we are used to fresh, healthy quality food."
69,"The typical West Coast version of something.If you're not going to prepare Louisiana food correctly than just go make a California salad and sit the fuck down.This place is the typical, ""hurry up and wait"" Bay Area establishment.  It's loud inside.  Do not come thinking you're going to enjoy a meal with quiet ambiance. It felt like a bar that allowed children. Again, typical Bay Area establishment without a solid identity - trying too hard. We came for the jambalaya - it left a lot to be desired.  Jambalaya at the greasy spoon Buttercup Kitchen in downtown Oakland was much tastier. The hush-puppies were dry.  We found more enjoyment reading about the origins of hush-puppies than eating hush-puppies.  It was doubly disappointing because my friend is Italian and was trying hush-puppies for the first time.  He did enjoy trying three different beers.  The cat-fish looked like chicken strips from the Popeye's fast food place.  Who prepares red beans and rice without mixing them together.  The beans and rice arrived and all I saw was white rice.  That was my first clue that something was not right. Our waitress was friendly, timely and smiled each time she returned to the table.  She made the experience better, thus 2 stars.  Nope Angeline's - you're a weak link in the restaurant system."
70,"Worst food ever.Waitresses are nice, the restaurant is nice too but the food...We had a bowl of combo and a Fried Catfish + Side sweet potatoes. The way it look is not appetizing at all: greyish crumbs filled with a slurry of fish. Hush puppies app looks like sweet falafel with so savour... The combo doesn't has any interest with pieces of cheap sausages...I have no satisfaction to criticize but if you like food,it is really a place to avoid in terms a food quality. you better avoid this ""restaurant"". I am sure a canteen will do better."
71,"Happy Birthday To Me.....NOT.I rated this as a (2) because I only had ONE dining experience here and the Oysters were actually Good.I can't rate it any higher without trying, the remainder of the Menu.I am suspecting that this is should be a ""Fried Food"" restaurant and the other dishes are there for show, for Theme.This place reminded me of the TOURIST spots in New Orleans. ""Sketchy"".Food cooked for those that don't actually know what the Food should be ""As"".Okay you say....They have creative License to cook as they please. And if the Food is tasteful and doesn't 'Kill"" you Then you are Lucky. But I say, would I call a Cow a Pig? Nope.Located in a International Community, Diners going there, don't realize what the food is suppose to actually taste or look like. Even on a WIDE range of preparing Creole Food. (People cook Creole/Cajun differently).(I hate to think that the Owners serve this at home).I don't want to get down deep into ruining a reputation. But the hype on ""Check Please"" is over-rated. I say this because....If I order Gumbo, I expect Gumbo and not Red Beans and Rice with crumbs of Sausage and 31 count Shrimp Meat. I explain to the Waiter that I ordered Gumbo. He says to Me. ""It's Gumbo, see the Okra right there"". So I put on my Glasses. There it was ONE Small okra. Wallowing in thick Red Bean Sauce.My dining partner ordered the Jambalaya. Once again, it's in the ""interpretation"". After He was wrongfully delivered (alleged) Gumbo, it was corrected. He had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the (alleged) Jambalaya. SMH....Folks I won the Jambalaya contest at the San Mateo County Fair. I know Jambalaya. I am from the South. etc etc The Two dishes had clumps of heavy spots of spice. Not well mixed.Folks what he was served was NOT Jambalaya. At best it was laced with Spice's from India and it had shredded beef. It was a 'HASH""! It would suit (possibly) a Military chow time.NOTE:I waited my turn in registering. Instead the hostess looked passed me towards the younger lady's behind me. Did she make a judgement call? (strike one) and  I was told that it would be 25-30 minutes. Quickly the elder couple was seated after 8 minutes. Then the young girls. My dinner partner came after parking his SUV. I guess this turned the tides. We were seated. Berkeley is International because of the University. I would hate to think that there is some slight being initiated by the hostess. I note (this) that the restaurant was very well diverse.Not to confuse the hostess with the Wait staff. They were very pleasant as was the  Manager with the Long Braids."
72,"Food was great. Greatly recommend this place for the ambiance.However, my experience was ruined by the fact they sat us right next to a couple. Felt like we were sharing a table. Literally 15 cm next to the adjacent table."
73,"The hubs and I had friends over from the City. Its hard enough convincing San Franciscans its a bridge rather than a border.  We wanted to show Berkeley's contribution to the Bay's foodie culture, and reviews of Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen were promising.  Numerous walks past the window reveal a heady atmosphere bustling with an infectious ""Southern charm,"" while the website boasts ""the classic dishes invented in the Big Easy's greatest kitchens."" Unfortunately the quality of the food struggled to bear so much weight. Its 6:15 PM on a Tuesday; the restaurant appears weekend-busy. There is a wait, so we order drinks at the door.  A short 15 minutes later we're seated at 6:30.  After a longish wait our server comes to take our appetizer order. From the ample menu we select the  oysters Bordelaise, hush puppies, and at the server's  suggestion, fried alligator. After about 20 minutes our first order meanders out of the kitchen. The oysters are a bit pungent but not overly so. The hush puppies are are perfectly cooked and the aligator is well seasoned. In all the apps are the high point of the meal. We placed our food order at arounf 7. Our first choice, the crawfish etouffee, was sold out, so we ordered the srimp creole and a side of sautéed brussels sprouts w/sage-garlic brown butter; fried catfish; and voo doo shrimp with a side of  blue lake geen beans w/ cherry tomatoes.  Our food came at 7:45, a long time for food to clear the kitchen. This proves the theme of the evening. A lot of tables are waiting rather than eating, suggesting that the restaurant has more tables than the kitchen can accommodate.  The fried catfish was perfectly cooked, though a bit of pepper in the breading would be welcome; the potato salad and blue lakes were unremarkable.  The shrimp creole lacked texture and flavor.  And what should have been savory opted for sugar as its base. The Voo Doo shrimp was quite good, though the accompanying rice was bland and greasy, so sopped in oil it ruined the dish. This theme carried to the brussels, so completely dredged in butter they were inedible.  These we sent back. So why this critique in the face of so many positive reviews?  Angeline's Louisana Kitchen is after all a long standing Berkeley institution, and Its this status that allows unremarkable food to continue coming out of the kitchen unchallenged. But at $145, dinner for four plus drinks (after sending food back) is not inexpensive. If one is going to spend this money, the food should warrant the bill."
74,"The place has a really odd and foul odor when u walk in.  We almost left because of it.  Kind of like funky gym underwear, like moldy cheese or rotting meat or a dead animal that is stuck in ur crawl space all winter and you don realize it until u turn in the heat.The food was ok, overpriced"
75,"Restaurant was pretty busy at 8:30 pm, which is always a good sign, I was happy about that as this was my first visit.  Anticipation eating at a New Orleans style kitchen was building, since I really haven't found a restaurant close to dining in NOLA, not sure if you can get as close but I was pretty excited.  Menu looked great, prices reasonable, atmosphere very comfortable!  Started with the country ranch salad it was good, my entree I ordered the voodoo shrimp, comes over rice with green beans.  I have dietary restriction so I'm unable to eat grains.  I asked my waitress to minus the rice and if I could have more green beans, she kindly took our orders.  When the waitress served my dinner, she told me her Manager was upset and shouldn't have given me more green beans but will this time.  I believe the Managers comments was meant for the waitress for any future orders, I would not have told the customer.  I could have easily paid extra for green beans and maybe that is the approach the restaurant should take next time, give the option to the customer. My husband ordered the same dinner and I really didn't get much more green beans.   The shrimp was okay nothing spectacular and definitely not like ""BBQ"" shrimp from NOLA.  With the comment made, I really don't think I would return...I could have given them another chance, but if you do not provide options for customers who have dietary restrictions, it's definitely a NO!"
76,"After hearing such great things about this place, I wanted to try it. A buddy and I went there and the place was packed! We stood at the front waiting to put our name down, while the ""hostess"" did everything she could to avoid eye contact with my friend and I whole she sat others that were waiting. Being in the customer service industry for 10+ years, I know it takes eye contact and simple words like ""I'll be with you 2 in just a moment."" We got none of that. After about 10 minutes of waiting, she finally greeted us by saying ""2?"". We said yes, gave her our name and she said it would be a 40 minute wait. No worries, we left and went up the street and had a meal at a slider place down the street. Dropped about 80 bucks there. If she had been courteous, they would have had our business. Next time, i guess. This was thursday at around 7pm the 8th of April."
77,"Who told you this was Louisiana cooking? You better slap yourself and get real! This place was blah blah bland! We placed an order of a few appetizers just to sample the menu first; Hush Puppies, Grilled Andouille, and a cup of Gumbo.If that is what you guys are selling as gumbo, please stop and ask for help. The shrimp tasted like that over sized frozen bag of shrimp you buy in the grocery store, there was too much ocra, not a lick of crab, and entirely too much rice. The hush puppies were alright, as was the Andouille. You can't really go wrong with Andouille, even Trader Joe's has a decent Andouille sausage. The only part of this meal that is worth returning for was the Purple Haze Abita Beer.Oh and for a New Orleans restaurant, please hire some people of color. They are in abundance.Will not be returning."
78,"Food was not great.  We had a party of 5, order mostly the fish and chicken."
79,"Stopped in on a Sunday evening with my wife and a friend. We arrived at around 5pm without a reservation and there was already a 30 min wait. I thought that was a good sign! They checked us in and we went over to Jupiter to have a beer while we waited for our table.  30 mins later I received a text and we were promptly seated. Now is where it goes downhill.This was our first time eating at Angeline's and we wanted to try mostly traditional Cajun dishes. We ordered a bowl of the red beans and rice, a bowl gumbo, and the hush puppies to start. The red beans and rice and the gumbo were mediocre. The flavor was ok but the consistency was too soupy. The hush puppies were dense and flavorless. It didn't help that the honey butter they were served with was frozen solid.I wish I could say the entrees were an improvement but I'd be lying to you. I ordered the fried ""chicken"". What I was served was heavily battered chicken tenders, wilted green beans, and a sweet potato purée that reminded me of Gerbers baby food. I take some responsibility here as the menu does spell out the dish is boneless chicken breast. It was still bad though. Maybe I just needed some BBQ sauce for my tenders.My friend ordered the jambalaya. This was the most disappointing dish of the night. It was very dry and tasted like tomato paste and Cajun seasoning. That's it. I couldn't find any meat. Sadly, this jambalaya was barely edible. I've made this dish many times at home using a Food Network recipe and it is way better than what we were served.My wife ordered the shrimp creole and it wasn't half bad. The shrimp were swimming in a spicy one-dimensional tomato sauce. Reminded me of shrimp ""fra diavlo"" over Uncle Bens rice. At least it was edible.The meal ran us $80 and we left feeling let down. I'm giving an extra star as the wait staff was friendly and professional. I won't  be coming back anytime soon. Hutch in Oakland has much better food. Angeline's is  better left to the college kids and their clueless parents."
80,"Did they sell their soul to the devil for this location, because the food lacked any spirit or spice that would be associated with Louisiana's soulful cooking. This is the Berkeley adaption of what they think Louisiana food should be like.   Gumbo? Salty and gooey rice with over cooked shrimp.  I had better samples from the frozen food aisle at Cost Co. My friend had the fried chicken, it was meh.  For the price I would expect the food to be better then a fried chicken place where the Colonel is the mascot.If you want some flavor, do yourself a favor and hit up a nice restaurant down the street.  Or cook up something at home."
81,"Place is waaaaay too overhyped. I was expecting some bombass portions and bombass tasting chicken. What I got, was 4 small pieces of fried chicken. Sure, it was seasoned, but it did not have an amazing flavor as the other reviews here stated. The vanilla-ginger mashed sweet potatoes were also not tasty...sweet, but the ginger just gave it an awful taste. And I am not sure whether to ding for this or not, but I wasn't even finished with the green beans on top of mashed sweet potatoes, yet the busboy decided to take my plate away. I guess he knew the sweet potatoes below the green beans were gross and decided to do me a favor.Also ordered the baby-back ribs. Tasted more burnt than anything. I would have been more satisfied at KFC or Kinder's. The fact that I was still hungry after this was also not a good sign. Simply put, Angeline's is overrated."
82,"People like to rave about this place, but its not that special other than the fact that you can't find this type of food many places on the west coast.Full disclosure before I begin:  I haven't had the time to try everything on their menu (including some classic dishes).I tried the following:Jambalaya:  I had a good bit of someone else's mushroom jambalaya.  It was okay.  Also not sure I agree with putting mushrooms in Jambalaya.  Penne Pasta:  It was edible I guess, but pretty bland.  You can get much better at an Italian restaurant.Oyster Po-boy:  My expectations for an oyster po-boy served in California are already pretty damn low, and Angeline's didn't really do much to disprove those expectations.  A big annoyance was that they screwed up my order the first time and brought me a shrimp po-boy.  I hate shrimp po-boys.  When I finally did get the oyster po-boy I was unimpressed.  The bread was not good, slightly stale and not chewy enough.  The dressing was not what you'd find in New Orleans.  The weren't enough oysters on the sandwich.  The oysters weren't all that big, were slightly overcooked, and had mediocre breading.Ultimately I'm not overly compelled to come back here.  Maybe some of their other dishes are more redeeming, I don't know.  But from what I tried I was not at all impressed."
83,"I am very disappointed....really that many good reviews?!  overpriced and the foods had no taste.  Thought they can't screwed up the andouille, wrong was dried and salty.  Not coming back again!"
84,"I first visited this resturant after watching check please bay area and at first it was really good but the lastime few times I've gone it seems like the food is getting worse and worse. I had the crawfish dish over rice and it had an extra seasoning in it that did not belong like nutmeg or something.....where do they do that at? Only good about my visit was the strawberry lemonade, greenbeans and brussel sprouts. The waitress could have wished my daughter a happy birthday like the woman who helped her bring our desserts to the table especially since I spent over $100.00 dollars. Also I think yelp is becoming over rated because most of the 3 and 4 star resturants do not deserve the ratings especially this place even our dessert was crap!"
85,"New wait list system which Is handy and easier to organize...hush puppies = dry like deep fried chicken. It can feel a little cramped but who doesn't with a full tummy?, The ribs look much more appetizing than the hush puppies. The jumbalaya is good but it seems so plain compared to the other dishes with included sides Most notably the shrimp entreesPrice wise. Its okish, not the most appeasing feeling for your wallet. Its better than cheesecake factory's rendition of southern food at least.And of course if you have any idea what cajun food can do. Having only one bathroom per gender in the restaurant is just asking for trouble. Especially if this place becomes more popular in the future."
86,"So far....called no reservations. Thats cool but was told to come in. Did...was told the wait was 40 min. Came back after 45 min and no text....no help and still no service. Went to the bar and was asked to move. Hungry and irriitated. Still no food on a Wednesday night after an hr. They havent even sat me yet. Not. Worth. It. Oh and no one has been friendly.  Business travelers beware. Was seated after an hr...No order taken yet. Bummer, with such great reviews im left with frustration and disappointment before I even attempt to order. Side note....im a single reservation and cpls have been sat before me. Wow...wish I could bring my bf on my work trips. Not cool, not happy and honestly could care less about the food at this point. One night in Berkeley? My recommendation? Never! Come. Here!"
87,"This was my first time visiting this place since I've been living in the Bay Area. I am extremely disappointed with the results of my meal. After reading all these great reviews and being extremely hungry after a long day I was excited to try something new and was let down to the fullest. I would honestly give this place 0 stars if I could. I had the shrimp creole dish, which wasn't too bad. It was satisfying enough but when it came to the sweet potatoes that I ordered to go... That was a whole different story. Simply put, the nastiest thing I've ever put in my mouth. I'm ashamed that I spent 30 dollars on a meal I didn't enjoy. And even more ashamed that I had high hopes for this place. Do not eat here if you don't want to be disappointed."
88,"Saw all these crazy, glowing reviews and couldn't wait to try Angeline's...Then wondered why in the world, I would leave my town for this.Let's just cut to the chase:Fried Cheese Grits with CrawfishButtermilk Fried ChickenNothing was super good or flavorful. The chicken and grits were a little overdone so they weren't exactly appetizing. The crawfish seemed to be a little strange mushy paste that came with our dish. We also waited 40 minutes for our food. We waited for our table, then we waited for our food.This place just seems to be a lot of Yelp hype.Maybe it was the one time they were having a miss but at this point, I'm not sure I could pay these exorbitant prices for meh-ok food."
89,"Before ordering, I asked for a separate check, and the waiter declined to give me one. Asked why, he said it was against management policy.  I told him (politely) that this restaurant is obviously run for the benefit of management and not the customers.No water was brought to our table until we asked for it.  (Despite the drought, every restaurant I've been to here serves water unrequested.)The food was good, the atmosphere so-so: it tries to create a new Orleans atmosphere by putting what look like pieces of streetcars on the walls."
90,"I got the fried catfish and hush puppies. At first, I really liked them, but as I continued eating, I got sicker and sicker of them. Maybe I'm just not used to eating food like this, but by the end of the meal I couldn't finish my food, and I didn't feel so hot. I guess it was just way too much fried food and butter. Service was okay, but I probably won't be back because there are less expensive and better fitting options for me."
91,"Used to getting this type of food in SE TX for a way lower price point. Tasted good, but was so incredibly salty. Definitely not worth the gastrointestinal distress."
92,New Orleans cuisine??????? NOT!!!!!! The ambiance is nice and the music reminds you of Nawlins. Service was great and the food was just O.K. Oysters were good. Hush puppies were good. The etouffee was just alright. I got that because the catfish didn't come with fries. I don't have to come back because this place does not remind me of New Orleans. The menu seems limited to a default and pricier than Nawlins (of course).
93,"Ate here for the first and last time last night. I expected way better. it's a terrible representation of ""Southern"" food in my opinion. From the warm tap water to them needing to season their foods with more than salt. A pet peeve of mine is when restaurants fail to change their oil that they fry the foods in. Now on to this catfish plate,  it is one filet cut into pieces, a complete rip off."
94,"I had heard many good things about Angeline's and was looking forward to trying this place. Ordered fried chicken, ribs, jambalaya, sauteed brussels sprouts, mac and cheese, hush puppies and, on my cousin's recommendation, the strawberry lemonade, which is made fresh in-house. - Fried chicken was NOT what we expected from a southern food place. We expected pieces of chicken, like a drumstick, thigh or breast, breaded and deep fried. Instead, we got what resembled chicken strips, like the ones you can get at AT&T park, but AT&T park's chicken strips are far tastier. I was disappointed. The dish came with green beans (which were fine) and yams (too much butter). - Ribs were good. Cooked just right and decent serving. - Jambalaya was just okay, there wasn't anything special about it. It got spicier as I ate, but it wasn't good enough for us to take the leftovers home. - Brussels sprouts were good. Edges were nice and crispy and they were perfectly salted. - Mac and cheese was easily the best dish of the night, especially the crust. - Hush puppies were okay. I don't get the hype about them; it was just freshly fried cornbread. - Strawberry lemonade. I'm not sure if our server's assistant realized I had a straight line of sight to the bar. She brought out the drink and it was just...strawberry flavoring. No lemonade. She looked at me with the glass full of strawberry flavoring and said, ""Did you order a strawberry or a strawberry lemonade?"" When I said the latter, she said oh, i'm sorry, and went to get a new drink (or so I thought). Instead of mixing a new drink together, she attempted to pour just a bit of lemonade into an already-full glass--and then got stopped by our server, who handed her a freshly made glass instead. Anyway, it was too sweet. Overall, I wasn't impressed and don't think this place is worth the price. The food really can use some improvement."
95,"I was super excited about this place. My friends had been raving over it for months. We finally had time to meet up and go. it's a friday night in Berkeley. People are live, the atmosphere is killer and I'm with some good company. Oh and i'm salivating over the thought of good Creole Cuisine. Getting back to my roots. we put our names down (40min wait) so we hit a local bar.  After a drink we walked around and headed back for our reservation.The atmosphere was alive, the people were talking and the menu looked amazing. I ordered the jambalaya. my friends ordered the Fried Chicken and Sprouts. When our food came out i was very underwhelmed. Mine looked like a bowl of slop. It was greasy and mushy. There was no texture, no bits of sausage or chicken. Just a bowl of mush. The sprouts were marinating in butter. it was like they took the bowl they served it in, put 2 sticks of butter in, then topped it with Sprouts and nuked it in the microwave.  Lastly, the""fried chicken"" was BONELESS!? wtf. I could hear my ancestors turning in their graves.  Why not call the dish Chicken strips and price it as so. Better yet, put that on the kids menu and get some grownup (bone in) chicken on the menu. I've had better. 2 stars for a good attempt and great atmosphere though."
96,"To be honest, Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen is overrated. I lived in Louisiana for four years, and for me this place fails as a soul kitchen. I've dined here couple of times (because I love Cajun food) and every time this place managed to disappoint me. Hush Puppies - good but sometimes burnt.Angeline's Gumbo - very salty and taste is old.. and just NO.Buttermilk Fried Chicken: I don't know what's so special about this dish. Nothing stands out. If you are obsessed with fried chicken, then save your money and go eat your fried chicken at Gregoire.Shrimp Creole/ Voo Doo Shrimp / Etouffee: overpriced and salty. Oyster Po'Boy: GOD THIS IS THE WORST PO'BOY I EVER HAD. DO NOT EVER GET THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR $.Jambalaya/Red beans and rice: ugh.Basically: salty, overpriced. Fake. I miss Bay Leaf: yelp.com/biz/the-bay-lea… :("
97,My family and I came here for dinner. We didn't like it at all. Not sure if it was an off night but everything we ordered was so salty and over seasoned. The jambalaya was pasty (too much tomato paste) and had very little meat. Mostly rice and paste. Not saucy at all. The ribs and sausage are also too salty for us. Was just too hard to enjoy. Gumbo was ok. A lot of rice and one little piece of okra. It's just too bad. I don't think we will return. Very disappointing.
98,"I feel bad for writing this, because the service was great, and on top of things even though it was a crowded Friday night. But my food was WAY too salty, and was kind of almost cold when it got to me. I do feel that I am glad that there is a place for unique foods, but I think that it can be executed better."
99,"Food is 5 stars, but the oddest thing occurred with dealing with the waitress. I am giving the service with this waitress two stars. All the people who delivered the food were great, but the waitress taking the order was distracting and rude. When we ordered the food and asked about getting more honey butter and one more item to go, this waitress actually had an attitude while saying ""whatever you want!"". She probably was having a bad day, but seriously, part of going to your favorite restaurant is to enjoy your time there. Unfortunately, this waitress and her attitude made the experience less than enjoyable. I love this restaurant, love the food, think the manager is wonderful, but if this waitress waits on us again and has an attitude because of a bad day, I am complaining. I go here to enjoy the food, not deal with a snide waitress!"
100,My husband and I had lunch it cost $36.00 I had the Shrimp PO Boy and side of Gumbo.  The Gumbo was dark in coloring and tasted like Do Do.  I was so disappointed and I got sick.  I will never eat their Gumbo again and I'm thru with eating at Angeline'sThe Shrimp PO Boy was good but the Gumbo was disgusting!  Zero Star...
101,"As a vegetarian who came here with a group of friends, this place is very disappointing. Regardless of the cuisine, many places in Berkeley are accommodating to the different diets, but not this place! I asked to make a changes to a few dishes I was interested in, but the waitress gave me a lot of attitude about how the ""cuisine isn't geared towards vegetarians"". I would not recommend this to my vegetarian friends!"
102,"I don't get the fascination with this place.  I just tried it once, and may try it again, but my first experience was lackluster at best.  The food was ok, but certainly not good or great.  The service was HORRIBLE.  We had flag down a server just to get one water refill, got the wrong food and then had to wait almost ten minutes for them to find the right food, and had to wait 20+ minutes for the check!  I understand they were busy, and it could be an anomaly, so when I eventually get a craving for Cajun, I may try it again, but it has some redemption to do."
103,"Good food, high quality, pricey but poorly run.  Very busy with little waiting room and no express area to get pick-up items.  Also refused to substitute the potatoes out with green beans on a $20+ order, pretty weird/cheap."
104,Food is tasty but overpriced. Atmosphere is loud.
105,"I would've gave this place 4 stars were it not for the prices.  $14 for a bowl of soup?  GTFO!  The shrimp creole was very good, 4.5/5.  The gumbo was good, 4/5, but for fuck's sake get a grip.  Cajuns are not snobby with money to burn like a lot of people here in Berkeley, so they would laugh in your face if you ever tried to charge $14 for a bowl of fucking gumbo, so other than the sky high pricing, fairly authentic."
106,If I could give this place a half a star I would. The service here is horrible! The food is mediocre and not even close to authentic Louisiana cuisine. Ordered the red beans and rice and it had absolutely no flavor. The waitress dropped half of my boyfriend's Po'boy sandwich on the floor and instead of bringing him another hot and fresh sandwich she only brought him the part that she dropped on the floor! Ridiculous! I also had a side salad that was drenched in salad dressing and I couldn't even taste the salad and this was after they brought me the wrong order twice! No one refilled our drinks until I said something and our glasses were clearly empty! I would NOT recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Louisiana cuisine.
107,"this is not a louisiana kitchen... it's more of a kitchen of a third cousin who's mom was a descendant of a louisiana native. essentially, the food is unimpressive especially as a person who grew up in a household where having southern soul food happens as daily as waking up. the name is deceptive. oh ALK, lets stop with the false pretenses.   Honestly, the reason I think this restaurant is surviving is because they have figured out how to market to white people. White people have no idea what the ""jambalaya"" or ""gumbo"" should REALLY taste like, so they'll assume that a place self-proclaimed a ""LOUISIANA KITCHEN"" must know. Eh Eh. But whatever, the place isn't horrible, it's just not good and it's overpriced. If you want real southern food folks, I hate to say it, but you gotta go to the hood. lol. Try Soul's in East Oakland for taste (not service, their service gets 2 stars) if you wanna try some authentic soul food. Hell, I think Popeyes might even do a better job at capturing authentic louisiana cuisine than this place. I wonder if that last sentence makes me a hater..."
108,"As much as I wanted to like this place, the service was terrible. We ordered hush puppies and two entrees. However the hush puppies never came. It wasn't until after our entrees came that the waitress decided to check on us. We ended up canceling the hush puppies. The fried chicken entree was extremely cold so we decided to send it back. The waitress then came to our table and explained to us in an extremely condescending way how she thought the plate was extremely hot so she couldn't imagine that the food would be cold and that the sweet potatoes that came with the fried chicken never get too hot because ""they're the only thing [they] don't make fresh and [they] don't have a microwave."" The waitress never asked us if we needed a refill on our water and when she finally came to refill our waters, she poured water into my half drank lemonade glass. At the end of the meal, I has to ask for a box twice. I ended up having to ask another waiter. The food was actually pretty decent, but the waitress was rude, slow, condescending and seemed lost."
109,"Great food, but the horrible service will keep you from coming back. Don't mind if they are busy, i just want the basics, you don't even get that."
110,"I so wish I could give more stars but I rely on yelp and must be honest.  Party of 4 seated and waited on in a timely manner.  The host and servers were friendly enough and the Bignets are pretty good.....But the food was enough to say I will not be returning.  Voodoo Shrimp, definitely Voodoo!  The Marconi and cheese was Dry dry DRY.  The Brussel sprouts lost its vegi status being over cooked.  Let's just say they are a crispy treat.  Like the seaweed snacks.  The 3 shrimps on a bed of lettuce was the best, but made you mad because you only had 3. Still hungry, attacked the ribs which had to much syrup that made them extremely sticky.  Should have had the boudain sausage instead of the sauage.  Yes a plain non Louisiana sausage put off as a andouille sauage.  Oysters not fresh and if they are not fresh they most definitely need seasoning.  The best thing....Tupper and Reed Bar.....Moscow Mule saves the day.  Hope you have a better meal."
111,"Angeline's.... I REALLY wanted to love the restaurant the first time I tried you last night, but COME ON.  Here's the deal.  When I call in and place a to go order for fried chicken and ask you what type of four pieces I'll get with the entree, don't beat around the bush.  You tell me four pieces----in reality I'm ordering four fried chicken strips, with under done green beans and I guess a decent sweet potato mash.  In addition I order mac n cheese and hush puppies.  Total cost?  $29.00.  WHAT?????First of all the chicken really did have nice breading and was really juicy.  Worth the money?  NO.  The hush puppies although too big in size were good too and I'll say OK on the gravy. My five year old niece could make better mac n cheese. My biggest issue comes down to this... DO NOT DECEIVE ME!!!!!  I asked the gentleman who took my phone order specific details abut the entree and sides and was lead to believe that I was getting something tasty and substantial...NOT the case---HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.I'm from the South and know what's up when it comes to southern grub.  If the total  cost of the meal was $15-$20 I may have wrote a less scathing review, but seriously, I will never frequent Angeline's again and am thankful I didn't sit through the food experience in house.I'd suggest getting fried chicken from Quickway in Lake Merritt area rather than overspending money on sub-par food.  I really hope Angeline's can get it together..."
112,"I am from the Louisiana, and I miss all the great southern/Cajun cookin. I was going through yelp tryin to find the best restaurants for some good fried catfish....and was surprised at how hard it really is to find out here. But Angeline's looked to be a really top notch place, imagine my disappointment when the ONLY good thing about my $80 take out order was the few pieces of catfish. My kids had the fried cheese grits with crawfish etouffee, two little bitty grit sticks with maybe a spoonful of etouffee is not ok for $10! They also had the bad experience of getting the Andouille. the toughest most bland Andouille I've ever had...and a waste of money for 5 bites for $7. Now me and my husband got the catfish, and I'll say they did a good job on the catfish itself (that's why I gave them one star) but the hushpuppies were just fried sweet cornbread, not hushpuppies! If you're gonna call yourself a Louisiana kitchen, might wanna learn the difference. And the potato salad (the little 3 bites of it that we got) was just potatoes parsley and mayo...that's it. Oh we got a bowl of gumbo too.....It had rice, the brown gravy from the gumbo and one piece of okra, no shrimp, no chicken, no sausage, nothing! It had no flavor either, Cajun cuisine is a myriad of flavors with a bit of spice to make your tastebuds dance, the gumbo didn't even have salt, this experience was a sad disappointment! Oh and we ordered an extra side of mac and cheese, and it wasn't even in the order....albeit, I wasn't feeling well so I sent one of my friends to pick it up and he didn't do a once over to make sure everything was correct, but this is a restaurant and I'm sorry but they should be accountable for makin sure I get all that I paid for!Will not be going back....."
113,"I'm puzzled by all the positive reviews.  The service was mediocre at best, and the food was average.Based on all the reviews warning about long wait times for a table, we made dinner reservations.  We arrived 5 minutes early, and were told by the hostess that our table wasn't ready.  After being forced to wait another 10 minutes (5 minutes past our reservation time), the led us to a table right in front of the door.  We literally had people standing and staring at us in the waiting area the entire time we were dining.  Also, every time the door was opened we were hit with a blast of cold air.  What kind of place gives the worst table in the restaurant to people who arrived early for their reservation?Sadly, the seating situation was only the beginning of problems.  Once seated, we reviewed the menu, and waited.  And waited.  And waited before our server decided to wander over.  We placed our full order, including drinks.  Then we waited again.  We took a trip to the restroom.  Still no drinks delivered.  Finally the drinks arrived.  We then waited a while longer for our appetizer to come out.  Thankfully our food came out shortly afterwards.  There was nothing wrong with the food.  It was fine.  But it wasn't anything special either.  We ordered the Cajun Mixed Grill, Fried Chicken & Shrimp Po'Boy.  The fried chicken tasted ok, but again, nothing special.  My wife did comment that it tasted like it was cooked in really old oil (in other words, they aren't changing their fry oil out all that often).  The mixed grill was ok, but it just didn't come together.  There was one decent sized sausage, but the ribs were ridiculously small.  The Po Boy was huge, and looked pretty good overall.Once we finished eating, we played the waiting game again, as our server ignored us again.  Eventually we flagged down a busboy to refill our drinks, and to ask for the bill.  Eventually our server wandered over with the bill & refilled our drinks.  We then waited once again for someone to take the bill.  Someone (maybe it was the manager?) finally took the bill, and I watched him run my credit card.  Then instead of bringing it back to us, he actually walked in the opposite direction from our table, and handed our server the bill.  I then watched our server wander around the bar for a few minutes (all while holding my credit card), before finally bringing it back to me.  This boggles my mind.  I doubt we'll go back."
114,"Maybe I caught them on an off night. We only ordered 4 appetizers. The Mac & cheese came in 10 minutes but the grits & crawfish, baby back ribs, and gumbo took another 50 minutes... Wtf. The ribs were awesome - tender, crunchy tips, and sweet. The grits & crawfish was good, but on the salty side. The gumbo was entirely disappointing. First, they served us room-temp stew.  Then, when it came back it was still not good, even tasting like you're eating a bowl full of concentrated gravy. Like I said, maybe it was an off day but that was the worst gumbo I've ever had. We left it all on the table."
115,"Not bad food.  In fact the food is pretty good. The problem is that it is so not ""authentic Louisiana style"" or flavor.  I am from the South and have been to various parish's in Louisiana many times.  I have never , ever, ever had food as generic and bland as the food at Angeline's.  I can't say enough about the food quality, it was great.  If you don't like real southern or Louisiana flavored food (strongly flavored that is) but do like the ""idea"" of eating Louisiana style food, then Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen is for you.  It is hands down a California interpretation of what Louisiana fare might taste like.  Nice place, nice atmosphere, decent prices but not really anything close to authentic.  Don't get me started on the service....the girl at the entrance was great but the waiter was hilariously condescending and rude."
116,"I wish I could say my experience at Angeline's was as wonderful as everyone below me reviewing but it was not. I thought the food was average, minus the hush puppies  We ordered the hush puppies, gumbo, jambalaya, and the fried chicken.  The hush puppies were amazing. From 1, bad,  to 10, amazing, I would rate them at 10.  They had a great texture, the hush puppies alone had a nice flavor, and the honey-butter was wonderful and flavorful.The gumbo wasn't anything spectacular to me. The andouille sausage was  too chewy.  However, It did have a nice smokey flavor to it.The tomato flavor in the base for the jambalaya was a little too strong for me. This tasted a little chef boyardee for me.  I also think I got a stomachache from this. Lastly the Fried Chicken, I was disappointed when I have received chicken strips instead of actual chicken pieces, like a drumstick or thigh.  The green beans had a horrible frozen then defrosted and overcooked texture, which was also bland. And the sauce for the chicken did nothing for me, I found it pretty bland.  Maybe I caught Angeline's on a bad day...  One star for the serviceOne star for the hush puppies."
117,"The ribs I had last night were, on an individual level, either burned and not edible, or so tough that I couldn't enjoy them. The last time I had them, they we unbelievably tender, but there was no excuse for the meal I had last night.There service is pretty decent though, so it saves them from a one star review."
118,"Over the last few years, I've eaten at this place four times. It's usually because my party wants to eat here. Today was the LAST time I'll be back. I ordered hush puppies as an appetizer. Unfortunately, they were raw in the middle and burned to a crisp on the outside. I only had one bite before I realized the oil was too hot and old, resulting in a mushy center and an overcooked, lava encrusted outer shell. The appetizer spoiled my appetite for the remaining lunch that consisted of a Po' Boy Shrimp sandwich (shells left on the shrimp that became lodged in my throat) and a BLAND potato salad with undercooked (raw) potatoes with no seasoning. I encourage to patronize this restaurant if you have no idea what Louisiana food taste like and want to tell all your friends that you've experienced Southern food. Thank God I didn't order the Swamp Water."
119,"My friend ordered their gumbo and it was so salty, we couldn't believe it. Their fried chicken breast is average, bread crumb breaded, nothing special. I had their pasta which was mediocre. I wasn't wowed."
120,"Waited 40 minutes for a takeout order. The hostess said ""20 minutes at most,"" and later that ""The kitchen is going crazy.""Gauging from other reviews, it's always this level of slow. So i guess if you're gonna go, don't go when already hangry.My mushroom jambalaya proved to, indeed, be edible, hence the second star. But it was greasy as hell.Yeah....I need to go lie down. ~T"
121,Portions are not good and it is pricey.  Nothing tastes like what I've eatten in NO
122,"Second visit as of yesterday and I so wanted to like this place but.........I just could not. I've eaten here twice and each time was disappointed I had the crawfish etoufelle which was very tasteless and did not do it for me at all. Thought maybe I just made a wrong choice so told myself I will try it again. So yesterday we did I went here and ordered a shrimp po boy with the salad, but yet again I was disappointed. The shrimp by themselves tasted very good but I just could not get over the very strong deli mustard the put on the sandwich to me it just ruined the taste.... I've eaten at a few Cajun restaurants and never had this on a po boy most of the time it is creole sauce almost like a spicy thousand island dressing. Needless to say I won't be spending my hard earned money here..."
123,"One of my restaurant pet peeves is paying a lot of money for way too much food. Leftovers never taste as good as when they first come out of the kitchen, and half the time I end up throwing it out. On the other hand, I love it when you go to a restaurant and pay your fair share, finish your meal, and feel completely satisfied.I came to Angeline's with my wife and a couple of hungry friends and ordered the jambalaya. It wasn't much to write home about, but for fourteen bucks, it could have been better. Though there were nice chunks of chicken and sausage, it had sticky, ketchup-y texture I wasn't all too crazy about.  We also tried the bbq creole-style shrimp and the hush puppies; the sweet, buttery bbq dipping sauce was a treat, but the hush puppies were a bit too salty. Even a slather of whipped chive butter wasn't enough to save them.Service was adequate, and I was glad we didn't have to wait in line for brunch. But given alternatives (e.g. Brenda's in San Francisco) and the overall quality and variety of food in Berkeley, it's unlikely I'll be back."
124,"Locating in the central Downtown Berkeley district, you should ONLY visit this place when everyone has agreed to be there at the same time. By the same time, you are right, I do mean no 1 second more or less because the hostess was superbly trained to the headcount = table rule. With over 2K reviews on Yelp, I am only suggesting if you are looking for a place to enjoy a meal without forever cutting your friends for being 5 minutes late, there are plenty of alternatives. The bartender/waiter was very friendly and patient. Fried oyster was crispy but the batter is a little hard on my taste. Mac and Cheese was edible but so far nothing can compare to my beloved Pican so I can be bias here. First time to have gumbo of a dish in my life so there's no comparison but I think it's decent food. Overall, I respect the business model and will leave the seats for much needed parents with their kids at UCB."
125,"I liked them better before the remodel; a lot cozier, and better service (but that could be my imagination). But it is nice not having to line up forever just to get a table. Nice, classy place for dinner (good for dates!). The hush puppies are delicious. All the entrees I've tried (crawfish etouffee, shrimp creole, jambalaya) seem too salty for my liking. Probably wouldn't come too often, especially since it isn't very light on the wallet. Service is mediocre, even when the restaurant was super empty. But my main pet peeve was THE WOBBLY TABLE! If you can afford a giant remodel to double the size of your restaurant, surely you can afford non-wobbly tables. Our table was wobbly, so we moved to the next one over, but that one was wobbly too :(I hate wobbly tables. Plus the tables are tiny. They should get bigger ones, since the restaurant looks too empty compared to its cute cramped look from before."
126,"My three roommates and I came for lunch on a Saturday and shared a bunch of dishes. To be honest, nothing really stands out in my memory among the hush puppies, fried cheese grits, buttermilk fried chicken, and whatever else we ate that I might actually be forgetting. However, I do have to point out that the gumbo flavor was really strange and off-putting. I kept going back to taste more of it because I thought that my previous tastes could have been flukes, but the only thing I can think to compare the gumbo to is really salty dirt. The menu gave some history of Creole/Cajun food and stated that every family down South has their own particular recipe for gumbo, so maybe this chef's just didn't appeal to me. We got beignets and banana bread pudding. The beignets are just like donuts, so I guess the best part of the meal for me was the bread pudding--the banana element really adds another layer of decadence, and opens the door to other possible tasty renditions of bread pudding in my mind. Overall, everything simply tastes as you would expect deep-fried [insert food name here] to taste, so I suppose one's rating of Angeline's simply depends on one's oil intake threshold.Our meal totaled more than $50, but we didn't get super full from sharing numerous little items so this place is definitely on the pricey side. The desserts are ridiculously buttery and sugary and thus good, but the entrees no longer entice me. It is possible that this type of cuisine is just not my favorite, because in my opinion it's difficult to make food centered around frying and stewing really classy and worth the extra bucks."
127,"Creditable for airport food. Maybe that's harsh, but Angeline's is a slick family style restaurant masquerading as a unique Berkeley spot. Nothing was really unpleasant (except for brussels sprouts that were drowned in a viscous butter ""sauce"" that I could taste for days). The oyster po' boy was fresh, but too much cornmeal and way too much bread.Chemistry lab food isn't the worst thing in the world. But it's not the best."
128,"Quite pricey food, and the food isn't even worth it. Way too salty, even for southern food. Also, in my opinion the restaurant is too dark to see anything but the plate in front of you."
129,"We've been here 3 times. Only one of them did we actually get to eat. That's mostly due to the incompetence of the hostesses. We walk in, see several 2 tops open butl they leave them open for no reason. When we point out the open tables they say that they're saving them for 4 Tops. When I look to see what the tables next to them are doing they're just starting their entrees... This is ludicrous. The ownership expanding the dinning room floor space doesn't solve their wait problem at all. It's their dumb hostess staff that fools around on their fancy iPad seating charts that cause the real issue. To top it off, there were table seats open at the bar, we asked to sit there and she said they leave it open for people who were enjoying drinks waiting for tables and offer them up to them first. Oh, beside the service... the food is mediocre at best. Over this place."
130,Wasn't sure why this place was rated so high but I left a little disappointed. Hush puppies: Really dryFried chicken: Good but honestly not worth the $16. There are a lot of other places that are better for fried chicken near Berkeley (Oriental BBQ Chicken Town).Service was also kind of slow even though there weren't even that many people eating.
131,"Angeline's is pretty good! A little pricey for a chicken sandwich but eatable. The mac and cheese is yummy!  I was bit disappointed with the service the last time I did take out, but I'd still eat here again. Pass on the hush puppies.Update: Angeline's quality control from the kitchen is inconsistent. On my last visit the shrimp on my Po boy was served burned to a crisp! Why would you even send food like that out from the kitchen? In my opinion, if you f up food take it as a loss. Don't send that shit out hoping somebody will eat it. I'm very disappointed in that practice. The server did replace my order, but I don't like to send food back to kitchens."
132,"I was in the area & in need of a good lunch so I asked Siri what was around. Angeline's was one of the suggestions made. For the amount of food you get I would say that the pricing was fair. When I walked into this ""Louisiana Kitchen"" I was surprised that I was the only African American in the building. Other than the 2 cooks in the back. Moving on, my order included fried catfish, hushpuppies, and potato salad and some butter/spread for the hushpuppies. I also had a Strawberry Lemonade. The food was delicious!!! That is until I got home and became sick to my stomach upchucking all the food I had just eaten. Angeline's was the only thing I had eaten so far that day so I'm pretty sure me throwing up had something to do with their food. It was an ""okay"" experience, but I won't be visiting again."
133,"This was kind of a disappointment for me. I ordered gumbo. It was flavourful and smokey at first, but the amount was just too much. I could not finish half of it because it's just one tone all throughout. I probably should have ordered something else. I just wished there was variety in one dish.The service was also not so good. We couldn't sit anywhere so we were seated at the edge of the counter (where all the drinks were laid out for the bartender's use. chairs had to be dragged out)I might try again and order something that's recommended here."
134,"One word. Overpriced. Also over-hyped.Been hearing about how good this place is for so long now and always wanted to give it a try. Finally made it here to lunch one day and boy were we disappointed.Ordered:HushpuppiesBBQ Pork RibsJambalayaThe ribs were alright, can't really mess them up. But the jambalaya was so greasy that even the rice became soggy. It's sad when the highlight of the entire meal was the honey butter that came with the hushpuppies. In fact we actually asked for extra butter, but they charged for it. Service was also slow and inattentive even though lunch rush was over and the place relatively empty.Total bill at the end came up to about $40 with tip for a quick lunch. We felt totally ripped off. The only thing I would come back to try would be the beignets and hope for the best."
135,"The Strawberry Lemonade here is the bomb-diggity.  I cannot say the same for the Fried Chicken.  The chicken was dry and the batter wasn't great; the bacon-gravy sauce over the fried chicken was all that it had to save that meal from complete catastrophe.  It was also really pricey, so I felt a bit ripped off.  I wasn't too impressed by this place so unfortunately, I will not be coming back."
136,"I would have rated pre expansion Angeline's a 5, but their expansion blows. Angeline's is riding on it's former reputation when it was a funky little place with delish food. Now it's bitten off more then it can chew and if I can help it, I will not be going back. It lost it's intimate atmosphere and is now bordering on cheesy. Their food has no more love, it feels cranked out, pre-prepared and overall lack luster. Even the sweet tea tasted like lipton. IN ADDITION, they charged us like 50 cents for more honey butter with our hush puppies, I know 50 is nothing, but that's exactly why it pissed me off. Do not literally nickle and dime me! I will just a tiny bit extra for my hush puppies if when I ask for more butter the waiter doesn't have to warn me about a 50 cent surcharge. TACKY."
137,"Got invited to this place for a anniversary dinner. Their menu sounds better than the food itself. Slightly overpriced for the area. Not impressed with their food as far as taste and portion. I tried the cup of jambalaya which was lukewarm and the oysters with garlic butter. Small stainless cup which held the flavorless,yes flavorless garlic butter : ( I had to put salt in it, but still just alright. My bf ordered the fried chicken which was a breast with green beans boiled and sprinkled with a little parmesan cheese. The whipped mashed sweet potatoes is a nice compliment to the dish but was way diluted. Not rich like a sweet potato would taste. Their beignets was the highlight of the evening and the best. I would try them again for dessert, but whats the chance I'm in the area and just wanted dessert.Overall menu sounds nicer than the food, and I would probably not repeat if in the area."
138,"The food was ok nothing to write home about.  What was really horrible was the service.  We had a party of 7 so the tip was automatically added to the bill.  No problem with that if our waitress would have at least made an attempt at customer service.  She had to be asked for everything. Water, another drink and even the bill.  Once we got the bill we asked if she could separate out two people. She said no it was company policy.  She said she could use more then one card if we told her the exact total on each.  When we showed her the 4 items she would not even add them up.  Then she would not return to pick up the bill to run the cards.  We had to go to her.  The whole entire time she avoided eye contact with our table.  She ruined the experience at this restaurant and I would not recommend it to anyone"
139,I visited at the recommendation of a friend of mine who's a big foodie & I have to admit that I was disappointed. I ordered the gumbo and it didn't live up to my expectations (felt too heavy...).  and I'm a big fan of Cajun/Creole food so I've had my share of dishes.BUT I'm also willing to admit that maybe I just picked the wrong dish for my taste. I plan to revisit & give it another try. :-)
140,"I have to update my review and I am not happy about it at all.We wandered in around 4:30pm on a Thursday afternoon some time after they had re-opened with the larger seating addition.  We were unaware that they had remodeled, but were pleasantly surprised  with the walking space we now had to get to a table!  We overall liked the new addition to the place.We ordered our food, exact same as the first time: Hush Puppies, Fried Chicken, and Jambalaya. The hush puppies, with their coordinating buttery god-like spread, were still amazing.  The jambalaya was not as flavorful as the first time but still had a full body to it and so it was decent. The fried chicken was butchered like something from KFC; the bird itself was tough; the batter was not the light and fluffy batter, it was your standard, hard KFC type batter; and the sauce on the plate that you mix with the chicken and mashed potatoes had absolutely no flavor whereas before, it was a yummy semi-spicy treat. If I go back, it will only be for the hush puppies. I was very disheartened by this experience because it used to be unlike anything I had ever eaten before. Now it is every day food that I can just cook at home. :/"
141,"Let me first start off by saying I've been long time patron of Angeline's way before the new expansion. The old Angeline's hospitality, service and quality of food was 3 times better by far than the now expanded version Angeline's. So I gave Angeline's another shot recently one Sunday around brunch time. No wait and ordering was quick; shocking. I decided not to order the fried chicken as I normally always do so this time I got the catfish. It was good but dam for 4 small ass pieces of fish I could of bought my own catfish and fried it for less and would of had more fish. Should of had the chicken after all but then again I tasted my girlfriends chicken and it was not the same as I remember. NOT even crunchy or crispy;  WTF. Grrrrr... so disappointing. Anyway long story short for those that have never been to Angeline's try it out but trust me; for those of us who have had Angeline's when it was the size of a closet space; the food was so much better back then, the owner was always walking around/ between tables greeting the guest as he would come to your table and ask how is your food or make a joke to get a laugh to make you feel comforted. It's not at all like that anymore. Honestly Angeline's has lost its touch it once had. Oh and also FYI the photos don't justify the food because those pictures are from the old restaurant before the remodeled expansion."
142,"I've come in a couple times and my most recent experience has prompted me to review it.Food is good. Service is another story.Here's my experience:Came in, hostess said it was a 15-20 minute wait. Wasn't too busy of a night from what I could tell. Did not get seated until 40 minutes later. When we sat down, we also noticed that there were 2-3 other available tables for our party (only a party of two) so I don't know why we were waiting on this specific table for so long. We asked our hostess how long it takes to have the food out because we had a show to catch after dinner. She said about 20 minutes. Food came out 40 minutes later, AFTER the table beside us got their food and they sat down 10-15 minutes after us. The waiter saw we were getting pissed off since they somehow messed up our order so he gave us free dessert. Still, didn't compensate much for waiting around longer than expected to sit AND eat.The food was good, but could have been more enjoyable. I doubt I'll come back anytime soon."
143,"Can't give this place more than 3 stars...and even that is a bit of a stretch! Came here with a large group of friends and Angeline's was pretty accomidating considering our reservation went from 8 people to 10, then to 11. Service was top notch, however the food leaves a bit to be desired. First off, I will say that I consider myself to be decently versed in southern style and cajun food, being that I've spent quite a lot of time in Houston. As a comparison point, this place doesn't really hold a candle to any of the quality establishments there in Texas. First warning sign was that this place doesn't make their own sausage in house, they use aidells sausage. Then the hushpuppies appetizer came to the table, and while I understand it was traditional I was hoping it would have some more flavor than just fried cornbread. Ordered the fried catfish and the lady ordered the jambalaya. Both were a bit dissapointing, as the fried catfish basically had the entire appetizer portion of like six hushpuppies on the plate, four small thin pieces of catfish, and a potato salad. The fish while it was fried well, didn't have a lot of flavor and there honestly was more hushpuppy than fish. Yuck. The jambalaya (which three other people at the table got), was pretty poorly executed, as everyone complained it was way too salty. Nothing special about it, overly salty, with what looks like canned salsa plated along the side of the dish. The beingets we got for dessert were piled so high with powdered sugar, that I could barely tell what was underneath. As a comparison, the chain donut shop Shipley's donuts in Houston have better beingets than we had here. The dough had no chew and was just a blowout of powdered sugar."
144,"We finally parked in Berkeley, and I was ravenous. Yelp to the rescue. Right? Yelp always is one to trust. And it was 1280 or so reviews and a 4 star average. With the math on that alone, I was simply expecting some great food.But needless to say, it was Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen in Berkeley, but it was almost as like going to a French restaurant not in Paris, France, but Paris, Florida. It's not the same. And the tribute that it was looking to pay to Southern food didn't really end up being what it was meant to be.The restaurant seats small which is fine considering it's called a ""kitchen."" Host was pretty weird first of all. If you are a good host, you should be worth your weight in that you can tell 15, 30, from 20... minutes. We arrived and she wasn't able to give a quote first. My name went on the list and then 45 minutes strewn about to 25 upon checking back with her after a drink at Bec's Bar next door.A minor roadblock providing a flaw in the first impression...WHAT WE HAD:-JAMBALAYA: Maybe I'm not in tune to the Jambalaya but no flavors came out. The sauce was completely overbearing and thick that I couldn't even taste the hot sauce that I doused some of it in. If you specialize in Southern food and you can't do Jambalaya, you might consider closing up shop.-GRILLED BOUDIN: Was good, but nothing struck out from what you couldn't do with a sausage from Costco.-MAC N' CHEESE: This side, we ordered was executed well. Loved the slightly crunchy breadcrumb top and the cheese sauce was tasty.-BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN: Dinner companion had this. The chicken was dry, but the hints of seasoning crept through to pop in your mouth. The sweet potato mash was good but wasn't really harmonious with the gravy.-BEIGNETS: We also ended up having beignets to see if we could find a bright spot in a dim meal, but it couldn't save what was already lackluster. Last time I had beignets, I remember them being lighter and with no remnant of salt to the tongue.Service was great, which didn't make it a total waste. You can sum up the experience in how the sweet tea tasted: it was a little off-balance with a bad after taste. Paging Angeline back into her damn kitchen..."
145,"I don't get the hype. But I also have to say that I ain't no Cajun food expert as well so not sure if Cajun is not my style. -Hush Puppies: Blah. Hard, bland, tasteless. I just don't get it.-Fried Chicken: the only redeeming factor for me. Very soft and tender. The sauce with the chicken- meh. The sweet mash potatoes: very standard. meh.-The shrimp dish with rice. Much too salty. In fact, after I got home, I mixed another half cup of rice into the dish and it was still salty! Wow.For the price we paid- def another over hyped and over rated restaurant in my books."
146,"This is one of the most overrated places in Berkeley. Small portions sizes, overpriced, and extremely fatty food. I would skip this place."
147,I went to this restaurant on a week day evening after 8 pm.  There was only very few people in front of us and there were tables available.  The hostess made us to wait almost 30 minuets to seat us.  We have two kids under 10 years old and it was just very late.  We should have left the restaurant.  The waitress gave better customer service and she recommended their signature dishes.  The portions are small and the food was ok and the highlight was the dessert the beignets!  Unfortunately I will never return to this restaurant!!
148,"Recently, I came here again for dinner.  I had hesitation from my last visit but couldn't  remember why.  Oh yeah, the food is mediocre and is nothing like authentic food from NOLA.Boring, and flavor lacking.  I'd say the pecan pie was delish but the mac-n-cheese, boudin and gumbo were three things:  blah, BLah and BLAH.  The place is always busy so this strains the service.  However, our server and the hostess were pleasant.  We also had a reservation which they honored with on time seating and a sign on the table ""reserved"" --i did like that.  The bathrooms are clean and spacious.  The food is priced decent and the location is great."
149,"I've been coming to this restaurant regularly since they opened.  Being a native of Southern Louisiana, it's hard to find a cajun restaurant that meets my expectations.  I was born in Breaux Bridge, La, the crawfish capitol of the world.  This place usually does a great job, the gumbo is great, so is the crawfish and boudin.  Potato Salad needs alot of work.Last night was my first bad experience there.  my brother and his wife were visiting and I wanted to show them the place I had talked about so much.  To give him a small taste of home.Food was good.  But the place seemed to be off their game.  A waiter dropped a plate of fried chicken and sweet potato mash and it splattered all over our legs.  Then we ordered desert to go.  Pecan Pie and Pot de Creme.   It came in box containers, and they put it in a plastic bag and tied it closed to make it easy to carry.When we got home, 1 hour away.  We opened the bag to find the Pot de Creme was just poured into a box and not in a cup and was a mess.  The pecan pie was missing, but they gave us someone elses left over Beignets.  But we did get the little container of Chantilly creme that would have been nice with the pecan pie.I'm not shutting these guys out, I still love the place.  But maybe their rapid growth is impacting the quality control a bit.  I'm craving my pecan pie today :(Normally, I would give these guys 4 to 5 stars.  But for last nights performance, and a $200 bill.  I just don't think I got my moneys worth.  I'm giving them 2 stars and will revise after my next visit."
150,"Before I get to the food, let me speak to a matter of principle. In this economy, when businesses need to think about what their customers want and try to earn money on the production of products/services, a $10 corkage fee is completely offensive. Bringing wine to dinner only adds to our (the customers) enjoyment of the restaurants food. This is amplified by the horrendous wine menu of Angelines... which consists of items found mostly at Safeway and then marked up 100-200% retail... I really wanted to get up and leave at this point, but this was a quasi-birthday dinner so I decided to shelf my judgment until the food arrived. The food is not bad, but it isn't exactly worthy of the prices either. It is basic creole cooking, purchasing items from the grocery and making them at home easily equals similar if not better results. You can see the ""chefs"" on your way to the bathroom (which is very clean and large so really is the highlight of the entire restaurant) consisting of college age kids (ala shake and bake anyone?) So end result, a $50 dinner for 2 which was without wine and made up of food worthy of maybe a $20 price tag... one other note, this place is not quiet or ""ambient"" in any sense of the word, very small, lots of people, all very loud... another similarity this place has with fast food ""restaurants""."
151,"This'll be my second visit to Angeline's and each time, my friend and I really reaIly tried to like it, but there's always something off about the food. The first time, we both got po' boys and they came out cold and bland. We chalked it up to the restaurant being freshly opened and still ironing out kinks. I have to admit I did like their bread pudding though.This second time, the place was packed, so we were excited. I got the fried chicken plate and honestly, it was nasty. The batter was lukewarm and extremely salty. The gravy was much the same, already coagulated and again, super salty. The sweet potato hash stuff was pretty good, even if it reminded me most of baby food. Not the best bang for your sixteen bucks."
152,"Nothing to write about, really the food was ok nothing special. I been to New Orleans, I love good soul food but what connection outside the name to the soul is beyond me. The whole experience felt kind tired... The service was tired, the food on the plate felt also kind tired (yeah I know it sounds weird) but what I'm try to say it felt like the cook  just throw it on the plate without even caring, greasy beyond help."
153,"I first went there cuz had rec'd an invite from KQED. I'm allergic to chili, pepper and anything spicy hot and had to find out IF it would be possible for me to eat there. That first time IT WAS DELISH! Subsequent times have been nothing but disappointments. Last time there was a long hair in my food. So I was ""comped"" a dessert I didn't even want and couldn't eat! It had been described as lighter than chocolate mousse and turned out to be 3x as thick as mousse!Then last nite I took a friend there. Ordered the one thing I knew I COULD EAT while specifying ""No chili, No pepper and No mustard""! My shrimp Po'Boy came with mustard on it but I was so excited to be sharing the experience with my friend and being a MAJOR CODEPENDENT, focused primarily on how my friend was enjoying the experience. As I ate my sandwich I became somewhat aware of an unpleasant hotness but kept telling m'self ""this can't be!"" since it had never happened here b4! Eventually I got to a section which was really BAD! So, upon opening the sandwich in the darkness, I eventually found a glob of s'thing which looked like a slab of mustard! I checked with my dinner companion and he confirmed that I'd been very clear about not wanting several things in my dinner and they included mustard. Then he suggested I insist on the waiter repeating my order to be sure he got it! Much later, this really bothered me as it seemed to suggest the mistake was ""my fault"" for not having insisted on repeats! In the past, I've been accused of being too much trouble to be around because of my ""sensitivities"". So, this insistence on repeats struck me as setting m'self up for more condemnation and eye rolling! I decided to remove the offending section of my dinner and wait for the waiter, Franco, to find out what he thought it was. When asked, he said it looked like mustard and then asked ""but the dinner was OK wasn't it?"" To which I responded ""No!""Then he explained that he must've pushed the wrong button on my order so when he thought he'd pushed no mustard he'd pushed no mayo! When I was paying the bill, my friend tried to say he wanted to do that. Then said he'd get the tip. I said I'm not leaving a tip and he said he would. Later he left more than 20% tip on the whole order! Finally, I realized how bad I felt from the mustard and that he'd cancelled/vetoed what I felt had been a ""teachable moment"" for Franco! I would like to share with management, that because of these last two unpleasant experiences, I will no longer be visiting Angelina's nor recommending it to any one else! Thus, I'm now back down to only 3 places at which I CAN eat out!"
154,"What's all the fuss about? The bald headed waiter was surly and abrupt. The portions were unequal: one order of ribs was heaping with thick meaty ribs, the other portion with half as much meat, skinny and sparse ribs. The gravy that came with the chicken looked like vomit. The sweet potatoes were much too sweet. The potato salad was drowning in mayonnaise, and pretty much inedible. The place was noisy, and the food was overpriced for what was offered, with a scanty choice of sides. Just because they have food unique to Berkeley doesn't make them a wow! place. I've had much better for much less $$$."
155,Pretty bad - the famous beignets tasted like french fries - were probably fried in the same oil.The chicken  was in a sort of sauce which tasted and looked like ground bricks.Sorry Angeline
156,"Service in the beginning was lacking.. we were seated but no one waited on us for a bit.. AND the place was pretty empty. The crab cakes were delicious.. We split the ribs and salad. The ribs were soooo dry.. thanks to the sauce they were somewhat eatable, but we left most behind.. The salad was slathered in fig/balsamic vinagrette.. It tasted like it was slathered in jam.. Not so great!"
157,"Quite average and somewhat disappointing.We had high hopes for this place as I'm a huge fan of southern cooking and I usually love the fare they serve.Maybe it was just a bad time to come, but the food was very mediocre: overly salted and very acidic with almost every flavor muted from over cooking.The Hushpuppies with honey butter were very bland and dense, like a deep fried corn toothpaste. The honey butter added a small amount of sweetness, but you could barely taste anything; the texture was so pasty and mealy that it coated your tongue and just shut down every taste bud. There was a tiny semblance of corn, but the batter is clearly mainly flour. The only good point here was the fry job: not greasy, and crisp. The muffaletta was clearly the better of the two mains we ordered. However, the olive and pickled vegetable salsa was very sparingly applied. The entire point of this spread is to soak into the bread and soften it as it sits there. The olive salsa is what makes a muffaletta, otherwise it would be an 'italian' from subway... On that note, a meat was clearly missing from the sandwich, which usually features a trio of mortadella, capicola and salami paired against provolone. The small sliver of provolone was so underwhelming that it clearly was from a giant block of low quality cheese. The small side of potato salad was quite mealy, but otherwise passable.Unfortunately, the most bland dish of the evening was the Jambalaya, which was so over-salted and over-seasoned that it just blinded your tastebuds. It was strangely smothered in bbq sauce and pulled pork, which is a MAJOR departure from any Jambalaya I've ever seen. The rice was mushy and starting to break down into sludge. The sugar from the bbq sauce just took over the dish and combined with the tomato sauce and just over acidified the entire plate. I couldn't even taste the sausage that is supposed to be the engine of the dish.The service was unremarkable and a bit sluggish, but I will chalk it up to a busy Friday evening. The portions are a bit small for such mediocre food; nothing here was particularly satisfying."
158,"I've been back a couple times and I feel like each time the food has gotten more mediocre. The hush puppies are definitely good as are the beignets but I've yet to be impressed with anything else on the menu. On my last visit the gumbo was downright bad. I'd never had Angeline's gumbo before so I didn't know what to expect, and it really was disappointing. It seemed like nothing had any texture: squishy, non-existent okra, shrimp with no bounce, uncle ben's type rice, no chicken at all, it was just all wrong. I felt like I was eating spicy baby food.Not good eats"
159,"I was excited to try this place because I've heard it was great. I made reservations for 7:30. showed up and checked in with the hostess. Mind you, there were two hostesses working the podium so first mistake. the hostess said a table will be ready in a few minutes and to have a seat. So we did. They forgot about us and started seating walk ins until we finally went up and asked when our table would be ready and the other hostess said she didn't know we were there! First ding.  I ordered the crawfish Etoufe, my daughter ordered the Brussels sprouts and mac n cheese. my husband's order and mine came out at the same time as did my daughter's Brussels sprouts. mac n cheese was WAAY late..so the waiter comped us for it, as he should have. My rice and green beans were room temp. the beans soggy, they must make a huge batch and just keep them off to the side. The only bright spot of the whole night was the dessert. Banana's Foster bread pudding..to die for. I won't be back, that's for sure."
160,Very upset for the long wait and the lying hostess about could be seated fairly soon thingee. This 1 star goes to the bad hostess here!!!
161,"The food was ok, I ordered the shrimp po'boy. the bread was really good but the fried shrimp hit my tummy bad, No cocktails.....just wine and beer, but the service was the worse. the Asian Hostess, had a face, was not very helpful, and the cold air that comes thru the door while you trying to eat your food was over whelming, I will not go back. in fact I got my food to go cause the service was so bad."
162,"If you are from the south, and particularly if you are from Louisiana, and have had even authentic or even just passably good ""pretend Creole and/or Cajun food"" - DON'T DO IT!  Don't waste your money or a good appetite at Angeline's!  The etouffee is not etouffee!  The gumbo is a mishmash of red beans and rice and jumbo!  The ribs are overcooked.  The voodoo shrimp (which is billed as ""bar-b-q) has not a drop of bar-b-q sauce or seasoning in sight!  The hush puppies are yellow cornmeal cornbread shaped like hush puppies!  Did no one tell the chef that an essential ingredient in a southern style hush puppy is onion?  The restaurant is clean.  Service is friendly and fast.  The clientele is White, middle class, and Californian.  And these Californians obviously have no idea of what Creole or Cajun cuisine is.  They have been duped!  Try Brenda's French Soul Food Restaurant in San Francisco for the real New Orleans Creole and Cajun Soul Food Deal!!!  There is no comparison."
163,"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  It was my husband's birthday, we waited 35 minutes to be seated, another 15 and still no one came to take our order.  There were several tables with ""reserved"" signs on them the whole time we were waiting and we never saw any food come out from the kitchen.  All the servers (except for one woman) were hanging out at the kitchen and no one made any attempt to serve us.  Needless to say we walked out!  We were extremely disappointed as we had seen the review on ""Check Please Bay Area"" and were looking forward to the dining experience.  Will NOT go back.Kathy H."
164,"Being someone taht used to live in New Orleans, was looking forward to trying this place due to the reviews. Food was eh and for some reason, it took a lot time to get served. I got a house salad with a cup of gumbo, no rice. The gumbo had a nice amount of meats, etc but no flavor so ended up adding mad hot sauce to it. We also got the mixed grill which the sauces were more BBQ like than cajun style. The bf got the ribs which was also part of the mixed grill. He liked it but it was still eh. not too meaty. Our other friend got the fried chicken which he said was ok but not OMG delicious or typical cajun. We also got a order of benigets which literally took FOREVER to where they compted it because it took so long. Overall, food was meh and not worth the price we paid. I think Brenda's in SF is better"
165,"Hoping to share my love for Louisiana cooking, I was excited about visiting Angeline's. But from the very start things were not pleasant. I am always willing to wait for a table, if under an hour.  But if I give my name to the hostess and says says 15 minutes and I got back after 30 minutes and she acts like she has never seen my before I am not happy.  What struck me as strange was there were many empty tables in the place but people we asked to wait or not wait.  It seemed so random.  After being seated in proximity to the hostesses, I watched them chat and ignore customers.  They had no control over the dining room.  One in particular played with her computer most of the time while standing in the middle of the dining room.  Both women seemed to find it an imposition to seat anyone.  Moving on, I ordered hush puppies and sausages for appetizers and they arrived about 15 minutes later.  Still warm and tasty, I was happy.  After the plates being cleared, we waited 30 minutes for our food.  I admitted all three dishes were excellent.  But at no time did the waiter explain the delay or even notice us.  Bt as soon as the first person fished the busboy swooped down to take all three plates  I stopped him.  My jambalaya was spicy and filled with everything I expected.  The vegetarian jambalaya was also good.  My friend loved the amount of catfish he got as well as the potato salad.  The idea of having a dessert on top of the meal never occurred to us.  MY issue was not with the food but the flow on the floor and from the kitchen.  Will I go back? Not sure.  Maybe for takeout!"
166,make sure you go there 1-2 hours before they close . they are in hurry  to close down and they make you feel uncomfortable if you get  there even sometime before their  closing time.
167,"I was excited to try this place because my partner had good experiences here and I love Louisiana southern style cookin but I was left with a sour taste in my mouth because of the service and the quality of the food.I went in on a Saturday afternoon, the hostess was really sweet, I faltered for a moment trying to decide where to sit and she was very gracious about it. The waiter I really did not like. He took over ten minutes to come check on us, I feel like he should have come introduce himself and ask us if we had any questions or if we wanted any beverages. When he finally did come around he was not very good at explaining what the food items were ( he fumbled at describing what etouffee was) and was not very willing to be accommodating (I wanted a more substantial accompaniment to my oyster po boy and he didn't really try to work it out for me). When he was leaving to put the order in he made us repeat our drinks, he was clumsy and had a brash sense of humor that was completely lost on me. Maybe it's because he is used to a different kind of clientele or something, but he just didn't treat me the way I like to be treated at an eating establishment, repeatedly referring to us as ""guys"", and trying to be playful in a way that was just missing the mark (""May we have some water please?""  ""No, I don't think so..."").Our appetizer took Forever to get to us, I kept seeing tables near me getting their food first even though we had been seated earlier.  The hush puppies were tasty when we finally got them. It seemed that there were more staff than customers, which maybe added to my impatience.After another what seemed 300 years (slight exaggeration) our food came. Now, I love me some oysters, and po' boys is one of my favorite ways to experience them, and this was a Total let down. The oysters were overcooked and like, super crunchy and the bread to oyster ratio was not good at all (not that I wanted anymore poorly cooked oysters, but I noticed they skimped). Go to Brown Sugar Kitchen for the po boy and you'll see what I was hoping for.The etouffee was tasty, but the fried grits were a little weird. And the side salad that was served with my po boy was over dressed and wilty.Strawberry lemonade was super sweet, but it did come with re-fills. Overall I would not recommend this place, the Bay Area has SO many really amazing eateries that I would recommend over this one. I don't usually dole out really bad reviews, but it makes me mad when I pay a lot of money for something (especially food in this land of foodies!) and am disappointed. The waiter didn't ask me how my meal was even though over half the sandwhich was still on the plate, else they may have found out how dissatisfied I was and tried to remedy it. I didn't really feel comfortable expressing my distaste to my waiter, because I didn't really think he would care enough to remedy it.Those are my two sense. Trek over the bridge and go to Brenda's instead."
168,Not southern but I guess southern enough for Californians. We have been twice and food was rather bland and overpriced. I've seen enough. I will keep my southern food to the south of the map.
169,"We stopped in last night looking for something exciting and saw the great reviews on yelp, so I thought we'd give it a try.  The atmosphere was great, full house with a line out the door.  The host was very friendly and gave us an accurate estimate of the wait and a few laughs while we admired the tasteful modern meets Bourbon Street decor.  We were seated and the waiter was very friendly and made a few recommendations, and the service was great.  Honestly, the food was pretty lame.  It was what I would expect to have if I ordered the same at an amusement park.  We ordered our watiter's recommendations, the Crawfish Etouffee and the Cajun Shrimp.  The Crawfish Etouffee (recommended favorite) was okay, but he Cajun Shrimp was pretty bad.  Both plates arrived with a giant lump of pasty sauce dropped on a flat bed of rice.  Green beans with a dusting of Parmesan cheese sat awkwardly on the edge of some very boring plates.  There was nothing subtle or very interesting about the etouffee, just kind of spicy gloppy sauce over rice.My wife had the Cajun Shrimp, and honestly, I don't know how they let it out of the kitchen.  We switched plates halfway through the meal and the sauce was awful.  A tomato base that tasted like it was burnt when re-heating and then had a bunch of sugar dumped in to cover it up.  She though it tasted like bottled bbq sauce.  The shrimp was, however cooked perfectly, which made the sauce seem like even more of an insult to the plate.There were a ton of folks in there, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, so I guess it can't be all bad.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but if this is typical, I don't understand what the big deal is."
170,"I see a lot of very positive reviews for this joint. They make me question the reviewers basis for comparison. Honestly the food is worthy of 3 stars but other issues earned Angeline's only two from me. First, before the food, came the smell. My family was seated back by the hallway leading to the restrooms and the smell that pervades that corner of the restaurant (where the kitchen is also located) made the whole meal unpalatable. I've spent many years working in a restaurant and I know that bouquet all too well. Your floor drains need cleaning. The place was packed. Clearly it's a very popular spot. Take the time to get rid of that oder. I don't believe for a second that I'm the only guest to mention it. The personality of our waiter was not unlike my salad; soggy. I never saw a smile, never received a recommendation,  I really only felt like he was doing us a favor by helping us and we were lucky to have his attention. I understand your place is jumping but it's not all that. The food was not bad. The fried chicken (strips) were crunchy and flavorful,  the mac n cheese didn't stand a chance against my ravenous 7 yr old and the sweet potato mash was interesting, however,  everything was overpowered by that dirty mop water smell of nasty floor drains. For $70 we could have eaten well at our favorite sushi spot or Chow in Lafayette.  I'll not be returning to Angeline's. If you don't expect too much, this might be the place for you. Or there's always Popeye's"
171,"Way overpriced. Very mediocre food. When my friends and I  visited New York last spring, we had lunch at an amazing Southern restaurant that knocks Angeline's WAY off the charts. I went here expecting the hushpuppies to taste the way they did in New York, but was sadly disappointed. My shrimp po'boy sandwich was alright...nothing to write home about. My boyfriend ordered a jumbalaya dish priced at $14, which basically consisted of a bowl of rice, beans, and spices. Nicely themed, and good waiters/bussers. Would highly instead recommend going across the street to Tuk Tuk Thai or a few blocks up to Jupiter's."
172,"Even tho I am a vegetarian and there are fewer veggie options, I do really enjoy browsing through Angeline's menu for potential options.  And I have to say without a doubt that I will never be disappointed (food-wise).  This time around I ordered a side of parm green beans, cooked to perfection (still a little crunch, held their bright green color, with a hint of salty parm flavoring) and the fried cheesie grits.  I thought the grits could've been cheesier, but all in all they were delicate, light, and so very good!So why two stars?  Because I think service is just as important, if not more important when it comes to eating out!  I don't mean to be snobby, but I consider myself a wiz in the kitchen, and can whip up a bowl of my own green beans!  This last time around, which is what I am basing 90% of my review on, our lackadaisical server, who practiced ""optional listening"" made it very difficult for me to want to come back!  Wanting grits but not the accompanying crayfish, I asked our server if I could just have the grits.  He mentioned that he could take them off, but he could not/would not sub anything veggie, which was fine with me, I understand, so I got some extra sides!  But when the bill came and I was charged the whole $10 for two pinkie-size bites of fried grits sticks I blew a fuse!  While I understand the no sub policy (worked in a kitchen myself for a few years, I get it!) PLEASE tell me that I am about to give you $10 for something the size of one green bean that is certainly not worth $10!!  And after many attempts at trying to get his attention for the bill, for questions during the bill, and subsequently AFTER, it was pretty hopeless.  I wish I could say that it was a busy afternoon, but it really wasn't.  I have been to Angeline's many times during a busy night when it was so crowded loud you could barely hear yourself THINK, and gotten better service!  When I finally waved someone else down (seriously have no clue whether he was another server, manager, host, chef...?) and explained my problem, he reiterated that the kitchen doesn't normally sub, but that he sympathized that it wasn't explained before hand, and comped the grits.  Thank you!I will say that when you bring something up to the staff, they do act professional and promptly, although GETTING a server to grace you with their presence is a task and a half.Despite the dotty service, I doubt this will be the last time I come to Angeline, for if nothing else, I need my occasional fix of hush-puppies!"
173,"I went a few weeks ago and thought it was really bad, though it could've just been because they messed up my order and brought me a meat sandwich I really didn't want.  Might give them another try, but I'm not impressed."
174,"I've passed by this place for 5 years and finally went for lunch with a friend right when the place opened lunchtime. Our service was extremely slow. Slow to place orders, give us our bill, and pick up our bill. It's not like the place was busy, the workers were standing around at the kitchen chatting. Southern hospitality, I think not.The food was okay. I had a crawfish etouffe and my friend had the jambalaya. My crawfish was heavy and I could definitely taste the cream. I needed some hot sauce to spruce it up, a little heat and acidity wouldn't have hurt. Her food was ehh as well. The green beans were crunchy, but overly salty. I'm thinking the po boys would have been a better decision. Can't really go wrong with a sandwich.We came away from our dining experience with full stomachs, but I don't think this place really deserves all the hype it has. Perhaps this place isn't good for lunch, since I've seen this place packed with lines at night.Overall impression: food is so-so, service is super slow, maybe I'll try dinner, but it's unlikely."
175,"I ordered the fried chicken, and while it tasted good, did not live up to my expectations of southern fried chicken.  Chicken strips were more like it.  If i wanted chicken strips I'd go to popeyes.  The brussel sprouts were way over-buttered, but still edible and tasty.  Tried a similar recipe at home and it was much healthier/tastier with less butter.  The shrimp po'boy was ""uninspired.""  The sandwich was overpowered by the mustard, to the point that the hot sauce was not even tasted."
176,"Today I went to Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen, the service was slow, and the waitress was unfriendly. I ordered the baby back ribs which came with side of potato salad.  The ribs seem to be twice baked, yes they were tender but they had no substance. As a matter of fact they too tender, and seemed very fatty. I like the music but it was a too loud. Don't get me wrong, I'd go back but I wouldn't order to the baby back ribs."
177,It was alrite ! I been there its just the ambiance that's So So the food needs a little bit more practice not to authentic. I ordered three plates to be a fair judge.
178,"Glad to hear they've expanded, probably exactly what they needed. Place was crowded and wait time was long, for a Friday night dinner. We were seated by the kitchen, staff was walking past us constantly. The placed was small and lowly lit, also very loud. I remember thinking, that this food better be good and worth it. And the food was pretty good, healthy portions too. If I order from them again it will be take out, the dining experience isn't one I'd like to experience again."
179,"2.5 Stars. I've been here twice. The first time it would have been 4, 4.5 stars. But that was the midterm evaluation. The final did not go so well.I was very excited to bring my group of friends here for our mini reunion last week before spring break began. Our party was on the larger side but it was a Thursday night so there didn't seem to be that big of a problem. Service I would still have to say they do a good job of; albeit not the BEST, but better than most Berkeley joints. So yay for their service (despite the automatic 18% tipping). Ambience: nice southern-ish music, but they cycle it so you listen to some same songs over... which is alright. No biggie. Good lighting, No view (being in Berkeley and all)... the seats were fine.. could be better but didn't hurt to sit on for an extended period of time.Appetizer: Hush Puppies... pretty good.... Fried Cat Fish: didn't try that one but my friends enjoyed it fine, but it was nothing TOO great...Jambalaya was decent too.... but that's where the good stuff endsCajun Mixed Grill: Not spectacular. The potato side was not like I remembered it -- tasteless and a tad nasty to eat even. The ribs were okay... but could've been (and I know it to have been) betterShrimp Creole: WAY TOO SALTY. One of my friends ate half of it and couldn't eat more because it was just too much salt. And he usually eats A LOT, especially after not eating a big lunch... We were even told it was a ""light"" dish.. it was pretty heavy. The flavor wasn't very good either. Voodoo Shrimp: not that great either...It could've just been a glitch. But until I see a lot more positive reviews, I won't be going back or recommending this place for a while. It's very sad, especially since they did so well on my first try, but 3 dishes out of  4 ordered being not tasty is not a good omen."
180,"I love Louisiana food and was looking forward to Angeline's.  What a let-down.  We ordered hush puppies for starters and they never came.  The server brought the main course--I had a watery gumbo with really overcooked sausage and other meat in it-- and we asked about the hush puppies and the server said right away.  As we were finishing our main courses, the hush puppies came: totally overlooked, hard as golf balls and about as tasty.  The server explained that ""they had got lost in the kitchen.""Come on, that's no way to run a restaurant.  First time visit for us, last time visit,BTW the gumbo was way over-priced."
181,"My friend and I came into dinner and the host asked us if we wouldn't mind sitting at the bar.  I said that I would prefer to sit at a table and after a few minutes she directed us toward a two-top.  There is a lot on the menu to choose from.  We wanted way more than we knew we could eat, finally deciding on the mac and cheese and hush puppies to start, with the penne pasta chicken and shrimp creole for entrees.  We chose a bottle of Angeline's PN, and were informed by our server that all wines, by the glass and bottle are half off on Mondays!The mac and cheese was delicious and came out sizzling hot, the hush puppies were not a disappointment either, a must have when dining creole style.  We waited a long time between courses, over 20 minutes, and our server never came over to say anything.  Finally...My penne pasta chicken was not bad, plenty of chicken, though I wanted the sauce to be a bit thicker.  The shrimp creole was not very good.  It tasted like Ragu or Prego sauce dumped over rice.  Overall, I felt that service was lacking, appetizers were great, but the main course was bland, and we didn't even take home our leftovers."
182,"I can see where people like this place. The foods not bad. I came here craving fried chicken. Boy was I let down. If I wanted chicken strips, I would have went to popeyes or kfc. Don't get me wrong, it tasted decent, but $16 for 3 strips? C'mon now. Decent food. Price doesn't justify it tho. Left still hungry and craving fried chicken.2 fried chicken dinnersHush puppiesSaladJambalaya Mac n cheese3 drinks$90"
183,The lying hostess about the table time is quite mistaken and with reservation I still have at least 20 min wait while there were a 6 sweater table and won't let a party of 7 sit!  Absolutely rediculous! And lying about there shouln't be much wait for coming at 6. Completely lie. One star goes to all the hostess working here!
184,"Just got back from eating here and I'm sorry to say that the food wasn't good at all. Appetizer: Fried Oysters. Far too soggy and the breading was very sub par. I think I can feel them swimming in my belly right now. After the first bite, my wife and I both looked at each other and sighed. We held out hope for our entrees still.Her Entree: Fried Catfish. What ever happened to just one big piece of fried catfish? This is second place we've eaten at that has these generic little pieces of blandly breaded catfish. The potato salad was just awkward and gross like me in high school.My Entree: Baby Back Ribs. Ok. I did sort of enjoy my ribs.I had ribs at Black Bear Diner a couple months ago and they were fantastic. I thought this place would surpass that. Unfortunately not the case. The staff were all very nice and I'm sure there are a few good things on the menu, but as of right now my wife is in the bathroom as she's been for the last 10 mins and I've got a horrible stomach ache.I hate complaining. I realize that we are lucky to be able to eat at all and the staff were very friendly, but this food is just...ugh."
185,Boudin was pretty good. The rice and beans under cooked and under flavored. Nothing was overwhelmingly good. Not sure why there was such a queue.
186,"I would give 2.5 if I could, but since I can't, and since I feel the average rating too high, I'm going with 2 stars. The food is generally overpriced, and really isn't particularly good (not saying it is bad). The po-boys are definitely something to steer clear of, as they are just like the $4-5 ones you can buy anywhere in New Orleans only worse. The other menu items are better, but still overpriced. The atmosphere is pleasant, but nothing incredibly fancy. Overall it is just way overpriced food that isn't special; the only reason it has a high rating is because many of the customers haven't been to NO and thus have no frame of reference.Like: the JambalayaDislike: Po-boys, especially shrimp po-boys"
187,"Won't be going back. Although the food was good, overall due to disappointing service and a ridiculously hot and stuffy dining room; the experience was not a hit.Food: Our party was large so we ordered a lot of food and shared. The VooDoo BBQ Shrimp was good- very flavorful but after a quarter of the way into the entree, I was just enjoying the side of green beans with kosher salt sprinkled on top. Don't get me wrong, it was a great tasting dish, but there was such an overload of sauce, i was reaching for my water glass more than I liked to have.  The must taste would be the Fried Chicken. We sampled most of the appetizers, the winners were definitely the ribs. I was very very disappointed and annoyed when it came time to bring out the birthday cake. When we first arrived, I handed a birthday cake to the owner or manager to be brought out as a surprise at the end of dinner. She then asked if I had spoken with our server or person who had taken the reservation for the party. I told her I was not the person who placed the reservation but just a member of the party. She advised me of a cake slicing fee per person and I assured her it was ok and asked her to pass it along to our server. When we had finished our dinner, I asked the server if he was going to bring out the cake and he replied that NO ONE HAD TOLD HIM OR GIVEN HIM INSTRUCTION OF THIS~! And he was telling this to me loudly NEXT to the birthday boy! I basically had the SAME conversation I had with the lady at the door earlier in the night! And after he said he would go check on it, he proceeded to TAKE DESSERT ORDERS FROM EVERYONE! WTF?!? excuse me for being annoyed but isn't he supposed to bring out the cake and do the cutting BEFORE asking for further dessert orders? Then when they were lighting the cake candles, they didn't do it in the kitchen then bring it out as it was supposed to be a surprise, they were lighting at the counter in plain view of our entire table! What kind of surprise was that supposed to be? they also did not place the happy bday sign i provided on the cake nor did they serve the bday boy the first slice! Overall, the food was good, the dining room was WAY TOO HOT and our whole table was busy sweating the entire night and the service was very disappointing. If it were not for this, I might actually have planned on going back."
188,"Angeline's was...ok. The food was ok, along with the ambiance and service. We ordered the hush puppies (yummy butter), a po'boy (I can make better) and friend chicken (so hard it could cut your gums). The ambiance is just sad...decorations are limited to a single strand of beads hanging on each light. Lights which are waaay up high so I am surprised I even saw them. And the layout leaves much to be desired. You feel awkwardly close to the tables around you. Out waiter came by twice. Though the table next to us had a better waiter who was full of energy."
189,"I went for the 2nd time this past weekend with a friend that had read the rave reviews on yelp. Maybe it's that I don't know what Southern Food tastes like because I don't particularly enjoy the food here. The wait is quite long- I would highly suggest you make reservations especially if you have a group more than 2. I went Saturday for party of 2 and the wait was about 40 mins- the restaurant itself is very small but the ambiance is nice. Generally I think EVERYTHING is VERY salty! Food I have tried here:1. Hush puppies- the corn bread that everyone raves about- they are in small bite sized, donut shaped bites. Pretty good but salty2. Baby Back Ribs- pretty good and soft-  but I prefer Everette  & Jones more3. Crabcakes- Good but very salty- the salad that comes with it however is very bitter- so it's good together4. Gumbo-I enjoyed this dish- there was a right amount of spice to it. It has an interesting sauce to it- the Creole-style BBQ Shrimp is actually smothered in this same sauce.5.  Creole-style BBQ Shrimp- as above this is actually in a sauce that's the gumbo taste- it's not the bbq taste that you would expect like for the ribs and i was actually not a fan of this shrimp.6.Cajun Mixed Grill-  this is a good one if you want to try a bit of different ones- this is the dish i got the first time i went but again nothing specialOverall, personally,  I think this place is overpriced, over-packed (long wait) and over-rated. Again this is my personal taste since even when i was waiting for our table, customers that were leaving said ""it's worth the wait and the food is soo good"". Prepare for very salty food and lots of water.  Just keep this in mind since I had very very high expectations because of the yelp reviews :("
190,"After being told by many acquaintances to check out Angeline -and walking past it many times while a wild crowd always seems to enjoy the fare inside- I visited yesterday in good company. Alas: vini, vidi, but non vici.The hushpuppies were good (though a tad dry), but everything else ( jambalaya, penne pasta, fried chicken, gumbo) was seriously heavy and seriously yet lacking in distinct flavor. Grease, OK,  but bad grease with no purpose but filler? Not my idea of pleasant dining. The presentation on our plates was also quite a turn-off: no effort, no art. Angeline, or Mary Callender? The dessert beignets, to boot, did not  taste like they were straight out of the kitchen; they were not fluffy, and they too lacked flavor. In my optimistic restaurant experience book, you can miss on entrees, but there's got to be at least a fine dessert to lift the experience: alas, it did not happen yesterday.The service, however, was efficient and friendly."
191,I honestly just didn't get the Cajun vibe. The food was nothing like what I expected. My daughter told me that their chicken is delicious. It could have been I just ordered the wrong item off the menu.
192,"Birthday Dinner Dissappointment!     :-(Sooo this place does have some very very good cajun-Naw'leans foods and i really want to love this place, but sadly must give 2 stars due to a terrible experience.....please note that I have been here a couple times and really do like the food.The Bad experience:In short, I ordered the Baby Back Rib dinner that was extremely tough, burnt, and dry.  I forced a couple down (2-3) and really wasn't even going to say anything bc I never do that, but a friend I was with had no problem sending them back and telling them that they were burnt.  Waitress was a bit offended and reluctantly brought back...bad day maybe?? Anyways, I was too embarrassed to send back, and when they eventually did come back, they gave me half the portion bc I had eaten like 2 of them.  They told me they'd only give me what I hadnt eaten....some might think that's fair and that's fine, but I mean really Angeline's?  I forced a couple overcooked and extremely burnt ribs to be nice and not say anything.  A friend sends them back, and you come back with less than half the portion I started with bc your cook nuked them?!? Pretty weak sauce I think.  Ps they were still a little bit burnt and overcooked but I wasn't going to send back yet again!  Get ribs elsewhere....Food:Hush Puppies:  B+Very good batter, perfectly fried, honey butter is okay, but they're still a little dry.  Recommendation--Keep honey butter and add Cajun creole sauce=delicious A+Sautéed Brussell Sprouts: B+Very good, but small portioned for $5.95. Good but not worth the costCrawfish Étouffée:  AVerrrrrryyyyy deliciously tastliciously good!Baby Back Ribs:  FBurnt, overcooked, dry, sauceless....miserable birthday dinner.Andouille Sausage: A-Classic, very good n tasty sausage, served with a grain mustard..solid.Creole Style BBQ Shrimp: AGreat and tasty!,!Gumbo:  ACreole Potatoe Salad: ABaked Mac n Cheese: A-Beers:  B+Nice touch on serving Abita beers made in Louisiana, love it! A little more of a selection on tap would be nice...Overall, all the food I have tried here has been very very good!!  The place always seems to be crowded and if you don't mind a little bit of a wait, Eat Here!  Angeline's has a very warm, dimly lit, and rustic style ambience to it.  All Cajun and creole cuisine here is delicious!  I highly recommend the crawfish étouffée too!  Maybe it was an off night for them, but from my experience Do NOT get the ribs! Terrible....  I don't even know why I got ribs at a Louisiana kitchen anyways, but I guess I was just craving them at the moment.  Too bad. Definitely a must go to restaurant in Berkeley!   Hopefully I will soon be able to put behind this bad experience here and go again...But until then, Sorry for the 2 stars.  I want to rate you higher, but am still disappointed in both the ribs, the service, and how this was handled.....Great restaurants should also have great service and a great understanding of how to treat their customers when they didn't meet expectations."
193,"We were very lucky that we got seating on Saturday night. Right after we sat down, the rush of people came in. This restaurant reminds me of an bar or an old hangout place with a pool table with an easy-going vibe. I had the jambalaya and took a bite out of a po'ol boy sandwich with oysters. Both were alright tasting. Nothing stood out in taste for us. We also had a side order of brussel sprouts. These brussel sprouts were excellent! I havn't had brussel sprouts in ages! haha...It still tastes the same! YUMMY! Of course, dessert has to follow. We had the beignets. These pastries with powdered sugar reminds me of malasadas in Hawaii. Warm and sweet! :O)"
194,"A short walk from downtown Berkeley bart stop .... always good!Very Friendly and Timely service with seating and bringing out the food. Cute place and the food was ok/good... I probably won't return but would suggest people judge for themselves. I like flavorful food but the only flavor they seemed to use on some of the food (my shrimp especially) was salt and a lot of it. About half way through our meal our waiter did bring over some lemon to put on which brought out some of the other flavors nicely it also helped with tthe salt a bit. I had the Voo Doo Shrimp and my friend had the Crawfish Etoufee. We shared the Sautéed Brussels Sprouts as a starter, they were very nicely cooked but again a little salty and I didn't taste any sage or much garlic. (Garlic is a hard one to miss!)  We had the banana pudding for dessert, it was good, served warm with a w/rum caramel sauce on top. If you like a little less sweetness push some of the sauce to the side. Few things I noticed while scoping out the place :)They do have gift certificates available as well the space is available for private parties. They ask that you make No substitutions, please! :("
195,"While the pretty decor and music lend to a New Orleans-like mood, I found my dining experience to be damn near appalling. The wait service was inconsistent and missing professionalism. No one ever bothered to tell me that there were dinner specials, the check came in the middle of dessert.As for the food, it was consistent with the service --- and that would be not good. For a starter, I had red beans and rice which was too salty and not all that flavorful. I chose fried catfish, hush puppies and potato salad for the entree. The highlight of the dinner was the catfish, which was about the only thing that came out right. The catfish was well-seasoned, could have been better but it was pretty good. As for the hush puppies and the potato salad, how very disappointing. Bland potato salad covered in some white mayo-like sauce. The hush puppies looked as if they had been cooked twice as long as necessary, but somehow kinda cold still. I felt a butcher knife was appropriate for cutting into them. They had a salty, baking soda like after-taste. And 50 cents for honey-butter? That's a cheap shot. I was hoping dessert would be this restaurant's saving grace. I chose something that I think is fairly simple to prepare, bread pudding with caramel sauce. Apparently for some, bread pudding is a difficult task. It also had a baking soda after-taste. Bread pudding should be served warm, this one was --- sort of, it was unpleasantly cold in the middle. Which surprised me as it took forever for the dessert order to arrive. At least the caramel sauce saved the experience.I had suggested to a group of friends to try it out for brunch because I saw how there was always a crowd coming out the door, but I've got serious regrets about that now."
196,"The service was excellent, we were immediately seated and the waitress was a doll. If this review were based solely on the service and atmosphere (loved the music and the lighting) then it'd get 4 stars. But the food, it just wasn't up to par. The fried chicken was actually very good, though the raves here are a little exaggerated in my opinion. It was crispy and tender and seasoned well, but the sauce that went along with it was bland.The sweet potato mash was seriously disappointing. Maybe I'm used to true down home southern cooking, but I expect my sweet potatoes to be sweet and spicy (with nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.) you know, full of FLAVOR. I wouldn't call anything I had that night flavorful (including the Parmesan green beans...)What I did like was the hush puppies, which though somewhat over cooked, were crispy and flavorful. The pecan pie was also quite good, though perhaps my expectations were so low at that point that anything would have been good. I also tried the voo doo shrimp (bland) and the catfish (decent, but nothing to write home to momma about). I may go back just for a poboy, since I didn't try that yet and it may be worth it. Otherwise, I'll stick to making my own southern cajun home cooking."
197,"I don't even know where to start with this place!  The service was the absolute worst I have ever experienced on the face of this earth. When we first walked in there were 4 or 5 girls so busy talking to each other that they didn't even see people coming through the door. Then our ""hostess"" (aka idiot) passed six perfectly good, empty tables to seat us in some weird area for two near the kitchen and other heavy foot traffic.  When we asked to sit at one of the other EMPTY tables the idiot hostess said  ""just hang out at your table until we set up another table"".  What?? hang out? All the tables were already set....and what appeared to be the ""manager"" stood and watched the whole exchange with some sour puss look on his face without saying a word....we should have left then but against our better judgment we just sat at the bar area.  Meanwhile the idiot hostess never came back to seat us at any of the other tables that remained empty for the remainder of the night.   The entire time we were there the manager kept walking past trying desperately to avoid eye contact.  Not sure what his problem was but it was very strange since we never asked to speak with him anyway.  We stayed at the bar area and ordered.  Our food was below average but better than the service.  When our waiter asked what we thought we told him about the seating issue and he said he already knew which hostess it was because everyone complains about her!  Ok well why is she still working there! Anyway he said that our dessert would be on him.  As we were eating the below average dessert another waitress walked up and started spraying the counter that we were eating on with some sort of cleaning solution....ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!  Before I could even say anything our waiter yelled her name...I guess to stop her.  At this point I'm looking for the cameras because I thought we were on an episode of Punked!   I can't believe anyone is this ignorant.... but if the person we thought was the manager is in charge of hiring I can see how it happened.  Anyway....never again will I step foot in this place.  As a matter of fact my prediction is that it will be closed down if they don't get their act together."
198,"The little mouse story. I've been to Angelines a few times and the food was delicious every single time. But... my heart was broken last time I was at Angeline's. After my husband and I stuffed our faces with damn good food, a woman across in the corner jumped up from her table and ran away from her chair screaming. There was a mouse/rat roaming around in the corner of the restaurant, as identified by one of the waiters. They explained that the mouse has probably gotten in through the front door which was open. Probability aside, after a visit to the restroom, I noticed that the backdoor leading to the dumpster right outside of the kitchen (which doesnt have additional doors) was wide open. I am crushed, CRUSHED that I will never return to Angeline's again."
199,This place gave me the worst food poisoning of my life.  No joke.  No exaggeration.  I have never felt more hellish than the 24 hours following my visit to Angeline's.
200,"Walk walk walk. Southern food? Sure let's go to Angelines!! Ok I think I've been there before! Yea let's go! My previous memory of Angelines was quite vague.  Nothing about it screams: OMG remember me and come back!! So this time around I was destined to make a note of it. We decided to have lunch at Angelines because I was tired of Japanese and was indecisive.  It won by default. We ordered the hush puppies to start off.  Hmm the first couple of bites was very tasty because of the complementary honey butter dip, which was very good.  However after one puppy you're pretty much done.  I ordered the fried catfish and he ordered the jambalaya with sausages.  My dish of fried catfish also came with an order of hush puppies. Ugh enough already!!    The Jambalaya was salty and didn't taste like much.  We both just picked at our food and there was really nothing to it.  By the end of the meal I was consumed with fatigue from all the grease.  I could not stand to even look at my food.  On the way home I felt kinda funny, uh oh.  Not a very good experience.Sorry, ugh what distaste."
201,"I've eaten here a handful of times at both lunch and dinner, and have concluded that the quality of the food does not outweigh the misery of the dining experience.  Pros: very good blue lake green beans, with a fresh snap and sweet, fresh taste.  Sweet mashed potatoes with a hint of vanilla and ginger.  Hot hush puppies with a whipped honey butter. Cons: Awful bread pudding.  It looked and tasted like a lump of bread.  Long wait times, misquoted wait times (usually at least three times as long as quoted, moreso at least twice), and slightly shady wait staff.  Once, although a table was plainly available, we were made to wait because the server doing the seating wanted to seat us in his section (why, I don't know- maybe it was a tipping thing, maybe he wanted our stellar company).  Additionally, I was at with Johnathan W. when the fifty minute wait time debacle occurred, and it truly was a problem that could have been avoided with a good hostess.  Overall, this place has decent food with a couple stellar items.  This place has done nothing to encourage me to dine at their establishment.   Next time I want green beans or sweet potatoes, I'm pretty sure I'll try to recreate the above instead of visiting the restaurant."
202,"I had the jambalaya and it was bland. The jambalaya at Elephant Bar has more kick. The BF had the fried chicken and was happy with that. I, however, will never go back to a Creole place that can't get jambalaya right."
203,This review is based on my experience with their take out.I called in to get the BBQ shrimp and grits that I have always gotten at the restaurant and my boyfriend came back with something that look like vomit and was not what I'd ordered at the restaurant.  We called and the manager was unhelpful saying they did not have such a dish.So there went 54 dollars out the window.... and my dinner is f'd
204,"Having a family from the south I had big expectations going in. However I knew that they would probably tone down the flavors because not everyone is used to spice. So I wouldn't hold that against them. I started with the boudin and hush puppies, hands down best hush puppies I've ever had!! the boudin was a let down not much flavor at all. My main course was their famous Shrimp creole, it was such a let down it literally tasted like they dumped chef boyardee all over the top of everything. The service was honestly horrible and that is saying something since I am a server myself. I understand mishaps and being busy but this was just plain bad. We waited over 20 minutes for ice t that was never once refilled even after multiple times of asking. It took  over an hour for my creole and a sandwich to come out. People came in and sat after us and has their food (and almost finished) by the time we got ours. He most likely forgot to put our order through the system but never compensated for anything. Once we finally finished we once again waited another 30 minutes before we could flag down anyone that would bring us the check. The hush puppies were great but not great enough to counter everything out. I don't think ill be back : /"
205,"There were so many high ratings for this place, so I wanted to give it a try. I've never had Cajun food prior to this little spot. The atmosphere was cozy, but I didn't feel like I was in Louisiana. Nice decor and paintings.Luckily for us, it was their first Sunday being open... which could POSSIBLY explain why I'm giving this place 2 stars.What was ordered:- Strawberry lemonade - it was WAY too sweet. Added some water to dilute it, but it didn't do much.- Oysters Bordelaise - My friend is a fan of cooked oysters. I'm not, but I decided to give it a try. Presentation was nice and simple with some butter lettuce as garnish. The garlic butter sauce was good. Didn't really like the cornmeal batter. Made it a little hard to chew.- Angeline's Gumbo - Presentation was nice even though it was just a bowl of Gumbo and rice haha. Pretty good size. Was very tasty and spicy. My friend couldn't even finish it was so much.- Crawfish Etoufee - Presentation was good. Green beans were a bit too soft for me. The Etoufee and rice had a nice taste when it first enters your mouth, but the taste disappears and becomes bland. Added some of the Crystal hot sauce for more taste, but it didn't do too much.Service: For a restaurant that's been receiving such high ratings, I was expecting better service. Instead the service was slow. For a while, there was only one server and I believe the owners/managers were there. Later on, another server clocked in, but it didn't seem to have helped much. Servers don't really seem to pay too much attention to customers and it's very hard to get their attention even though it wasn't very busy or  packed. I've never waited so long to ask for a check and then to have the check taken away and charged. Servers were in the back near the counter, chopping it up instead of checking on their customers. The food on the other hand, came out in a timely manner. Didn't have time to try a dessert. We just wanted to get the hell out of there.I'm willing to go back and try something else and hopefully receive better service, but this was a pretty bad first impression."
206,Pretty pricey for such bland food.  Skip this place.
207,"been here twice. first time i had the jambalaya and second time i had the fried chicken. maybe my palate can't tell the difference between good southern food and bad southern food, but i wasn't impressed by the taste or the price. i've definitely had better for way cheaper. honestly the chicken didn't taste any better than popeye's and definitely worse than church's"
208,"Their signature dish, Voodoo shrimp, was disappointing. The green bean was very over cooked to the point it was limp."
209,"Food 3Service 2Ambiance 2Generally, the food was either over- or underseasoned.  Standouts were the strawberry lemonade...the must mix a strong carbonated beverage into it which makes it addictive, while the sweet tea was average.The gumbo was tasty, probably a 3.5 stars and the sausage with the rice and pork filling was a 4...the rice provides a surprisingly nice and different texture to the sausageThe ribs were boiled versions that did fall off the bone but was soaked in over sweetened bbq sauce.  The chicken dish (which is the most popular) tasted under seasoned while the sweet yams had a heavy ginger flavor and was not too sweet.When factoring in the wait time and poor service, i wouldnt go back to the place as no dish was truly worth the hassle...but that unique strawberry lemonade is memorable."
210,"I really wish my experience here was better. I have been looking forward to eating here since September when my fiancé moved here. Now that I live here too we finally made it here for lunch.I visit New Orleans frequently and with the manager boasting the chef was from Baton Rouge I completely dove into the menu ordering way more than I could eat. Unfortunately my taste buds were not impressed.I've had better beignets at a 50s diner in LA which speciality was burgers and fries. Shrimp po boy from popeyes is better. Potato salad taste like straight mayo. My fiancé got the cat fish and hush puppies. He said the hush puppies were good but he's had way better catfish. The remoulade sauce was overpowered by horse radish.To make matter worse our server Anthony was horrible. He never checked on us to see how our food was or if we needed anything. Mind you both of our drinks were empty and I clearly needed some napkins. We sat there for 5mins w/o touching our food before a waiter asked if we needed some boxes. Of course it wasn't our own waiter, he didn't bring us our food, or check either. The place is really small and we could see when our food was ready, he was standing right there but kept talking to his coworker. Another waitress kindly brought our food over when she noticed our waiter clearly was not interested.Overall very disappointed in the food anus service.One star is for the hush puppies and the other is for the 3 other servers that helped us when our on server Anthony was too busy conversing with the Manager about what they did all week."
211,"Underwhelming. Our supposed 20-minute wait dragged on to something more like 50. Once seated, I had the voodoo shrimp and my girlfriend had the crawfish étoufée. Also a side of mac & cheese to split, and I tried the swamp water (aka 1/2 lemonade, 1/2 unsweetened iced tea, you probably know it as an Arnold Palmer). I am not generally picky about presentation but plating on both the entrées left quite a bit to be desired, they both basically come out as a large blob of gravy on a bed of rice, with a side of fairly undercooked green beans. For a $7 food truck meal this would be fine, but at $16.99 time to try harder, guys. The voodoo shrimp was a nice blend of savory and sweet, with some interesting but not overpowering spice notes on the finish (cinnamon?). We both enjoyed it quite a bit more than the étoufée, which lacked depth and was almost inedibly salty. The mac and cheese is barely worth talking about; a nice oven-baked crust masks underdone pasta floating in an an unctuous, bland sauce which seemed to be made from velveeta. At $2.50 the swamp water was the thing I enjoyed the most--lemony, refreshing and not too sweet. Overall an okay experience, with bonus points for the interesting decor, but one I probably would not repeat given far superior dining options within walking distance."
212,"I'd like to get one thing off my shoulder first:F*CK YOU ANGELINE'S LOUISIANA KITCHEN.It really does take a lot to get me riled up in a restaurant, but Angeline's managed to make my dinner experience the worst I've ever experienced. My friend and I sat at our table for a full 2 hours.I have a great load of patience for waiting 1-2 hours on a busy night on a backed up kitchen because I understand the stress the staff can be going under, but it was a normal Monday night (not packed, no huge parties, and there were still open seats). We were there to see two rounds of guests next to us come and go, and our waiter basically ignored us for the whole night except asking us to basically get out. Inexcusable.Here's the timeline of the events that occurred:6:30PM - seated, water & drink order6:45PM - appetizer & entree order6:45PM - couple next to us finish their meal, and another couple sit down7:15PM - appetizers arrive7:30PM - the couple next to us receive their meal, and they arrived after us. wtf.7:45PM - our waiter asks us if we'd like dessert - this is AWESOME as we haven't even received our main course yet, assholes.7:45PM - the couple next to us leave and a third set of people come.7:50PM - we finally get our main course8:05PM - we finish and ask for the check8:15PM - we get the check. wtf man I wanted to leave sooner.Here's what we got though:Appetizers/DrinksSweet Tea - awesome sweet tea! not too sweet and infinite refills. Drank 3 rounds while waiting for 2 hours.Boudin Sausage - 1 sausage with arugula, cherry tomatoes and mustard, tasted like any other sausage. srsly.Hushpuppies - 6 hushpuppies (fried corn meal balls) served with a heaping mountain of honey butter, like 10x more than you neededPotato Salad - potato salad made with halves of mini red potatoes, tossed with mayo, chives, cayenne pepper, and some olive oil - it was pretty goodEntreesJambalaya with andouille sausage - tasted like tomato rice so my friend had to add a bit of pepper and hot sauce to make it taste like anything sort of a jambalaya, it was also a bit saucy and not so much stickyFried Chicken - 3 chicken breasts with a buttermilk fried skin, sweet potato mashed potatoes (tasted like how you expect, just mashed sweet potatoes), green beans (a bit mushy, but well salted), and a swimming pool of thick creamy gravy - chicken itself was not that great because it was made with chicken breasts which come out tasteless and kinda dry when fried.. they should have used thighs...$50 for everything so its moderately priced. We considered getting the beignets but were scared of another 1 hour wait. The service was just so poor that it's not worth it to come back to eat because my friend and I were expecting to have real Cajun/Creole/Southern food, but Angeline's did not deliver. Epic 2-hour-phail-phest."
213,"My first experience I enjoyed the food and the service was good. My second experience was completely opposite. The food wasn't good. I send back my original order for something else and that also wasn't good. My cousins meal wasn't much better. We found ourselves looking for a Server who was not readily available. Not sure why, there were only 7-8 tables in use. Unfortunately, I won't be going back."
214,"Update!Okay. I gave this place another shot, and it turns out that the saltiness of the food was not just a one-shot mistake.Let's start with the positive. They gave us six hush puppies! That was brilliant, as it is easily divisible by two OR three people. Smart move, Angeline.But I had the Crawfish Etoufee, which was personally recommended by our hale and hardy waitress, clearly a woman of strong constitution. I had not eaten in over eight hours, and so my stomach sang with anticipation for the craws. The spicy/sweet mess before me was delicious.... for about two bites. Then the overpowering saltiness puckered my whole body, and I downed two glasses of water, plus I ate half of the ice chips out of my friend's beverage.Y'all. This place is SALTY. I am very sensitive to salt, and I have been so lucky the past couple of times I was here to have been hungry enough to MAKE it through two bites of this food. I'm sure it's delicious to those with a higher pH than me. But I just cannot ever go here again.Honestly, the two stars are generous. I just appreciate the even-numbered hush puppy order."
215,"Wow, I apparently went on a bad day or something.  A friend and I had a shrimp po boy and crawfish etoufee for lunch -- entirely tasteless.  When we asked for some sauce to tried to add some moisture, our server seemed miffed.I definitely won't go back, which is too bad because I really try to support businesses in the 'hood.  But there are many other (and better) places to spend my hard earned coins."
216,"Like most restaurants, Angeline's is in the ""Alright/Good/Tasty but Nothing Special"" category. It has a cute ambiance and we had a nice waiter so maybe its unfair to give this place two stars.However, I found it hard to enjoy myself when I expected  REAL down-home Louisiana soul food and I came across the equivalent of what The Olive Garden is to Italians. I kept asking myself ""What Gumbo has only four ingredients?!"", and ""What does fried chicken TENDERS have to do with Louisiana cooking?!"" Even more of a bummer is the fact that my sig other and I paid 40 bucks for one shared entree and two appetizers. Definitely not worth the price if you know better southern cookin'.   Overall, If you're looking for a safe and comfortable ""introduction to soul food"" Angelines is the place, go for it! I won't be coming back if I can help it. I should have prepped my mind for what I saw so its my fault I'm disappointed.Angelines, its me not you!"
217,I wouldn't recommend this restaurant because the food isn't very good. I went their over the weekend and had the Shrimp Creole very weak sauce with very few shrimp in the dish. I ordered the Hush Puppies they were over cooked tested really bad. It took a long time to get each dish. I've been to Louisiana this wasn't the same.
218,"I would give it 3 stars, except for the unattentive waiter we had.  Also, the Gumbo was unnecessarily over-spiced, and their cold slided bread is of inferior quality...  The music can be annoying and it is played so loud it is hard to have a nice conversation.  Its an EAT AND GET COMFORT FOOD OUT TYPE PLACE.  The appearance is slightly divey and the chairs around each table feel crowded."
219,"Cute little spot. Food was tasty, BUT the portions were too small for the price.  My cousin and I both ordered the fried catfish entree that come with hushpuppies and we substituted the potato salad with the mashed sweet potatoes.  3 tiny pieces of catfish and I lost count of how many pieces of hushpuppies (although pretty yummy) and the mashed sweet potatoes were mediocre.  The house sparkling lemonade was pretty good.  They have a ""Swamp Water"" under the drinks list and when I asked what that was the waiter informed me that it was simply an Arnold Palmer (tea w/ lemonade).  That was pretty disappointing as they could have been a little more creative.  Overall dining experience was a little under OK mainly due to the lack of fried catfish (very yummy) since it was the catfish entree.  They should rename it the hushpuppy entree with a side of catfish :-/."
220,"If there is one thing I can't stand, it is waiting to pay money for food.  Don't get me wrong, we probably should have booked a reservation ahead of time, but it is utterly ridiculous to wait an hour and forty-five minutes for a table of 6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Seriously, what the F@$%^$#K!!!!!!Besides this, the food was very good.  The gumbo is probably the closest thing to Nawlin's gumbo in the bay.  The hush puppies were awesome, but anything deep fried is good.  The rib's were okay.  My friends think it was good, but I only concluded that the bourbon sauce masked the fact that the meat was over cooked.  Stay away from the jambalaya, it isn't very good.  The best dish there is by far the is the buttermilk fried chicken.Again, if it wasn't for the wait, which seems to be all the time, I could have easily gave this place a five.  The service, once you sit down, is awesome.I can't believe I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes to pay for food, no matter how good the food is.  Would you?  Service is everything in the restaurant biz."
221,"Came here for a special occasion, but the meal was not at all memorable.  I think the hush puppies were good, but not worth the drive from anywhere.  This may be a better neighborhood restaurant, but it is definitely not a destination."
222,"I have heard about this place. And was really excited to eat some good food. We ordered Fried Catfish Fried Chicken - which was boneless Mac & Cheese Beignets Granny Apples & Caramel First of all, the fried food was salted WAY TOO MUCH. I cannot tell you how annoying this was. Because with the EXTRA salt the food was below average. We actually wiped the food off to remove excess salt. the strange thing was that you could not see the salt. Dang it under the salt was some really good food. Catfish came with hush puppies (good) but salty, also potato salad (average) Fried Chicken came with green beans (Awesome) and sweet potato mash (not a good combo with salty chicken) Mac & Cheese was (OK) This is where the 3 stars shine I looked at the desert menu. We kind of just wanted to leave in defeat. But I said we are here, let's just order something. So my special lady friend ordered beignets and I needed something clean to eat like Granny Smith apples. Beignets were covered with powdered sugar (it looked like a 1980's coke party) I mean piles of powdered sugar. Freaking great! Yes success... And the apples did the trick, totally cleaned the palate and left us with a fresh feeling after the salty fried entrees. In closing we said we will come back here again, but order something completely different. Morning after. I thought we made the trip from the peninsula to east bay. Spent $65 with tip and really did not enjoy the food."
223,"I tried to let it go, I really did. But I just can't. Remember the experience that was your incentive to get a Yelp logon? Angelines is mine. I talked my friends into driving across the bridge to branch out - I missed the Crescent City Cafe and wanted a taste. We had an 8pm Saturday reservation for 5, and arrived on time. There were 15 people in line when I walked in. I went straight to the front and waited for the owner to tell him our party was ready. He said that they were a ""little behind, with one reservation in front of us yet to be seated"". He directed us next door to the Irish pub and promised to call my cell in say, 30-45 minutes? I left the pub close to 9pm and went back to Angelines. Boy was I surprised to see the line cleared out, with everyone seated. The owner ignored me for a few minutes, before finally asking me if all my party was there. Dude. We were finally seated 80 minutes after our reservation. We got our first drink of water 100 minutes after our res. They were out of everything (fries and steak and jambalaya and whatever else I've repressed), and offered no options. Our waiter suggested that we come earlier if we expect to eat. Actually I think he phrased it ""You go out for dinner at 10pm on a Saturday night and you wonder why we are sold out?""It got worse. When we left, the owner tried to make small talk with us to smooth things over. As we were walking down the sidewalk, he bid us farewell. ""Hope you come back and try us again. Maybe make a reservation and come on a night when you know it won't be so busy!"""
224,"4 stars for the service and appetizers1 star for my mealhere's why:Ever have a friend who dared you to eat an entire, let's say, bottle of hot sauce?  Yeah, well that was my experience.  Eating a plate of jambalaya at Angeline's was like being dared to eat an entire can of tomato paste.  How dare they charge me $13.95 on top of such nonsense?  Absolutely horribly executed dish that everyone at the table agreed tasted like eating tomato paste out of the can. Beware of the catfish as well it tastes like it's straight from the fish farm.  No bottom feeder flavor at all.  May as well serve deep fried tilapia."
225,"My friend Chuck and I were looking forward to this place with great excitement and high hopes. After all, the search for a great Cajun/Southern dining experience is often an elusive one. It's unfortunate that the two us will have to keep searching.To start....The two of us were seated promptly after walking in. A glance at the menu revealed many of the classic Cajun/Southern specialties we had hoped to find, including sweet tea. We both ordered a glass, finding it subtle yet perfectly sweetened, not cloyingly sweet as I have experienced at other places. After reviewing the menu, the two of us settled on an Andouille sausage starter, potato salad, and hush puppies. For our main courses, Chuck ordered the Fried Chicken while I settled on the Jambalaya. 25 minutes later....We finally got our starters, at the moment both of us were beginning to get impatient:Andouille Appetizer: While it was slightly crisp on the outside and juicy  on the inside, overall it was bland flavored and too mellow compared to what I am used to, without any hint of detectable spice or the characteristic kick. The accompanying brown mustard and arugula seemed to be an afterthought on the plate, leaving us to wonder what they were doing there. Even if it had been tasty, I felt that it certainly wasn't worth the $6.95 price tag for one lone link.Hush puppies: The brown crispy exterior made for an excellent contrast with the sweet cornmeal interior complemented by the honey butter served alongside. Potato Salad: The dressing was creamy with a slight heat coming from the whole grain mustard and cayenne. The halved red potatoes were cooked well, not to soft and not rock hard, a problem plaguing many potato salads.At this point in the meal, we were still looking forward to our main courses, hoping the long wait for our starters would not repeat itself...35 minutes later....By this time, the couple sitting next to us that came in BEFORE US had already quickly gone through their starters and were already dining on their main courses, while Chuck and I waited and waited, and waited some more. Our waiter finally came to refill our sweet tea glasses asked us, ""Would you two like dessert?"" This killed the entire evening for me. At this point both of us thought no matter how ethereal or amazing the food was the experience was tainted. It wasn't until after this moment that we were finally served our main courses:Jambalaya: My disappointment from our long wait only grew from my first bite. All I could taste in my mouth was a sweet tomato sauce laced with rice, chicken and more andouille sausage. There was no discernible spice or heat, all I could taste was tomato. Some added hot sauce spiced the dish up a little bit, however not by much. Definitely not worth $12.95.Fried Chicken: while the outside was fairly crisp and paired well with the accompanying cream gravy, the chicken itself was bland, attributed to the fact that it was a boneless breast piece. While I didn't taste the accompanying mashed sweet potato or green beans, I doubt I was missing much as we both sat straight faced finishing our courses with our palates immensely dissappointed.Afterwards, we considered ordering beignets for dessert, yet considering how long it took us just to get our previous courses, I felt that I at least wanted to get to sleep tonight, so I passed. After paying the check and writing out our feelings of dissatisfaction on it, we walked out with our hopes dashed and mouths disappointed; our yearning for the ideal Southern/Cajun experience still lingering."
226,"The flavor was ok nothing really special. The iti bitty serving for $18 a plate. Meh, Me thinks not!"
227,"overhyped, overpriced, overcrowded, under seasoned....this is the poster child for the continuing saga known as ""the SF Bay Area doesn't know sh*t about southern cooking or BBQ""....give me grease, give me carbs, but at least make it taste good. sorry to say but in a word...""mediocre"""
228,"A small group of 2-3 may be seated very quickly, but don;t even think about it if you have a group of 6 or more. There are no tables and no way they can set a table for 6 with the number of customers.We ordered some starters - gumbo and hushpuppies, the same starters that everyone else orders.After waiting 20 minutes for starters and seeing that another table that came after us with same number of people and same starters are already eating, I waved for the waiter to come over.Me: Hey, can you help me check on our starters?Waiter: ::gibberish in a thick mexican accent that he suddenly developed and he rushes away::5 minutes later, I walk up to the kitchen/bar area after seeing that every employee has their back turned to the restaurant and no one is giving us eye contact. I tap the waiter on the shoulder,Me: Hey, did you help me check on our starters?Waiter: Oh no, I didn't.Me: ::wtf face and angry tone:: ok, so what's going on?Waiter: I don't know, you'll have to ask him ::points to another waiter::Waiter #2: Is there a problem?Me: Yeah, we're still waiting for our starters!Waiter #2: We're still waiting on some stuff.Me: Well, I noticed this other table of 5 with the exact same starters got their's when they ordered 10 minutes after usWaiter #2: ::points at some random plates at the counter:: These are your's coming upMe: ok, fine5 minutes later, they finally manage to bring it out.Food is sooooo salty I had to beg for water and they took their sweet time to bring it out."
229,"i've been to angeline's a number of times and it's our favorite place in the southern/cajun genre at this price point. since the food is good but nothing to do cartwheels about, i think this ranking is more of a reflection of the local food offerings than their stellar dining experience. that being said, this last visit put a big question mark on any future visits. on the plus side, the place has expanded since we were last there so it's more spacious and brighter. on the downside, we noticed a decrease in the quality of the servers. sure, he did everything that a reasonable server is supposed to do: greet us, take our order, check in with us, ask about dessert, etc., but the overriding feeling was that our server was too cool for school and generally gave off an air of ""i'd rather be somewhere else, or with someone else."" ugh. i personally do not want a server to fawn over me but is it too much to ask for mutual respect? minimal levels of cordiality? food review:fried catfish--respectable carbo-riffic plate of beige food: fried catfish, hush puppies, potato salad-- what's a vegetable?mixed grill-- tastyjambalaya-fineshrimp creole--fine, but i'm not a fan of Uncle Ben's so thumbs down on the starch for me but i'm sure folks dig the Uncle. shrimp voodoo--fine, ditto the comment about Uncle Ben'sside of brussel sprouts--beneath the grease there is a reasonably tasty vegetable. too bad you get a child's handful for 5.95green beans--fine but somewhat bland.overall: meh minus. Angeline's: Please, lose the attitude because empirically your food is not that amazing and it's not worth dealing with parking in this area on a friday night."
230,"I really hate to go against the grain here after reading all of these glowing reviews but eating at Angeline's is like eating sweaty ass.  I went with a group of coworkers who all thought it was ""ok"".  I'm the only one who left hungry because my vegetable muffuletta was dry and nasty and although the menu claimed that the vegetables were ""grilled"", they tasted like they came from a jar.  The hush puppies were dry and the only flavor they had was of the grease that coated my mouth after eating one.  Nastay!Also, the wait staff was slow and forgetful, but to give them the benefit of the doubt they did tell us they were short staffed that day.I give one star for the bananas foster bread pudding that I DIDN'T have. =("
231,"Update to Angeline's.  So after the whole shrimp in the chicken pasta dish, and the non-white meat, rubbery chicken pieces, just being honest, I decided to go for the Vegetarian alternative of this dish, which I was happy to see.  This time stayed away from the Hush Puppies due to that fish oil taste, and found the vegeterian blue cheese penne pasta dish to be flavorless.  I had most of it packaged to go, figured it would be good as a leftover.  Not to be, I totally kept it at the back of the fridge, not looking forward to eating it.  The service this time was not very receptive, our waiter kept forgetting to bring us things:  water, we asked for a glass of water three times, since we had ordered lemonade that came later, we were just happy to have something to drink and let it go.  My friend also had a side salad and it didn't come until the end. The friend really likes this place, and I was so happy at first as it is a cool vibe inside, nice cocktail drinks, and the thought of yummy southern food.  The interior is cool, it's a cute spot but there is really nothing there that I look forward to eating, so not going back anytime soon."
232,"THIS IS NOT SOUL FOOD/ NOT HOMESTYLE COOKING. This is overpriced chicken strips and baby food. Do not be deceived! Ugh, the fried chicken is boneless chicken (wtf), and the mashed potatoes are sweet potatoes that isn't even that great. You get small ass portions for a huge ass price, and the service sucks here. I came with two others, and they agreed, not worth the hype."
233,"I really want to LOVE this place.  I love New Orleans food... and the idea of being able to steal away from the Berkeley campus to get my grub on... and whisk myself away to the crescent city (on shattuck avenue)...what a great opportunity.  Today, I realized... I am asking way too much of this place... and Unfortunately, this afternoon... the service was a mess.   Not pleasant!Our order took forever, and when campus employees are on a time crunch... this place needs to be better at their timing (or else lose a lot of patrons).  i liked my shrimp po' boy... but didn't have enough time to savor it because it took so long to get from order... to kitchen ... to table. now for the good news: they had an amazing brussels sprout side dish  that was nice... brown butter and garlic cooked brussels sprouts... i hate brussels sprouts... until having their side dish, today.  And their desserts are good... the bread pudding is decent.Otherwise, this place is just okay... it's not mothers, palace cafe, or napoleons, or dooky chase....having a bite to eat here, just makes me sad that i am not in new orleans."
234,Was disappointed eating here recently.Pros:1) Hush puppies are excellent 2) Brussell sprouts are a must3) Good for a timed dinner before theater at the Berkeley RepImprovement needed:1) Food was a bit watery - there is much better Lousiana food out there.2) Service was rushed - I also saw a waitress give multiple sour looks to other servers.   It gave a bad vibeWorth a try - I could have been there on an off night
235,"To start, let me just say that our waitress at the restaurant was extremely friendly. But I think that's about where my ""excellent"" experience ends.I thought hey, great place for a birthday dinner. Not too expensive, area for larger parties, nice little neighborhood in Berkeley. Yes, the hush puppies were good, especially with the honey butter. Actually I think it was just the honey butter. Just give me some of that, slather that on a piece of anything and it'd be good. I tried the jambalaya and the cajun mixed grill. I don't know if the jambalaya is supposed to taste like that to be honest but I know it did not appeal to my taste buds. And seeing as how I love food I think there was something wrong with the jambalaya. It was way too creamy and had a strange taste to it. I couldn't really taste anything but the stew that it was cooked in and after eating about 3 bites I actually got sick of it. And definitely do not order the cajun mixed grill. It comes with BBQ ribs, hot links, grilled shrimp, and potato salad. The only thing that was good on the plate was the potato salad. And even though it wasn't that pricey I still expected a little more in terms of quantity for southern/soul food cooking. We also got the the beignets and the banana pudding. But were okay at best. The beignets tasted like anywhere else. If you fry a donut and then mound sugar on top it's going to taste good. Banana pudding was on the delicate side and brought out some good flavors. And again service was fantastic. Besides that though, I wasn't very impressed with this place and most likely will not be coming back.***Side note: A couple of our friends ordered the fried chicken and that turned out to be pretty good.***"
236,"I was surprised I didn't like this place. I had such high expectations being a restaurant where there is usually a line of people waiting outside.Let's focus on the food. Me and my friend order hush puppies to start off. They were mediocre, so for the high price i had to pay for like 6 hush puppies didn't really sit well with me. Then, I ordered the jumbalya (before my no meat days), and was hoping to finally taste some authentic southern style cuisine...Nope. It tasted like i was just eating a can of tomato sauce or ketchup with rice in it. I was not impressed and never went back. I wonder sometimes if it was fluke, but that one experience just doesn't motivate me to go back and have them redeem themselves.Thank you anyway, Ms.Angeline.2 stars!"
237,"Way overpriced. Meal portions are mediocre and the food isn't anything impressive. My meal was nothing more than a few green beans, at most 5 small shrimp, and dull rice. It's been way too loud everytime I've come here. Everyone is practically yelling just to hold a conversation. I won't be back."
238,"I grew up in Baton Rouge, and had high hopes for Angeline's due to its many positive Yelp reviews. I enjoyed my food enough, but due to the price ($14/entree and up) and smallish portions, I will probably not return. The hush puppies, as has been said, are delectable. The jambalaya was served in a sauce I couldn't identify - it was fine, but did not trigger any memories of home (I don't recall eating saucy jambalaya in Louisiana, although it must be said that jambalaya varies quite a bit across the state). If things were a little less pricey, I would certainly return in hopes that my one experience was just an unfortunate one, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon. Not that Angeline's needs the extra business: it was packed solid the whole time I was there."
239,"I never went here before the expansion, but I went with friends last night and was sorely disappointed.  The waiter was friendly, but the execution from the kitchen was chaos.  We waited quite a while and then four of the five of us got our meals.  Our fifth friend never got his dish.  We waited quite a while and then got the waiter over and complained.  He went back and reordered from the kitchen.  Our friend finally got his dish just as the rest of us were finishing our small portions.  The portions were the most disappointing.  You really have to expect large portions at a southern restaurant, especially when the prices would suggest either huge portions or really high quality, well executed food.  We got neither.  The kitchen seemed overwhelmed as waiters and waitresses lined up at the service station.Though, the fried chicken was good and the waiter comped us some beignets for the mix up.  They were the best part of the mealFriday night.  50 minute wait for a table.  Expected more."
240,"Festive atmosphere plus decent food though. Personally, though, I loaded on a bit more hot sauce on my meal and have definitely had more flavorful cajun food elsewhere, though can't find any in the area.Try their PoBoys for lunch and be sure to order some gumbo.   Be sure to wash it all down with a glass of their Sweet Tea or one of their VooDoo Beers!For dessert, I highly suggest the bread pudding, but be sure to order it when you get your entrees because it takes some time to prepare."
241,"Infamous for its outrageously slow service and hit-or-miss dishes, Angeline's is a noisy, cramped restaurant featuring overpriced cajun/creole food.  Angeline's is heavily shilled on Yelp, so take those glowing reviews with a grain of salt; the negative reviews about this place certainly reflect my two experiences there.  When the kitchen at Angeline's is at its best, it turns out meals which are about as good as what you'd get at an average New Orleans neighborhood restaurant.  When the kitchen is off, the food can actually be inedible.  The place is a crapshoot, and when you've spent an hour waiting for your food, you really don't need that.Then there is the matter of attitude.  I once overheard the smirky owner insult a dissatisfied customer in this way: The lady called the owner to her table, and showed him the little pile of rock-hard fried shrimp which were on her shrimp po-boy.  I could see them on her plate, and they were obviously way overcooked.  She told the owner that she had the sandwich there before and it was very good, but that this one was inedible.  The owner told her in a low tone that  ""Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds"".  To the customer's credit, she didn't respond to this dig, but just stood her ground in a very civil way.  I think the owner comped her for the sandwich, but he later made a show of proclaiming, for the benefit of nearby diners, how the restaurant prides itself on its consistency.  What a jerk.  Later, I overheard the customer say to her companion that she'd never come back.Ignore the shills who are Yelping this place up, and spend your dining-out dollars elsewhere, where you can get a better value for your time and money -- and a little respect.  I'll never go back to Angeline's, either."
242,Wack! I don't know why people think this place is so great! The only thing they got going for them is top notch service! Food was not good at all.
243,"I don't care where you're from, service should not be this bad. There's a difference between a slow, laid back pace and being incompetent. ***Update 1/29/07***So I revisited ALK during lunch to see if things improved. We were greeted by the owner in a friendly way, and he was obviously happy as they now have a beer & wine license. One of my coworkers tried one of the beers, can't recall which one. Another table had the beignets, looked like they've started to cut back on the powdered sugar mountain which is a good thing. Our group decided on mostly po'boys, shrimp or oyster, and another had a salad. The po'boys were above average, the shrimp/oysters perfectly done. The gumbo was ok, nothing spectacular. But again, the food was fine but the service sucked. Things started out fine. Attentive service with drinks and stuff. Then we sat there. For an HOUR until our food came out. The restaurant was busy, but not full. And come on, how do a couple sandwiches and a salad take an hour to make? No apology about the time either from anyone. The owner seems like a nice guy from what I've overheard him saying with other tables, but apart from seating us he didn't stop by. Which I wouldn't expect usually, but he should've noticed that our group was sitting at the largest table in the place for an hour with no food. And our bill gets messed up with the server charging for something we didn't order. The entire group concurred, the food is fine and there's nothing wrong with the prices. But the service is sketchy. We seriously had a 2+ hr lunch here and that's just not right... ******So after reading all the reviews, knew I had to try out ALK. No starters because I wanted the beignets. Yes, I know, restraint isn't usually my forte. But whatever. After we were seated, the nice waitress offered to bring us hot water with lemon because it's so freaking cold outside. We declined, but appreciated the gesture. I ordered the sweet tea. Not overly sweet, just right. I'm no expert, but I think sweet tea is supposed to be already sweetened as it's steeped. Theirs seemed to be ice tea with simple syrup poured in the glass, making the entire concoction not properly mixed. This was the first thing I overlooked as after a few swirls, the sweet tea was fine. I had the fried chicken. The chicken was juicy, but not much flavor. The sauce was good, but slightly too rich for me. I had to use sparingly. The mashed sweet potatoes were really good. Easily the best thing. My compadre had the famous bbq shrimp. It came on rice and had beans on the side. It looked basically like stir fried shrimp and the sauce was somehow reminiscent of hoisin sauce. Not horrible, but I wouldn't order it next time. Then to the beignets. The four little pillow of goodness came in a bowl and topped by what must've been 3 cups of powdered sugar. I have a sweet tooth and all, but this was a tad much. After digging thru the powder to get some fluffiness, well they were kinda eh. They weren't bad, guess I just had such high expectations. Next time I'll go for the banana bread pudding. The food was average, maybe it depends on what you order. We had really great service for the first half of the meal. The kind of service where you're fine tipping 25% and letting the mgr know about it. But once our food came, it went downhill. We were done with the entrees, but our plates seriously sat there for a good 20 minutes before we flagged the waitress down. She wasn't that busy either. Walked past our table easily 10 times. So did the busboy. I had to ask for a refill. My compadre's refill was brought about 5 minutes after mine. On the other hand, the owner/manager guy seemed really nice and friendly. I have mixed feelings, especially about the service, and it seems like many of the more recent reviews do too. Hopefully it gets straightened out because I think this place could really make it."
244,"This rating is because of my girlfriend's catfish. It had a very pungent smell - one that reminded me of an old fish tank sitting in a dingy pet fish store. Neither of us eat catfish, but she wanted to give it a try. Neither of us knew what catfish was supposed to smell like (otherwise we would have sent it back). When we looked it up on the Internet afterwards - its not supposed smell - we were naive. I'm like Mikey,  put it on my plate and I'll eat it. She gave me a piece of her catfish - I had a bite and could not eat it. A chef must have a sense of smell. I could almost smell the fish as it was laying on my sweet potatoes.  They should not have let the catfish leave their kitchen - or even make it into their kitchen.Two starts because the host was nice and my fried chicken dish was pretty good."
245,"For the prices, I was definitely unimpressed. I had the gumbo and my companion had the fried chicken tenders. I am a bit of a gumbo fanatic, and the ham and okra just didn't come together quite right. I find the gumbo at Crogan's to be more consistent and spicy. Basically, this place is a very earnest attempt by white people to make money selling what they believe is Creole/Southern food. I won't begrudge them their niche, and I'll admit that I am a sucker for any cuisine that ranges towards the artery-clogging. Too bad the execution fell short, there are cute touches like beverages served in jars, but ultimately the flavor and atmosphere were lacking, and it means that I won't be likely to return."
246,"Unimpressive and a little expensive. We tried the regular and the vegetarian jambalayas, and finished neither. Every bite was exactly the same, from first to last: too sweet, too sour, slightly spicy, mushy. No variation, no depth. The mashed sweet potatoes and hush puppies were both acceptable, but nothing special."
247,"Wait  -  Zero starsFood -  2 starsI just do not understand why there was such a long wait for this restaurant.  We waited for 1.5 hours on a wednesday night all for some at best mediocre Louisiana food.I always thought that Southern food should be full of flavor.  This place would be the opposite of that, everything just tasted bland.......We orderedAppetizersHush Puppies - 5 bucks for 6 hush puppies that should come with your dinner for free.  Mediocre 3.5 stars for taste and 1 star for the price.Gumbo - Defined bland.  No kick, no spice, missed that heartiness that gumbo should give you.  Also needed some more seafood.Andouille Sausage App - What a joke.......  6 bucks for a small andouille sausage?  I can go to costco and buy a packet of 16 Aidell's chicken apple suasgae for 10 bucks.  Please do yourself a favor and do not order this.EntreesCatfish - 2 stars.  Tasted too much corn meal.  No flavor.  I coulkd make this better at home.Chicken - 5 stars for chicken, zero stars for the other crap on this plate.    The serve this with some yam mush crap that was nastae and some overboiled greenbeans that had no flavoring and needed salt.  Bad....Jambalaya4 stars.  Probably the best thing they had here.Shrimp creole thingy in tomato sauce -Shrimp tasted fine.  But the sauce was just lacking.  Lacking any type of flavor, or kick, or complexity.  Bottom Line -Flavor = LackingWait = Not worth it and you should definitely go somewhere elsePrice = Not really worth what u r getting.Don't bother trying if there is a wait or if it the weekend."
248,"Two stars for the really nice guy who was the host and sat us and got us water.  Wish I'd gotten his name.Minus three stars for everything else that started with a mouse wandering across the floor and ended up with me getting food poisoning after trying the BBQ Shrimp appetizer.My husband is from Louisiana, but neither of us expect ""Cajun"" food out here in California to be at all like what you get in his home-state.Nonetheless, we've had good attempts and bad attempts and this was pretty close to the worst, not to mention the most overpriced.  For example, $10.25 for FOUR quarter-sized shrimp and three pieces of stale sourdough baguette.But on to the experience... we were sat after several minutes of wait, in the nearly empty restaurant.  We waited several more minutes for our waitress, Amber, to take our drink order (sweet tea).  She was okay, but distant, rushed and very hard to get the attention of.  Several more again, and we got our tea, which had gone rancid and was undrinkable.  It was, after a few more minutes, exchanged for coke that had more water than syrup and tasted nothing like a coke, but at least was drinkable.  Refills were damn near impossible to get.Since we'd never been to this place, we ordered large, trying a broad selection- I requested the shrimp appetizer and my husband the cup of gumbo.  After fifteen minutes or so, (there were two other couples in the entire place), the appetizers came and we got to order our entrees; he got the jambalaya and I asked for the buttermilk fried chicken.The first shrimp I tried was actually really good!  It made me hopeful that, despite the minuscule portions, that the food would be tasty.  The second one, however, was only barely edible.  The rest of it was set aside.  The gumbo fared no better.  The first bite in, hubby ended up with a huge chunk of gristle.  He powered through, though, until the less-than pleasant flavor got to him.  No more than half a dozen bites and it was pushed aside.Another twenty minutes now and the rest of our meal comes.  It looks pretty good, although I am a bit skeptical about the copious amounts of course-ground salt that coated the green beans.  They were pretty tasty, once the salt had been scraped off.  The chicken was also pretty good, if a bit bland and too greasy.  The ginger-sweet potato mash was good but watery.Husband's jambalaya was only barely edible and of course tastes nothing like 'real' jambalaya.  The biggest beef with it was that the 'sauce' tasted and smelled like a combination of heintz ketchup and the cheesy-tomato sauce you find in chef boyardee products.  He likened it to something out of a school lunch menu.With a $65 bill and neither of us feeling particularly full OR interested in eating more of the crappy food, we went and saw Iron Man, which was the one saving grace to what otherwise, especially once the food poisoning kicked in, was a spectacular disaster."
249,"The Catfish Dinner is misleading. You don't get nice pieces of fillet catfish you get catfish nuggets-the belly if the catfish! It's what the butcher cuts off of the fillet-the mis cuts.  In the dinner you get 4 nuggets, 1/4 cup potato salad, and 6 hush puppies for $15.21.  This place has set the bar for delicious creole cuisine so my expectations were high!  Catfish nuggets??? I was very disappointed."
250,"It's a great place for a date if you want to impress him or her. Not so much for the everyday.The food was good, but not so great after you looked at the price. It's not super pricey, but definitely not worth it considering the food. But, the atmosphere is great! It definitely feels like you are eating down south. But personally, I care a lot more for the food than the decor. Which is why I gave it 2 stars.The service was good, but not great. OH yeah! Please make reservations, because you will have to wait for 1+ hr otherwise...which is definitely not worth it."
251,"That's it for these longtime customers. Restaurant was about half full when we arrived but then quickly filled up on a Saturday afternoon. Slow to take our order and even slower to get our food. Folks who came in after us received their food before us. We were even thinking of paying for our appetizer and drinks and leaving because the wait was so long. When the food finally arrived, one entree was stone cold like it had been sitting around - someone wasn't paying attention. The other 2 entrees seemed like they had been sitting around too, got cold and were then microwaved to heat up. Hush puppies were overcooked. Music is way too loud to have a comfortable conversation. Too bad.  Used to be great and one of our absolute favorite places to eat. The passing of the owner and the expansion ruined it. Will not be returning."
252,"Not impressed. Based on the great reviews we went here to see what is all the fuzz and was disappointed as usual with most restaurants in Berkeley. The food is mediocrite at best and the service was amateurish. Here is why,The gumbo was bland. The salad dressing was too sweet. The fried chicken, which everyone raved about, was so so. The mixed grill plate looks good but bordering on tasteless. The BBQ shrimp were dry with a hint of Cheyenne. The links were mushy and bland. The Louisiana BBQ source that came with the grills tasted like something you get out of a bottle. Service was slow and seemed unorganized. Took 10-15 minutes before they took our orders. After the appetizers, another 20 minutes before the main causes came. Somewhere within that 20 minutes the host actually came and asked if we want dessert 'cause he thought we had finished already. Had to ask twice and each time the answer was ""We are a little behind"", but I can't help noticed that there were three cooks in the kitchen whom most of the time stand around looking bored. Great hint upfront. After we got the menu, the host said feel free to ask questions 'cause many do not even know what ""hush poppy"" is. How can they then turn around and proclaim that this is great Cajun food? One star for the fact they let you bring your own bottle b/c they don't have a license yet. The food is actually of a 2 star quality, IF they don't call themselves Louisiana food. The only thing Louisiana about this place is the Tabasco source on the table."
253,"I called around 9:40 to ask when was their last seating they said at 10 o'clock. I got to the restaurant at 9:59 a man whispered in the waiters ear that they could not seat me. I told them that I called and that they said the last seating was at 10. She asked what time was it I said 10 and showed her my phone screen which read ""10:00 pm"" . They walked away had a brief discussion with some one else and came back. I told them that my friends were parking and I was ready to be seated. Anyone who knows Berkeley knows it is busy and that finding parking is difficult. Long story short my friends got in at 10:04 they said they could not serve us food but could serve us desert. Why would I want desert on an empty stomach ? -_- not only that but why tell someone you will seat them at closing time and when they show up at closing deny them service. Very unprofessional and I will not be returning to this restaurant!"
254,"I probably never would have gone to Angeline's because I'm not really into Cajun/Creole food, however my favorite Venus was closed for renovations. That being said we gave it a shot and had a decent meal. I ordered the mixed grill, basically because they were out of the 3 other choices I had made - I was told this was unusual. There was a lot of food on the plate; shrimp, ribs and a hot link all sitting on top of a mound of orange colored potato / coleslaw salad. The ribs were dee-lish. I wish they just had a plate of those; they were sweet and sticky, could have been a wee bit spicier but still good. Hot link was dry but the shrimp had good flavor. It was the orange colored potato/coleslaw mash under my food that disturbed me a bit. Food doesn't have to be pretty for me to like it, I was hoping it was gross looking but tasty, it was not tasty. If Venus was closed I would go here again, definitely for the ribs and some other items that were not available that night. And on another positive note, the people who worked there were nice and the ambiance while plain was clean and pleasant."
255,"I came here after hearing many good things, but the food was a major letdown.  The hush puppies were kind of dry, and the gumbo was, well, fine, but not spectacularly delicious as I had been led to believe.  The honey butter that came with the hush puppies was probably the best part of the whole meal.  Despite being disappointed, this would probably be a 3-star review if not for the ridiculously slow service.  We were seated right away, and the waiter warned us that it might be slow because they were pretty busy, but good god man, we were there for almost two hours, when it really should have been a 45 minute experience - possibly an hour.  When he finally came to take our order, about a half hour after we were seated, I started asking him a question about the beer and he cut me off, saying, ""sorry, can you excuse me?  these guys have been waiting forever"" and brought the check to the table next to us.  Hello?!  We had been waiting forever too.  He came right back, so it all worked out, but I just couldn't believe he had done that!I wish I could give this place a better review.  The space is nice, and the people working there are friendly enough.  But the food just aint that impressive and the service is as slow as molasses - although maybe that's just what they're going for."
256,"This place is nothing but hype. Had bad service. No host even there to seat you. Waited for about 5-10 minutes, others wait longer and with no knowledge of when they may be seated. Moderately noisy family-friendly eating arena. However, the food was massively disappointing. Went there because of the rave reviews from Yelp.Sure, we'd like to support restaurants on Shattuck, but we'd also like to enjoy what we order. Prices are a bit much for the quality and quantity you receive in entrees. Appetizers seem decent. Food is very simple. Simple, in the bad sense. Deep fried oysters. ~$11. Wtf?! At least try to garnish or add a little color or something. Cheese fries for a little less, too. But that was ok. Still though, a little much for what you pay. Value is not so great. Had the shrimp creole and the shrimp was overcooked(too too firm), the dish tasted like sweetened, heated ketchup. Nothing interesting about the overpriced flavors. If the prices were cheaper, I would definitely come in expecting regular food with regular prices and nothing outstanding. Friend had the shrimp po' boy. It was decent. But DEFINITELY not worth the ~$10 we paid. It was comprobable to a McD's ""Fillet O' Fish."" Try it here and you will very wel agree. Decor is deese, man. Shoot. Nothing crazy. and Not much seating. If you come in maybe expecting not too much and just regular Louisiana cookin, you may come out satisfied. Otherwise, this is a no go. An overhyped whatever. I guess the only redeeming factor is that it is a novelty here in the Eastbay, this Louisiana cuisine, as this type of restaurant is rare in these parts."
257,"This place reminds me of an olive garden: the atmosphere and menu tricks you into thinking you're eating some worth-while food but then you realize how ordinary it is.  I was excited to try this place...it serves muffalettas! The key is the olive salad. I had one in New Orleans. The bread is supposed to soak up all the olive oil and spices which softens the bread and distributes flavor throughout the sanwich. If you don't do this then it's not a real muffaletta. They didn't do this.  My weak muffaletta was 11 bucks.Next, I stole some bites of the mixed grill dinner.  The ribs were cooked well but sauce was to sweet. No smoke...or heat...or tang.  Just sweet. It simply ruined the meat for me. The only highlight of this order was the shrimp, everything else is pretty unremarkable...besides the sweet bbq sauce. Please omit high fructose corn syrup (or molasses) from the recipe.That was 16 bucks.There are some redeemable qualities of this restaurant.  It's a really cute space and the staff is very friendly.  Yeah.... that's it.If you want to spend 30+ bucks on lack luster pseduo southern cooking, then you've been warned. The food I had does not inspire me to give Angeline's Louisiana Kitchen a second chance."
258,"I don't know where these people have been eating, but I just left having dinner there and Angelines is mediocre at best.  Must be a lot of Angelines investors or employees postoing reviews.  Food was OK, but had little to do with New Orleans cooking.  More like a yuppie fussion of what yankees think Cajon should taste like.  The food was marginal, three out of four shrimp cooked, one raw.  The crab cakes were good, but like everything else overpriced.  I like a  plain old CocaCola with my southern fare, but what I got was either from a bad dispenser or a cheap cola substiture.  A small thing but it led to the waiter telling me i should have brushed my teeth before daring to eat at Angelines,  not any effort to fix the problem.  Marginal food, bad service, I won't be back"
259,"What a disappointment. There we were, fresh off BART on our way to hear Irvin Mayfield at Zellerbach, hoping to grab a quick dinner before the show when we heard the unmistakable sounds of a New Orleans-style brass band on the street. Further investigation lead us to Angeline, a cajun-inspired restaurant with a wonderful band hooting away right out front. We let Fate decide our dinner plans. There are three great things about this restaurant: the brass band BRASSHOPPER, who plays there occasionally to lure diners in, and the hush puppies. They also serve Abita beer. There are two good things about this restaurant: the affable owner/host and the authentic New Orleans chops & artwork Angeline brings to the area. There are many lousy things, however: The service is abysmal and the chef needs to shut up and cook. We waited nearly an hour for our food and were late for the concert. Timing was way off. Other guests left without eating. There is only one waiter. The classic Iceberg lettuce wedge salad was ruined by a sour ranch dressing and no ""wedge,"" just leaves. The fried catfish tasted -- questionably fresh. The jambalaya was the red-sauce variety which leaves me wondering if anyone in the kitchen has ever been to NOLA for the dirty brown variety. Get it together folks, and for crying out loud, put Brasshopper on the payroll.EDITED: The owner wrote me a very sincere apology about being overloaded the night we went. I promise to revisit Angeline's and amend this review based on the next experience. Kudos to the owner who clearly takes his business reputation seriously. Try the hush puppies. -- Shira L."
260,"I went here with a friend from out of town and was considerably disappointed after having read some rave yelp reviews... Besides the bread pudding, which was excellent, our food was just so-so. The meat was on the dry side and our meals were under-seasoned.The location of this restaurant isn't so nice; it's right near the Downtown Berkeley BART station, and as anyone who's ever walked around there knows, it's not exactly the cleanest, sweetest-smelling area. The most - how shall I put this - 'interesting' part of our visit to Angeline's: a disheveled gentleman of the streets reeking of stale cigarettes, alcohol and urine wandered inside RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE OWNER, stumbled to our table, sat down and started yelling profanities... After much prodding, I finally managed to convince him to leave. The owner? Completely oblivious to the entire scene. I can laugh about it now, but it was embarrassing at the time. I'm in no hurry to go back."
261,"let's start off by saying my own mother referred me to this restaurant and being a creole young woman i was super excited to experience this restaurant on my special birthday. i called to make reservations because the website for angeline's stated for parties over 12 please contact the restaurant. i called and first spoke with a gentleman named jesse or something like that. he told me he had a large party already at 7:00pm and he had open the following slots of  4:00pm/4:30 or 5:00pm. i called back in less than 2 minutes and another man picked up. i told him what the previous gentleman told me and wanted to book a table for 5:00pm. he put me on hold and came back and first said he did not have a table to accommodate parties larger than 12 people. i asked if that was true b/c the previous guy said it was fine just the time i originally requested at 7:00pm wasn't going to work. he said well that guy was wrong and i am the manager. so i told him ok.. well you do know your website should reflect that if it is true. it only says for parties over 12 people call the restaurant which gives the impression that you can accommodate more than 12 guests. then i said ok, let's make the reservation for 12 people at 5:00pm. now 5:00pm does not work. he stated he could only do 4:00pm. after how uncooperative the manager  was and all the misinformation i received in 5 minutes from 2 different people. i was over it and told him i would rather spend my money elsewhere. i can only imagine if the reservations gave me this headache, i'm sure the service and food can only be worse. glad i dodged that bullet. now back to inform my mom and her restaurant club of food and service reviewers... silly manager... smh"
262,This place was alright.  I ordered a po-boy sandwich and didn't like the overpowering vinegar taste to it which upset my stomach a bit.  The place isn't a date place since the place is packed with tables which are spaced about a foot apart from the party next to you which was a bit awkward.  I liked the reviews about this place but this was just one of the hyped up restaurants that just didn't live up to it.  So don't believe the hype.
263,No good.Had the fried chicken and they only give you 3 stripes for what comes out to be twenty bucksKFC tastes about the same which makes the 20 or so dollars seem even like a waste
264,"I've now been to this restaurant 3 times and I really want to like it. The food is actually very good, a little pricey, but I love Cajun food! The challenge I have is that I worked in restaurants for a number of years as a server and I consider service a huge part of the experience I eat out for. The first time I went in with two of my friends that I do weekly dinners with, the place based was battling Gather as our new favorite weekly spot just based on the food. We talked enough that we weren't bothered much by the fact that the service was rather slow, despite not being crowded that evening. The second time we went in it was crowded, and we prepared for the half hour wait to be seated, letting them know we had three people and one was coming in a bit later. What they didn't bother to tell us until we were ready to be seated, was that they wouldn't seat us at a table for 3 unless everyone was present, something that could have been easily communicated when we told them our third person wasn't there half an hour earlier. So we called our friend and made plans for a different day, sitting at the table for 2 they would allow us. They were kind enough to give us an appetizer as it was obvious we were frustrated with how this was handled. So this one I can forgive and move on, enter third visit last night. Monday night about 5:30pm, hardly anybody in the restaurant and 3 servers. The service was painfully slow, I wasn't offered water, and my waiter spent more time talking to his co-workers than checking on his tables. Again, all this I can forgive (maybe he's having a bad day), but when I asked to have my leftovers to go and he plopped a couple of to go containers on my table and went back to talking to his friends, then took an extended period of time just to collect my payment and bring change, I was done with this restaurant. Bottom line is that if your crazy busy with tons of tables I can completely understand getting mediocre service just due to time constraints, but if there's nobody in the place it is basic curtesy to wrap a guests food and get to the table regularly and in a timely fashion, maybe even just for fun offer some water. So if you want good Cajun food, they have it, but I wouldn't suggest going here expecting the kind of service that normally should accompany the prices they are charging."
265,"If you've been to Nawlins, yer gonna be disappointed.  We had to wait a long time for our table, which we expected. I don't mind waiting for a really great meal. My partner had the voodoo shrimp, their specialty, and honestly, Pacific shrimp just doesn't taste like gulf shrimp, and the spices were wimpy compared to what you would get down in da quawta. Service was excellent.  I had the fried chicken. It was all boneless white meat and felt like a white-washed version of what I normally think of as ""soul food"". Everything was cooked perfectly fine, just not anything to jump up and down about and not something that will satisfy your craving of eating in the Big Easy."
266,"I enjoyed my mac & cheese, but my brussel sprouts were a little too charred for my tastes (if I want charred food, I can stay home and cook). When I made the reservation for a large group, the host said that we all needed to show up in order to be seated, and that our 6 o'clock reservation would be held for only 15 minutes. All eleven of us showed up on time, only to discover that the table reserved for us was not ready, and we had to wait till the people dining there finished. We waited till 6:22 before we could sit down. The waitress brought us two orders of hush puppies on the house to make up for it."
267,"The long lines outside this place is very misleading. The ribs were not falling off the bone..the sauce was just so-so. The shrimp po-boy was bitter tasing...like it was full of vinegar. I don't know if the people who eat here have never had good bbq...but yeah unless you try something other than what I ate, eat here at your own risk. Very very disappointed in the quality. Try loonies, or hit up Oakland for good bbq. Will never eat here again."
268,"It is with great sadness that I have to give Angelines two stars =( My husband and I loved the idea behind this place as well as the menu that tempted us online for months...we finally made it to Angelines last night and it just didnt live up to the hype (maybe self induced hype/excitement). I've been to NOLA and experienced real southern food more than a few times and I would say that the menu is very southern/new orleans but it just wasn't that good. Hush puppies were good but not over the top. My voo doo shrimp were overcooked (read: hard) and the sauce they came in was good but not great. Brusselspouts were good but a little too bbq'd..would not write home about em. Hubby had the ""fried chicken"" which is actually chicken strips..no bone so it was drier than expected. I am sad to say I don't think we will be back...maybe for the bignets only."
269,"Angeline's is a place that i never pick b ut other people like to pick this place.  The four times i have been there the service was SLOW (like DSL turtle slow) even though we were like 1 of 3 small parties present.  Twice they have gotten the order wrong, once food had to be sent back because it was too salty."
270,"Great place to eat and chat with friends, but horrible seating and ok food. Pros: -Great location; one of the few places close to campus where you can take your parents to eat- Oyster Po' Boys + hush puppies are great if the chef is on top of his game (and does not forget them in the fryer)Cons:-food consistency. Since they've become so popular on Yelp, the quality control has started to sink. Anytime i come here, it's a 50-50 crap shoot on whether or not my food is delicious or overcooked (and yes, they still serve it!)  -the hostess. I didn't catch the name of the white woman, but she's terrible! This is a busy place, and a hostess should not be easily frazzled. I came here w/ 2 friends on a Sunday night. When there is a wait list, the hostess usually has a clip board on hand for people to sign themselves in. However, on this night it was missing. After waiting 7 minutes (yes i timed it), I went to look for her.  She then directed me to go wait for her next to the door while she continued to complain about a previous customer to the busy waiters.  Once she decided she was able to start working again, she decided to seat an incomplete party of 2 at a table for 4 when a table for 2 was available....the party of three that was ahead of us didn't look too pleased either..."
271,"I am not an expert on Louisiana/Southern cuisine, but I was in Galveston, Texas a few weeks ago and had some mighty fine eats. Tonight I had the gumbo and the crayfish. Not impressed. Lack of real taste was substituted by salt and hotness. The real stuff down South is not as slick, but they have family secrets that go way back.  Cruder, but there is some magic, even at the joints off the road. To me it seems like Angeline's has a recipe book off the web or something. Good ingredients, but no magic."
272,I am not that impressed. I tried the mac'n'cheese and the butter fried chicken. the mac'n'cheese was crunchy on the top but was too oily and not enough cheese. the chicken stripes were very standard and nothing special at all. The price was too much for that quality. I like the mashed sweet potatoes that came as a side with the chicken.
273,"I love this place and the food is great. I would hate to see this place go out of business from health code violations. But today I had a fearful experience....The guy they refer to as ""head chief"" and come to find out part owner stands n a window in full view of customers handling food while blowing his nose n the air ,sneezing, wiping his nose and mouth with his hands, runs hands thru his hair all while handling food. They say the food is cleaned and boiled after he touches it so it's ""ok""and his sneezing isn't a normal sneeze because he has touretts . That doesn't excuse poor food handling and violation of health codes. Yes he doesn't have a ""cold"" he has a horrible disease that I'm sure is very hard to live with and he had accomplished more then most people without a disorder. However, passing his bodily fluids"" spit, mucus and hair ""onto food isn't acceptable and should not be excused because he has Tourette's or that  he is the owner. No no he should not be handling food period that is disgusting to watch someone blow their nose sneeze cough wipe their nose while touching the food you are about to eat and pay for."
274,"So I called and spoke to representative.looking on it at yelp I wanted to give it a try for mothers day. So I called the representative who was very indecisive. He asked me question as if he was going to put us on a reservation list. I expressed how many people were in my party,what time we would arrive, etc..... he said sorry we are full. Your going to be waiting an extremely long time. I saw no point of asking me all those questions if that was the conclusion. So we decided to spend mothers day somewhere else... Really wanted to spend money there. Confusing customer service......oh to top it off on the phone person was the acting manager. Note to the wise: be direct and professional."
275,"What a big dissapointment after reading all the reviews about this place.  It does not take much to satisfy me about a restaurant.  I can deal with bad service provided that the food is excellent.  Well, Angeline's was a failure in terms of service and food quality.  I avoided the wait by arriving early for dinner at 5:30pm.  A long haired pony tailed middle aged Antonio Banderas wanna be was our waiter.  He was cool in the beginning but I would find out later this was someone full of sh*t.  We ordered hushppies for appetizer and I had the fried chicken and my wife had the mixed grill.  When the hushppies arrived we immediately tasted how salty it was. I mean all I tasted was salt.  They must have salted these hushpuppies twice.  We could not eat it.  When my wife's mixed grill showed up it looked pretty appetizing but when my wife took a bite of her shrimp she said it was cold.  So I took a piece and sure enough these shrimps were cold and it felt like it just came out of a refrigerator. When Banderas came to our table we told him how the shrimp was cold and he gave me a BS explanation on how the shrimp cannot be served room temperature because it can be a health hazard.  WHAT?  This is suppose to be grilled.  The sausage that came with her order looked dry and its been grilled a few hours ago and was heated in the microwave.  My fried chicken was good but  I dont understand why they use such small plate that my fried chicken was sitting on top of my mushy sweet potato that it made the chicken soggy.  Well I was still being optimistic and maybe the dessert will make up for this so far dissapointing experience.  When Banderas showed up I said I will have the bread pudding and he said that they did not have any bread pudding and he recommends the beignents since it just came out of the oven.  What oven?  Don't  you fry beignets?    These are doughnuts without holes.  What is Banderas talking about?  I did not want beignets since I wanted something baked instead of fried since we have nothing but fried stuffs so far.  If you put something on a menu, a great restaurant will always make sure you have it available specially at 5:30pm. I will not be coming back here and also will not recommend this place to any of my friends.  I was looking for that something special that made this place a Yelp favorite but I did not find it when I was there."
276,"The best thing about going to this restaurant was the parking space we got right in front of the restaurant. That was a miracle.We had reservations for 8:00, but they were REALLY busy with no tables free at 8, so we told the host that we'd wait outside and he said he'd let us know when our table was free. We waited... and waited... and waited. Then around 8:25, the host came out to tell us that our table would be ready in ""3 minutes"".Then we waited some more.After about 10 minutes, we were getting really restless, not to mention the fact that our friend (who is almost 8 months pregnant) was having a hard time standing for so long...Finally, my husband noticed that the host seated another group that had arrived WAY after us (and without a reservation) and our friend decided to go inside to ask what was happening. The host admitted that he forgot about us and seated the other people at our table. That's pretty bad considering that a host usually has a list and just goes down the list...Anyway, at 8:40, we finally got into the restaurant when the host asked a couple who were seated at a table for 4 to move to a table for 2. So by then we were really hungry. The hush puppies are pretty good. I don't know if they are authentic or not. The red beans and rice tasted good, although it was a lot more ""soupy"" than other ones I've tried.I had the Voodoo Shrimp which was decent and not dry, like other BBQ shrimp can be. Plus, they were covered with a sort of sweet, brown sauce.My husband had stomach trouble after the fried chicken. Maybe he's just not used to having food THAT fried.Our only other complaint was that we had to wait a while for our food. Oh, and my friend asked if she could substitute mashed sweet potatoes for the Cajun fries that came with her steak, but the waiter said that substitutions were not allowed. Then, about 20 minutes later, the waiter came back to tell us that they ran out of Cajun fries (which we also ordered as a side dish) and would it be OK if they substituted mashed sweet potatoes for the Cajun fries with the steak... So much for ""no substitutions""!The desserts sounded good, but I can't say much about them because, after a meal that cost about $100 for 4 people (before tip) that was not that memorable, we decided not to order any sweets.Other people rave about this place, so it must just be really inconsistent. I don't think I'll be back."
277,"Atmosphere was good, service was mediocre (they didn't bother to refill my drink, wouldn't let me swap out a side-item)Went here and ordered the ribs and fried chicken. Ribs were not cooked correctly. Ribs should be slow cooked in order to turn the collagen into gelatin. I didn't care for the BBQ sauce, it was not sweet or spicy, and smelled like soy sauce.Chicken was fried white meat chicken planks. I am not sure what they call fried chicken here in California, but where I have lived fried chicken is half-breasts, thighs or drumsticks. I expected to get one of each for what I paid, even at a ""high end"" restaurant.  The green beans at least were genuinely good.The dishes had nice presentation, but were way overpriced for what I got. For example, you can order the ribs lunch, which comes with potato salad for $16, or the ribs by themselves for $10 (which is a fair price for good ribs), ie, you are paying $6 for (75 cents worth of) potato salad. I hate potato salad and didn't try it. Maybe they put gold leaf or truffles in it, justifying the price; who knows.Final verdict: Average food for an outstanding price."
278,"Go to New Orleans, LA then come back to eat here. This is totally NOT cajun or n'awlins!  Their Jambalaya is not Jambalaya.  Anyone who lives in N'Awlins know better not to eat there.  ""PFFFFF"" is what I said to my fiancee, ""dis ain't cajun!"""
279,"Very disappointed. We read some of the reviews on yelp before deciding to try this place out and thought that maybe the others who had left comments about the service may have had higher standards than we do. This was absolutely not the case. We were seated at 8pm after a short wait for a table, but were not helped until 8:15. We placed our entire order with the waiter who seemed friendly and attentive, to only wait another 20 minutes for our drinks (which they got wrong) and another 15 minutes for our appetizer. Granted, the place was quite busy being a Saturday night, but it appeared that there were only  two waiters covering the entire restaurant. To exacerbate our frustration, a couple who were seated 20 minutes after us received their entrees almost 30 minutes before we did. We couldn't figure this out as we ordered standard menu items with no special requests. We finally received our entrees at 9:20 after deciding to stay (I was pushing for a walk out to go down the street for a slice of pizza due to my hunger, but my better half desired her Shrimp Creole, so we stayed). Once our food arrived, the Jambalaya I ordered was cold! I was fearful of sending it back not knowing how long it would take to heat up, but the staff was quick at solving the issue. Ambiance wise, we were sat in a cramped space where we were forced to listen to the details of dining companions conversations. On the whole, I would not recommend this place to anyone. The service is very poor and obviously something they are not rushing to correct. The food was alright (After it had been reheated) and my girlfriend seemingly enjoyed her shrimp (not sure if her hunger had anything to do with it...) After I posted this review, the owner contacted me and apologized for the poor customer service. He noted that this particular night had been busier than usual due to a basketball game at Berkeley and that we had arrived at the height of their dinner rush. He stands by his staff and stressed that this was not the norm. I am very appreciative of his efforts to reach out to us to explain the extenuating circumstances surrounding the evening. We will probably try this place again in the future and hope for a better experience both with the food and the service."
280,"I made a yelp account for this review. The service was terrible. Tables were readily available, yet I waited 10 minutes to be seated. Service in general was too slow, but lunch took 2 hours BECAUSE of the service. The food was good, but my party decided to tip him less because the service was poor. What infuriated me was that our waiter sat down and asked if we tipped him the right amount, asking for more. Appalled, we signed our check and walked out the door. I am looking at my bank account as we speak, and the waiter had the nerve to add more tip to the bill.INCREDIBLE."
281,"Maybe I'm harder to please since I'm from the south and spent 1 week a year in New Orleans for about 10 years straight but I wasn't blown away by Angeline's.  I also may have played it up in my head since I've been wanting to try this place for over 2 years now.  Or it could just be that the further away you get from a certain cuisines origins the less authentic it is. Perhaps it's just a combination of all three.We started out with an order if hush puppies which were pretty great so that was good sign but then when I went to order the crawfish etoufee, which is my most favorite cajun dish evAr, I was disappointed that I could not substitute (even for an additional charge) the side of green beans (I *hate* green beans) for brussel sprouts b/c ""they are too labor intensive""...what?  What does that even mean?  As my b/f said: ""It's all labor intensive - it's cooking!"", hehe.  So I settled on a side of mashed sweet potatoes at the suggestion of the waiter but I don't much care for sweet potatoes but I felt pressured so I went with it and while I can tolerate them they simply did not go well with the dish so I didn't bother to eat much of them.  The crawfish etoufee was packed with crawdads and spiciness (although I still added Tabasco) and would have been almost perfect if it hadn't been over salted.  My vegan b/f had the wild rice jambalaya and he didn't really care for it too much but he doesn't really ""do"" cajun food and as a result it was a bit too spicy for him and to me it was a bit too tomato-y.  He did love his side of potato salad, although they serve a German potato salad not a southern style one.  The only real upside for me was that I was able to get a Dixie pilsner which I hadn't had in years.  We did get the benigets but it appeared to me based on the box next to the wine bottles that they used Cafe DuMond's benigets mix which I could easily get myself to make at home. As for the service...it was wicked slow and not very attentive.  Initially they brought my b/f the meaty jambalaya instead of the wild rice version so we had to wait for them to make him the correct one.  The hostess was very very nice and chatty though but again, overall, not impressed."
282,"Angeline's, I f***in hate you. I would not wish your crap-sh*t service upon my worst enemy.Sure, your sweet tea is diabetes-inducingly good. Sure, your fried chicken with sweet potato mash and zuchinni was succulent and tasty. Sure, I would have given you 4 stars based on my first two visits (-1 for consistently burnt hush puppies). I LIKED you, Angeline's! I recommended you! But you've burned me, and once bitten, twice shy.You made my party of three wait 20 minutes in your doorway while there were four open tables. After we were seated, you didn't send a waiter with menus for another 10. You took our orders a bloody 15 minutes later. We saw a couple who had come in AFTER us eat and leave before our food even arrived. You served two of us, and after waiting patiently for the third entree (for another 10 minutes), you told us another waiter had ""stolen"" it. ""What?!"" we asked incredulously, only to learn that it had been served to another table. After an angry meal (you know, the kind of anger that makes you fume and apparently shuts off all taste receptors), you refuse to comp us anything (anything!) for the horrible service.Screw you, Angeline's. The last time I was this angry was over an ex-boyfriend. I don't need this from a restaurant."
283,"What a sad, sad disappointment.  2 stars to them for looking so good on paper, but failing to deliver.  I was sitting here trying to think of excuses to give this place more stars, but I just... couldn't... do... it.  And lord knows I wanted to have a good Southern/ Creole restaurant to turn to when my ribs need stickin to.  This place ain't it.My hunny and I checked out Angeline's last night, waltzed in around 8pm and placed an order for: Strawberry Lemonade, Hush Puppies, Fried Cheese Grits with Crab Etoufee, Country Ranch Salad, and Gumbo.  Nothing was tasty.  It was all edible, sure, I didn't feel like they were trying to poison me or anything, but it didn't make me happy at all to eat it.  Actually, after awhile, I started to really resent the incredibly bland crab etoufee and bizarre-tasting, watery gumbo.  These dishes are an insult to the rich, flavorful, dynamic Southern cuisine that I am honored to have tasted in my lifetime.  The Country Ranch Salad was soggy.  The lettuce was all flaccid and soft and just laying there with boring sauce on it.  So sad.  Sure, they sell sweet tea, but I can make a killer sweet tea at home for the price of 3 tea bags and 2 cups of sugar.  What's that, 25 cents for 6 cups of sweet tea?  I could make a fortune.Service wasn't all that great at ALK because our poor server had to work the entire restaurant alone.  He was a sweet guy, though, I liked him.  But I'm not giving Angeline's mediocre stars for service, I'm giving them 2 stars for the boring, tasteless food.  That's right, I said it.  Boring.  Tasteless.  Food."
284,"I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was with my experience here today. I LOVE quality southern food. LOVE IT. I have been meaning to try this place since it opened and finally made it there for lunch with 3 friends today. We arrived at 12:15, to the restaurant about half full and were seated promptly and brought water. Our waiter came back a few minutes later and took our drink and food orders. Everything seemed ok so far.We then sat there for a good 20-25 minutes, waiting for our drinks to arrive. We watched him seat table after table, bringing them drinks (and in one case even their meals) while forgetting ours. I think he finally caught our stares after walking by the table numerous times and brought us our drinks with a very brief ""sorry these took so long"". What became infuriating was that after forgetting our drinks...it seemed our entire order was forgotten as well. We watched at least 5 or 6 different tables, all of whom were seated and ordered well after us, receive their lunches. If it had been a case where people were receiving soup before our Po'Boys etc., I could understand....but we watched table after table receive the exact same items we had just ordered. There was apparently some serious drama going on in the kitchen as well during our lunch. While waiting for our food to arrive, we watched the main cook yelling at the female waitress and mumbling how he was trying to be a professional and her not telling him how many of something was needed. After about 50 minutes of waiting, we saw 4 plates sitting on the counter that we were sure were finally ours....nope, those were whisked away to yet another table seated after us. Right after those plates were removed, the cook slammed down a pan or two and stormed out of the kitchen kicking the back door on the way. No one seemed too concerned about the flames that began rising from the stove. One of my friends and I looked at each other and figured that was it, we weren't eating lunch today. Right as we were about to get up and leave, the cook finally returned, slammed another pot or two around and tossed out what had burned on the stove. About 10 minutes later, a good hour after ordering, we received our food.The Po'Boy I had was pretty good I will say, though not to die for. Sadly though, both the Gumbo and Jambalaya left something to be desired. Neither had any spice to them at all, which was extremely disappointing. The Hush Puppies were also a little overcooked. I love a nice golden brown outside and these were bordering on blackened/burnt. While a couple of us had been craving dessert early on, we passed this time as we had already well overrun the hour we had planned for our lunch excursion.I was extra frustrated with this dining experience as it almost mirrored my worst dining experience ever at this restaurant called Bite in Chicago, where in a cafe of 12 or so tables we were completely ignored by waiters for over an hour and then served cold food. Nothing rubs me wrong when dining out, more than a waiter who goes out of their way to ignore you when they know their service has been less than satisfactory. Something as simple as stopping by to say ""I'm really sorry your food is taking so long, XYZ happened, I'll get it to you soon"" goes such a long way with me. I honestly wouldn't even care if the waiter told me he somehow lost my order ticket and had just submitted it, as long as he came by and apologized and let me know why my food was taking so long. I'm not looking for free food, I just want to know why my order is taking 2-3 times longer than anyone elses. I understand people have off days. This game that some waiters seem to play where they put blinders on to tables they know are unhappy with the wait is just not acceptable.Reading through these reviews, it seems like a lot of people have ok experiences there, but also that my experience doesn't appear to be a total fluke. All in all, I might someday get a Po'Boy for a takeout order if someone else was picking it up for me from Angeline's, but I definitely won't be returning to this place anytime soon and would steer my friends away from visiting.Oh how I long for the days when La Bayou was great."
285,"Ok, either we came on an off night, or this place isn't as good as Yelp makes it out to be.  I lived in the south for many years and so I know what good traditional southern cooking is.  We ordered hush puppies, gumbo, jumbalaya and muffelata.  I also ordered a sweet tea since it's rather hard to get that in CA.  First off, the ""sweet tea"" tasted more like raspberry ice tea, not like the tea you get in the south.  The hush puppies were decent, but a bit overcooked.  They were almost burned on the outside.  Gumbo by far was the highlight of the meal.  Best restaurant gumbo I've had.  The jumbalaya, again, was overcooked.  I was debating between that and the muffelata and after tasting my boyfriends I was glad I stuck with the muffelata.  The rice was so overcooked it really destroyed the dish.  To me, it was a bowl of mush.  Decent flavor, but mush.  The muffelata...eh.  I'm used to them being served on foccacia bread and oozing with the olive mixture.  This was served on a toasted hamburger bun and very little of the mixture.  This place was packed when we arrived around 7pm on a Sunday night.  The line was out the door, but surprisingly we waited no longer than 30 minutes to be seated.  It's very small and cramped inside.  The hostest was very nice, but our server needed some people skills.  Overall, we were disappointed after reading such rave reviews."
286,"I give it two stars for just having sweet tea. Oh how I love you sweet tea.  Someone take me back to Georgia! The first cup of sweet tea was pretty decent because I love having a tinge of sugar and having the bitterness of the tea kick in. But after ASKING the waiter to give us a refill, the sweet tea was way too sugary this time. If this place is really trying to be a more $15-$20 type restaurant they really need to work on matching the decor to the food. I really don't think that serving Louisiana food and trying to be upscale works for them. The waiters wearing white shirts and the walls trying to be high class southern just really didn't match the food that was being served. Sure they tried to dress up their dishes with garnishes and mini vegetables with their salads but it just doesn't mesh well. The lighting in the restaurant is a bit weird. Some parts are really dim and other parts are well lit. The tables for two are very crammed, but it may due to the small space and that's usually found in most restaurants in Berkeley. There were people seated two tables from us but we could hear everything they said and it kind of got really annoying. One girl was constantly on her cell phone. People really do need to learn restaurant etiquette. I even overheard the girl that was talking on the cellphone comment on sweet tea. She was bashing on sweet tea! HOW DARE SHE! She kept saying how she prefers unsweetened! You know why lady?? Because you're from California and California only serves iced tea. Iced tea is the stupidest idea ever. Trying to sweeten your tea that is chilled! Do you really think that sugar dissolves in cold drinks? Ugh!@)(#*!@(*#&!The service was really slow or rather just bad. Right when we got in there was no host and even though there was literally only two tables occupied, the waiter took his leisurely time to have us seated. Once the waiter got our orders and after being served he never came once to ask us if we needed anything. ONLY when we looked finish did he come by and took another few minutes to come again to our table and that is when I personally asked for our refills. I was waiting to get my sweet tea refilled 30 minutes ago! Took another couple of minutes until he came by when I had to ask for the dessert menu. I shouldn't have to ASK!! Come on!!! Hush puppies were okay. More bready then I expected and the sauce just didn't seem to work well with it. My friends shrimp po'boy was actually decent, but she didn't feel that it was worth $11. I like shrimp. Cholesterol goodness.My jambalaya was a plop. The rice was too watery, the links were over cooked, and the sauce was very ketchup based. Very disappointing. The links did have heat to them which was good, but after eating a few it just didn't taste good anymore. The banana foster bread pudding was okay. A bit too sugary but it is a banana foster. If you want good bread pudding go to Gregoires. The beignets (there are 4) were served with way too much powdered sugar. I mean if I measured the excess amount of powdered sugar I'm sure it would have filled at least a cup! Very unnecessary. I even thought to myself that I could make a frosting with all this sugar. It tasted just like funnel cake and funnel cake always comes topped with powdered sugar. ha Also I think it's a bad idea to put all four beignets into one ROUND bowl with all the sugar on top. Why? Because if you are eating out of the bowl, the bowl tops over when you try to cut into it since there's to stability. Hence the powdered sugar gets dumped everywhere. I guess the waiter didn't know to serve us extra plates. But every time that bowl tipped I thought I was having a mini heart attack.Maybe I'll come back just for the sweet tea. Maybe.Side note: I tried to come last week but there was a private party that rented out the restaurant for the night. I was looking forward to eating at this place after friends told me that a southern restaurant opened up. And after reading yelp reviews I was very excited. But this poor girl was thrown to the curb that night and in the rain too! You don't know how disappointed I was. At least put this up on your website or something? I even checked it before going but it didn't say anything about being closed that day due to this private party. Shoot. What's the point of having a website if you don't update it?? And so today I called in to make sure that they were open. I really don't think such an instance should be necessary because why would a restaurant ever be closed unless it's a holiday of sorts? Shouldn't private parties be designated for private party rooms? If you're going to allow this to happen make a freaken area for it! Don't close your restaurant down and have people excited to eat here to come and be disappointed. Really this instance made be utterly sad. I was depressed the whole night. I guess it made me really ambivalent to trying it this week but I still had my hopes up..."
287,"wouldn't know what the food tastes like because my friends and i WALKED OUT. after waiting to be seated for over half an hour on a not-so-busy lunch hour with nary a courtesy apology for the delay, and having to deal with a charmless waitress who looked like she was permanently perimenopausal and who never even bothered to come over to take our order, this restaurant would not make it on my list. the wait staff at this place needs to be given a big whack on the head and taught the meaning of the word SERVICE till all their tiny self-important egos blow up. my friends and i ended up at Popeye's on San Pablo, where the service was far more satisfactory.just because this place gets 4.5 stars from 63 other reviewers does not mean it's great. this simply makes Angeline's the Sanjaya Malakar of the Bay Area dining scene."
288,"YIKES! I got the opportunity to watch a waiter cut bread, extensively pick his teeth with a toothpick right in front of the kitchen window, rub his nose, and go back to serving the bread with his unwashed bare hands. Food has previously been pretty good, but I don't ever need to go back to a place with the sanitation standards of a stadium bathroom."
289,"Had lunch there today and experienced some very bad service.  Slow, rude and arrogant, and the waiter had the gall to return the change AFTER he took 20+% for perceived tip.  No water refills, noisily clearing the table although the place was nearly empty, etc, etc.  I think you get the picture.  Two stars for good, but not outstanding BBQ plus trimmings.  There are places just as good in Oakland and Berkeley at about the same prices.  Maybe the crowds at dinner find this place convenient because of the nearby theaters..."
290,"The service was good and the overall vibe was nice, but the food didn't really live up to my standards of what soul food should be.  The food was just mediocre or a little less than mediocre.  I ordered the Fried Chicken, and I wasn't impressed.  When it comes to fried chicken, I think wings, and legs--dark meat.  Their version used chicken breast and it tasted like very fancy chicken tenders...but super drier.  The batter was good and tasty but the chicken inside was dry.  Well...I'm biased because I hate chicken.  The only chicken I do love is fried chicken with dark meat.  But there was nothing real special with the rest of the menu offerings either.  I thought it was just okay."
291,"I was so excited to try this place since It has gotten good reviews in the past.  My friend and I tried the Jambalaya, Shrimp creole, Hush puppies, beignet and their sweet tea.  The food in general was too salty,, the hush puppies and the sweet tea was just alright,  I think the only thing that was really good was the beignet."
292,"Angeline's is just alright.  But, since it's the only NOLA place in town, it has become the darling of Berkeley dining.In general, the food at Angeline's is hit or miss.  Their hushpuppies are great, especially with the honey butter.  The etoufee is nice, though the green beans are the real winner on the dish.  And the voodoo shrimp is pretty good, though the sauce pretty quickly overpowers the rest of the flavors on the plate.  However, the fried chicken has been soggy and dry (soggy breading, dry meat) both times I've had it.  More importantly, the gumbo and jambalaya are both seriously lackluster, especially for a place claiming NOLA inspiration.   Too much salt and too little umami make both rather inedible dishes.  The worst thing about Angeline's, though, is that the service is bad, and the wait is atrocious.  For example, on a recent (and final) outing there, my group of five waited for 50 minutes, before we gave up and went elsewhere.  When we first arrived, we were quoted a wait of about 10 minutes.  With a two- and a four-top in front of us, that seemed pretty reasonable.  And after 15 minutes the parties before us were seated, so we started thinking seriously about what beer and food to get for starters.  But then, a big tabled cleared, and instead of seating us, the owner seated a group of four who had arrived after we had.  We were next on the list, and the table could have fit us, but we just got skipped.  Then, a slightly smaller table became available, which could fit four, but maybe not five, and so another group of three behind us were seated.  FInally, after 45 minutes of waiting, a big table cleared.  You'd think, since five people got up and left, surely we'd get the table.  And you'd be wrong.  The owner sat another group of four, who had arrived well after we had to the table.  Perhaps they were good friends of the owner or perhaps he forgot about us, either way, we'd had enough and we left.  The sad thing is, this sort of thing is totally typical for Angeline's.  Conclusion: Until Berkeley gets serious about Southern food, Angeline's is your only choice.  Be prepared to wait for it."
293,"Went here last week out of curiosity and because of all the good yelp reviews.  I felt a little indifferent about this place.  The hushpuppies were really good...oh little balls of fried cornmeal...I wanted to try the fried chicken poboy, but that wasn't on the menu that night.  I opted for the shrimp poboy, this was pretty good, the shrimp was lightly battered and fried.  Not very greasy or heavy.  The pomme frites were good, but I would prefer them with less blue cheese, it's just a tad bit overwhelming for my lactose intolerant belly.  The sweet tea was...sweet.  We noticed that the owner, or at least I thought he was the owner, was going around and talking to everyone...except us.  It's not like I wanted him to come and talk to us, but I felt a little put off by it.  Was it intentional?  Is he some sort of bigot?  Haha...seriously.  Ok, end rant.  The food was just ok, maybe I will try again in a month or so and try something else.  But if you go, get some hushpuppies and some sweet tea.Update: 03/08I gave this place another shot.  I really want to like this place, but the owner/host is such a tool.  It was a weeknight and the place was not packed and no one else was waiting.  Well, it took a minute for him to acknowledge us, then he made a big deal about seating us at a four top.  There was an available 2 top, so I don't know why he made such a big deal about it.  Lame.  Then the server took a while to take our order.  We asked for water, and that was forgotten about.  We had to flag down the bus boy, who was actually very sweet and probably gave us the best service.  The hushpuppies were a little dark, but tasty.  I wanted to try the fried chicken the first time, but they didn't have it on the menu.  This time they had the fried chicken entree, so I decided to get it.  The chicken was crispy, but bland.  The spices were in the gravy.  But I wasn't that big on the gravy, but ate it with the chicken to give it some flavor.  The mash was ok, but I am not a big ginger fan, so I didn't eat too much of it.  The green beans that accompanied this were very flavorful but some beans were really soft, and some were not.  A little uneven cooking there. So again, I have been left with a heavy heart about Angeline's.  Too bad."
294,"I was very excited to try this place but a little disappointed at the end. I had the jambalaya and it tasted good, but (1) the restaurant is missing the authentic Louisiana atmosphere (2) our server (a middle aged man) never really cared about our table although he gave his full attention to the next table to us and (3) serving size was pretty small. On the other hand, the girl who was filling our glasses with water was very friendly and each time we needed our server she helped us to get his attention somehow. We had the banana bread pudding  at the end and it was not really like a souffle bread pudding more like a cake with some syrup put on it, I didn't like it. I might try it again maybe next year..."
295,cute place... portions good for me but not for my boyfriend....fried chicken mmm good but the gravy tasted like throw up with bacon in it and the sweet potato mush tasted like crappy baby food...(actually I would take baby food over it ehhhhhhhh! )i had to swap it for my boyfriends potatoe salad.... his cat fish was yummy but the hush puppies should  just be exactly that : HUSH ... ill probably never go there again... id rather go to kfc LOL
296,I don't know maybe I ordered the wrong thing but I had the crawfish etoufe and I didn't really like it. The only thing that was great was I ordered a port and the waiter let me try the different ports and he explained why I should get the more expensive one. He was right about it I ended up getting the more expensive port. The host was friendly reassured us that we will be seated shortly. The staff was great the food wasn't to my taste. The only thing that I did like was the penne pasta but its something that's hard to mess up. I prefer Brenda's in San Francisco to Angeline's.
297,"I liked this place until Saturday.  A friend, my child and I decided to go there for a bite to eat Saturday evening.  We walked in and there were two groups in front of us.  The first group walked away and the second group talked to the greeter for a while, she introduced his mate to the other greeter, they talked a while longer then the couple walked away.  It's our turn.  We meet the greeter, she is holding her Ipad and asks how many and says ""give me a second while we get a table ready.""  She goes over to a table and is standing there.  She comes back over and is looking at her Ipad and the other greeter comes over and they start talking, no one has said anything to us as of yet, then they move to the other side of the room to continue talking.  Fifteen minutes later, she comes over and says, ""your wait is going to be about 1 1/2hrs.""  Wait, what just happened?  What happened to getting the table ready?  What happened to having your handy Ipad to see if there was anything available and if there were reservations before us?  Why could this not have been told to us before we stood there for 15min?  I thought it very unprofessional and rude that you have people standing there, with no one in line before them, to tell them they now have a 1 1/12hr wait for a table."
298,"Yes, the fried chicken was tasty.  But it was so NOT WORTH the TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  We had to wait over an hour for our food after ordering.  The potatoes were lukewarm and the green beans were COLD.  We had to wait over 45 minutes after requesting to get the bill multiple times!  When I complained to the owner about having to wait so long for the bill, he was extremely rude.  I have never experienced such POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.   It was astonishing.   I will never eat here again as I refuse to support businesses with poor service and business owners who are rude to their customers."
299,"Last month I took my cousin and sis-in-law out to dinner.  I had heard great things about Angelines, so we decided to give it a try.  I have never, ever, ever been made to feel as uncomfortable as I felt that night.  From the moment we stepped in the front door, the host and employees at Angelines watched us as if we were going to rob the place.  Let me be clear, we are three attractive women, who make good money, working in good, white collar jobs.  We look, dress and act the part - trust me.   When I went to the restroom, I was watched closely.  When we were seated, we kept receiving looks from the employees and the host kept finding reasons to stop by our table to give us ""so-called"" tidbits on New Orleans cuisine.  Our waitress was quite nice, but it was a forced niceness, if you know what I mean.  We felt like they wanted us to eat and get the hell out.  After looking around and discovering that we were the only black patrons in the joint, we started to believe that it was a race thing.  After reading other reviews, I'm not so sure.  Maybe it was just really bad customer service.  I don't know why we were made to feel uncomfortable, but it was a really strange experience.  Oh yeah, the food was freakin' fantastic!  Unfortunately, the overall experience was so uncomfortable that I'll never go back."
300,"This place is over rated.  The female waitress we had was horrible.  She told us to hold and gave us the hand several times.  Sorry, but saying it with a smile doesn't mask your rudeness.  She asked how we were doing and then walked away mid response.  She seemed more pre-occupied with helping a much larger table.  She called us 30-something females ""girls"" and treated us like such.  The catfish entree which several fellow Yelpers raved about was foul.  However, I did find a similar review further down.  I only received 3 chicken strip sized pieces of fish and for $14 that's a rip off.  Being that the fish was the focus, I was extremely disappointed with their portions.  I was excited to bite down into the deep fried goodness anticipating it was going to be like heaven.  But when I did I almost wretched.  The bite I had was entrail tasting and the fish was mushy.  I almost yarfed at the table.  The hushpuupies they loaded up on the plate was mediocre; you could tell they needed to change their oil.  I also didn't receive the honey butter that was suppose to accompany the meal.  I only knew it should have accompanyed my meal when I  saw others slathering it on.  The portions only appear huge because they load up your plate with potatoe salad, sweet potatoes or hush pupies.  The begnies were light and fluffuy, but you could taste the old oil.  The pecan pie was delicious.  For the price and service you're better off going elsewhere."
301,"Really disappointing food.  I really wonder what people are excited about.  Where's the spice and the flavor?  If I want bland food, I'll go to Denny's.Honestly, I wouldn't walk 5' out of my way to eat at Angelines again.Went for lunch - the Shrimp Po Boy was utterly tasteless - I mean if somebody put a blindfold on me, never in a million years would I have guessed it was shrimp.    And the Jambalaya was mushy and tasteless - how long hat it been sitting in the pot?  A week?My wife and I were tempted to leave after the first few bites, but soldiered on in the hope desert would salvage things - curiously, not even a comment from the server when 80% of the food remained on the plate - I guess too common an occurrence to raise any eyebrows.As for the bienets or whatever they're called, what a joke of a desert.  Next to tasteless. Having never eaten supposedly authentic ""cajun"" food, I expected far more - all I ate was barely edible, tasteless food prepared and served in a careless manner.   I read the other reviews and wonder if we ate at the same place.  But I guess that's why so many crappy restaurants stay in business - most people don't have a clue what good food tastes like - slop that was served at Angelines was disgraceful."
302,we were there friday nights the place was not pack only 5 tables wait for food 45 min the stuff always talk by their service area.other 10 min wait for the check. The sausage was over price.
303,"The stars are for the service, the food is great and I will only come back if I order take out.  The first time I tried, it was my fault for not making a reservation for a large group but they seated half of my party and then started to seat other parties, I was in the second half of my party and after waiting for 1 hour when the first half of my party was seated, we had to wait another hour to be seated.  The host had seated 3 other parties before I was seated, and it was because these ""parties were before us but then why would you seat the first half of my party?  Regardless, the food was great but the night was runied by the seating ordeal.  After that it was l very tempted to never go back.  About 2 weeks ago, my friend wanted to have dinner there, considering it was a small party of 2, i figured we'll be fine.  We were greeted by the host(same guy as last time) and we were placed on the waiting list.  there was 2 parties ahead of us.  There were tables starting to clear and it looked like our turn is comming up.  But then a few more people walked in and some of them were 30-45 mins late for their reservation and there were 2 more parties placed infront of us.  we waited and a few more tables cleared and another party was placed ahead of us, this information was given to us by the Host.  This was getting rediculous!  But because we waited so long my friend said lets just wait.  we were finally seated after and hour and a half.  Lesson: Make reservations no matter the party size, expect to wait no matter what!  If possible, order takeout!"
304,"I went with a friend who absolutely loves Louisiana cuisine because she once visited New Orleans.  After visiting this restaurant, I have to question her tastes, since she was loving the meal and I thought it was mediocre.  The first turnoff for me was that the place is not really family friendly.  I don't mean that they don't like kids and don't have baby chairs, but the restaurant is so small that it forces you to confine your kid, which is no good when you have a kid who needs to be free range.  The second strike against this restaurant- the food.  I ordered the fried chicken, which you think would be hard to screw up.  The chicken I got had too much baking soda or something that made it seem too bready and flavorless.  The flavors really never gelled for me.  My friend gave me some of her catfish and again I wasn't impressed.  There was no flavor.  We ordered the beignets, which was the whole reason why she wanted to go to the restaurant, and I didn't like it.  Now in general, i don't like beignets because again, no flavor except for sugar.  I like Krispy Kreme donuts better than I like beignets, and I hate Krispy Kreme donuts.  Anyway, I feel like my friend was more in love with the memories involved with the food than the food itself. It just seemed to up the experience for her.  For me, the meal felt flat.  And the Third strike?  The restaurant.  I kept walking past it, looking for it, because the facade wasn't as warm as I would expect for soulful food.  Then when we were seated, we sat in the middle of the restaurant, which felt drafty, even though we went on a warm day.  The next time my friend wants to eat in Berkeley, I'm going to recommend we walk over another block or two and go to Jupiters.  That place, with its heated outdoor terrace, has the vibe that Angeline's should aspire to have."
305,"Eh... I was hoping for more... I'm going to give it one more try, especially since the bannana bread pudding was really good."
306,"My bf and I ate here twice.  He forgot that we really didn't like our meals the first time he brought me here last year --but we were in Berkeley and hungry, so I thought I'd at least get some Boudin.  I've never had it before here, so I think it was a pretty tasty ""fancy-looking, cut-up with spiced mustard, and arugula leaves"" appetizer, but my bf said that he's had better.  He was curious about this place because he saw some great reviews, and being that his mother & grandmother are from Baton Rouge, he'd check it out.  The restaurant was always full or people, but our wait to be seated both times were ""not-at-all"".  The first at about 5pm, 2nd at 8:30.  I think the atmosphere is fine with the music/ decorations, which kinda make you feel you're back in NOLA.  (At least for me it did.)  --Unfortunately, I was let down by the dishes I ordered.  On our first visit, along with the appetizer, I ordered the Jambalaya, and he, the Catfish w/ hush puppies.  My dish had the thick tomato sauce, which I wouldn't mind, but the taste was a little ""off"" for me, so I had a lot left, but also found I didn't want to eat the left-overs (I usually eat my leftovers because I pay for it.)  My bf said that his catfish was cooked hard, but didn't remember that detail until he tasted his 2nd order visit:  the Shrimp Creole-- which (when I tried it) tasted like it had the same sauce as the Jambalaya.  (I guess they may going for a marinara-flavored type of sauce, but I didn't think Italian was so heavily influenced in Creole cooking as say, French and Spanish.)  So in the end, he picked out the shrimp, and left the rest alone.  Luckily, I had the special to share with him, so he'd not go hungry, which was the pork-tenderloin, with some special (I think bourbon) sauce.  He didn't care for the sauce, but I needed it because the meat was a little dry for my taste buds.  Maybe I shouldn't of ordered it because of the CUT of the meat, I don't know for sure.. but maybe.  What I do know is the sides (I love sides) were disappointing.  The creamed corned was ""okay"".  But I thought the green beans were over-cooked.  So did BF.  We like a little crunch, and this I think would have gone better with how it was flavored.  My server tried to ask the kitchen for another, but they said they were closing down.  And since no compensation was giving in the form of a free dessert, we didn't think it was worth it to remember what we didn't like about dessert on our first visit.  So, I'll just say, ""I don't remember."""
307,"Last year, I was kind of all about this place and would have given it a very high rating.  However, the service has been so bad that I just cannot help but give 2 stars.The first time I tried the place, the service was better than I expected (since most reviews also knocked the service).  Now I realize that the people at Angeline's (including the owner) just don't care about service to their customers!  I think the high yelp ratings have gone to their heads.I went in last Friday night for the first time in months and was really disappointed.  The food was just decent- we also noticed that the shrimp in the mixed grill was cold, but we were okay with it knowing that it's just the way they serve it- though I agree it's misleading.  When my friend and I arrived, the owner greeted us and told us he would be with us in a few minutes while they prepared the table.  He came back pretty quickly and started to seat us, but then stopped when other customers came in and said ""hold on, let me see what they need first"".  That doesn't make sense, wouldn't you tell them ""I'll be right with you"" and seat us first?  Plus he was giving off a weird vibe and giving my friend a funny look- not sure what that was all about.After being scrunched in the back right next to another table (I don't like eating with strangers, since when are we in New York?) the service just kind of fell flat from there.  We put in our order and I wanted to see if I could possibly substitute the green beans from the fried chicken dish with brussel sprouts since I had been eating green beans all week.  The waiter could have been nice and told me that they can't make substitutions- which I would have understood completely- but instead rudely said no and then told me I could order it as a side (which I could clearly see from the menu) and when I declined and told him that was too much food- he gave me a dirty look.  Fine.  We get our food and I swear, not once did the waiter tend to our table after that- we never once got a refill on our waters and were basically ignored until our plates were cleared and the busboy came by to pick them up.Anyway, I wouldn't give this place a 2-star rating just for this experience.  The truth is that the only time I had good service at this place was my first time there (and like I said, I think my expectations were just low going in).  It is overrated- the food is not THAT good, some of the dishes are too saucy (cajun shrimp for example) and the jumbalaya, while good, is not authentic like a lot of the reviews had said.  It will be awhile before I go back again, if I do, and I certainly won't recommend this place."
308,"I'm another of the folks who came here with a reservation and had to wait at least an hour for a table.  We probably would have left but the owner kept coming over to us and saying 5 more minutes.  So, fine, whatever - I wasn't that hungry - maybe the food will make up for the wait.  No such luck.  Yes, the hushpuppies were great, perhaps I should have orders 5 servings of them.  I had the blackened ahi salad and if blackened means burnt, then they did a good job.  My wife had the shrimp creole and like others have said, it was way salty and too much sauce.  It wasn't spicy at all.  All the flavors were simple and obvious and nothing was memorable.  I can see the potential here, but with poorly managed service for reservations and not-great food I can't see coming back here."
309,"The ambiance is nice enough but the food and service don't measure up.  The service was friendly but slow and clueless.  The overpriced boudin had no texture or flavor - it was like a bland, mushy Hillshire Farms kielbasa.  The catfish was small and insubstantial with little flavor.  The potato salad tasted like 1000 island dressing (not a good thing) and the hush puppies, while nice in texture, were lacking in flavor.  The food looked good and was prepared quickly - I just wish it tasted good."
310,"This restaurant should be glad I wasn't a food critic (at least a real one anyway).  My friend and I decided to pop over for an early dinner after work.  We walked up 20mins after they were slated to open for dinner service only to find the door locked. A waiter was pouring water for a couple sitting at one of the tables we could see through the window, so we knocked.  As we were waiting to find out what was going on a guy walks up to the restaurant who happened to be the Chef!  Um shouldn't the chef be in the restaurant well before dinner service starts, especially if it's not his night off?! Ok I was willing to let that go.  We sat down and the waiter gave our menus then left to get us some water.  He then informed us they were out of a dish or two on the menu.  Okay again not a good sign, but we went ahead and ordered.  After 10 minutes the waiter comes back with menus to say they were out of a few more things including what we ordered (the fried catfish with hush puppies).  They were out of at least HALF of what was on the menu.  Frustrated, my friend and I got up to leave but the door was locked.  The waiter had to let us out!!!I wanted to like this place but they made it pretty hard.  If you don't have a significant portion of your menu, you should just not open for the night and cut your losses instead of alienating new customers with lack of service and poor selection.  We ended up going to the noodle place across the street.**UPDATE***Right after my bad review I received a message on yelp (as have others) apologizing for my bad experience, explaining they had come off a busy weekend, and please come back, etc.  So my friend and I decided to go back this time on a Friday instead of a Monday.  Even though the house was pretty full we were promptly seated.  The host gave us his speech about this is good, that is good, save room for dessert.  I ordered a house salad and my friend I both had the fried catfish with hush puppies and potato salad.  I really liked the potato salad because it was surprisingly different from the standard potato salad fare.  However the catfish and hush puppies left a lot to be desired. The catfish was bland and tasted too fishy (and I mean fishy in the bad way) .  Honestly it's OK to add some Old Bay or other seasonings to your cornmeal before you fry.  Also the hush puppies were too sweet not the nice sweet savory blend that makes hush puppies great.  We also decided to give the food a last try with some bread pudding.  The bread pudding was decent, not rave worthy but decent.All in All I would tack 2 more stars on my review of Angeline's for a total of three.  If you're use to good creole/cajun cooking, know this isn't your grandmother's cooking or what you're use to.  This is creole food for Berkeley people that's why they get to charge so much."
311,We went to Angeline's based on a recommendation. I ordered the po boy oyster sandwich and it made me sick to my stomach. It was mediocre when I was eating it and then I felt like vomiting afterwards. The iced tea was good...so was the salad....thats about all. Wamp WAHHMP
312,"hmm. a lot of good reviews. i wanted to write a good one too because i -really- like this type of food. i was really excited to go. no dice. not so good. i had a shrimp po boy, oysters bordelais, tried the gumbo. all ok, at best. bland at worst. whats wrong with them? my mom is swedish and she makes better, more authentic gumbo. yes i actually know what im talking about. so, get it together people. strange, though, all these stellar reviews. puzzling to me. plus i hear its packed a lot. so i guess theres an outside, way outside chance they just decided to be bad for one night. this is one of those reviews where i was totally rooting for them. but i can safely say, its not very good.  i feel bad about this, oddly. but i guess thats what yelp is for, honest reviews. i like writing good ones a lot more though."
313,"Given all the positive reviews, we were definitely looking forward to trying out this place, but once we got there we were let down. It was so packed, that there was no where to sit so we ended up sitting at the bar. That wasn't really a problem, since there were two of us and we were able to get chairs with backs. What bugged me most was how sloooooow things were. We waited at least an hour for our food to come out and when it did it just wasn't all that great. The salad that we had as a starter was fantastic, but the po' boy main, not so much. All in all, I'm not sure it deserves the hype."
314,"I went to Angeline's for the first time on Friday.  I was really excited given my general love of all things fried and the reviews here on Yelp.  However, I was pretty disappointed by the quality of the food.  I ordered the voodoo shrimp, which is supposedly one of their signature dishes, but I found it just barely edible.  The shrimp looked like they came from a bag of Trader Joe's Medium Tail-off frozen shrimp, and they were overcooked, forming tight circles with a very firm texture.  What really killed it for me was the sauce, which had the texture and taste of flour.  The shrimp came on a bed of rice, but that too was made inedible by the sauce.  The side of green beans was ok, but they were just steamed with some shredded Parmesan cheese.  My fiance ordered the chicken, which was much better.  Also, unless you really are a fan of alligator, or the novelty is really appealing, don't bother ordering it.  I can't really see myself ever coming here again."
315,"the food was great, but this place has got to have the SLOWEST service of any restaurant i have ever been to.  i've only been three times, but each time, the meal and wait combined took well over 3 hours ... don't go if you're hungry, or in a rush."
