1,Overpriced - I only got very small portion for the medium sized make-your-own-bowl I ordered. It only filled half the box. It is about half the size as the ones that I got from other poke places.Very unfriendly staff - the staff was robotic and specially asked me to choose a tip amount with offering no meal service and a you-owe-me-money face. It is a self-serve place that you don't need to give tips. I normally gave 20% tip at typical dinner places with a friendly wait staff so I chose the 15% somewhat unconsciously. I hated myself for doing that.Food is decent. Hence the two stars.I don't think I will ever go back - that's all I can think about when I was dining there. And I went to another place for dinner afterwards because the portion was so small that I'd consider it as an appetizer.
