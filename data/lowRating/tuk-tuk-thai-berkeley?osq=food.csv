0,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
1,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
2,The food is not good and price not attractive compared with some other nearby restaurants. I spend 13 for a dish which only comes with noodle and shrimps
3,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
4,0 stars! This place is disgusting! We found a bandaid in our food and they actually had the nerve to say they would only give us a partial refund! Never go to this disgusting restaurant! We will be reporting them to the health department! Made me sick to my stomach
5,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
6,"I remember when this place used to be my go to Thai place.  It started going downhill a couple years ago, and tonight I was finished driving for Lyft, and this was one of the only places that was open or I could get some food.  I thought I would take a chance and stop in.  Oh my God, was I disappointed.I ordered the salmon with the green curry, and the salmon came out completely over done and dry.  I asked for a side of rice noodles and they came out completely over done and stuff together in one big lump.  I sent the salmon dish back, asking her not to throw away the vegetables because the vegetables were fine, I just wanted to Sam and replaced.  The kitchen ended up throwing out the entire dish, and then bringing me out a plate with just a piece of salmon and curry on it with no vegetables, and I asked them where is the rest of my dinner?  There was obviously a language barrier problem, because I didn't understand what I wanted.  Even the second piece of salmon wasn't really all that great, and the second plate of vegetables was under done.I just couldn't win for trying at this place.I'll never ever come back here ever again. This place used to have a much wider variety of dishes, many more noodle dishes, more interesting ingredients, seems to me like it's just serving the young crowd at the University who doesn't care what they pay and doesn't care what they put into their mouths.Some of us with more distinguished palates like me or not impressed.  This is not to say that the staff wasn't accommodating, it's just that the quality of the food and the confusion with everything in the amount of time that I spent in the money that I spent I felt were completely wasted and I'm sorry I came."
7,"That was the worst Thai food in my experience ever.First of all who charges gratuity when there where two adults, two teens, and 1 kid. Their menu description literally describes everything as something I would love. Sadly, I didn't love it nor did I like it. When I first walked in, the atmosphere was nice and spacious. What was odd o me was that there was only one table occupied during dinner service around 7. Shouldn't that be peak hours for most places? When we sat down we stared at the menu for about 10 mins. Our server Bird, came over even though it was obvious that we were no where coming to a conclusion on what we would order. So I ordered what I would typically order at an AUTHENTIC Thai eatery. I ordered papaya salad, larb, New York steak, pad see ew, and calamari. Oh yeah and two sticky rice.I'll start off with the appetizer, $10 for a plate of calamari. More like half a plate. No one can mess up calamari, it was OK. Try Racha Cafe's calamari a couple blacks away on telegraph. Makes this places calamari something in the past that you would never look back on. Not worth the price. Next was papaya salad. All the ingredients seemed to be right, but my one question was it ever smashed in a mortar. This salad is made usually by smashing garlic, peppers, and everything else in the mortar. More like they tossed the salad together. Sad, disappointing, and weird.DONT GET THE STEAK. $17 for cheap cut of beef and salty sauce on the side. & everything else was generic. I didn't see the authenticity in the dishes. You have all the right ingredients. Where did you go wrong? Must have been the cooking. I want to say something nice, I do. But my bill shouldn't have been $91. This place will never get another dime from me ever again. My recommendations: chai Thai noodles or champa garden in Oakland. Or racha cafe on telegraph. Now that's something authentic."
8,"WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE? I eat a LOT of Thai food, and this is by far the WORST Thai food I have ever had in my life.I wish I could say I was exaggerating. I'm not. It was disgusting.I ordered pad thai (how the hell do you f*%& that up???), hot and sour soup, and spicy basil with chicken.  The pad thai was absolutely, 100% flavorless. It literally tasted like plain noodles and peanuts.  Thank goodness I had some leftover store-bought pad thai sauce.  It helped, but not by a lot.  The spicy basil dish was COMPLETELY INEDIBLE.  First of all, I got it because, per the description on the menu, bell peppers were NOT supposed to be in the dish.  Turns out the dish was about 80% bell peppers, and that's all it tasted like.  Gross, overcooked, bell peppers.  The soup was the only thing that I didn't hate, but it wasn't very good.  The chicken was so dry that I actually couldn't eat it.  I have never even written a yelp review about a restaurant, but this food was so effing disgusting that there was no way I could let it go.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! Go to Thai Basil, or literally anywhere else. Gross."
9,"WORST THAI FOOD I'VE EVER HAD. You've been warned. I even gave them a second chance. Perhaps the rice dishes are edible but DO NOT order a rice noodle dish. The pad kee mao is bland as can be, the pad thai was SLIGHTLY better in terms of flavor...but when I tell you the noodles were literally like soggy top ramen bro!! Im not even exaggerating. They were chopped up and stuck together like one big rice cake. And this is a cumulative review of both times I've been. This place used to be decent when I was in college but I would suggest Thai Basil on Durant or if u want some bomb pad thai and you're willing to drive to el cerrito hit up Sa-Wooei. This place is trash."
10,"Most.Ridiculous.Wait.Ever.I keep wanting to give Tuk Tuk another chance, and they keep disappointing. Fook is okay, but definitely not for the wait we always have to endure to get it. Unfortunately, no more chances for Tuk Tuk."
11,We came to Tuk Tuk Thai around 10:30 at the at night it was a little late for me to be eating but I came for the desert the fried bananas which they did not have... so I ended up trying mango sticky rice which is pretty good the service was slow we had to find our waitress for our drinks for food and for the ticket but I will go again though maybe the daytime for their lunch specials
12,"I don't think I'll ever eat here again. The chicken was so dry, almost as if was over cooked. I ordered chicken pad Thai. What happened to this restaurant. It used to be good. I also ordered the mango and sticky rice and the mango was not fully ripe. I even asked if the mango was ripe and the waitress response was that everyone likes it. I should have taken that as a clue. I am disappointed. Time to look for another Thai place in Berkeley.Follow up: make sure you check your receipt to the original. The waitress tried to tack on an extra $2. I knew something was off and had to ask for original receipt. They had already thrown away."
13,"Friendly staff, awful food.  And no, they weren't busy.Tom Kha Kai: soup obviously pre-made to be heated up and other ingredients thrown in when someone orders.  Served luke warm with mushrooms that were essentially raw and bland, pre-boiled chicken slices.Pad Kee Mao: average tasting, with waaaaay above average amount of oil.  To say the dish was swimming in oil would be exaggerating....but just barely.Stir Fried Suki-Yaki: soupy and sweet.  Kindda like desert...except with chicken, shrimp, squid, and onion thrown in.Fried Rice with Fried Chicken: the only decent dish we got, but nothing to write home about."
14,"I called in an order through Postmates and was extremely disappointed. The pad Thai was barely seasoned and the noodles were all stuck together into one big chunk. The middle was still WHITE. I also ordered the pad kee mow and it was just as bad- no flavor, not even spicy and I specifically requested it to be extra hot. The flat noodles were also white and stuck together with barely any sauce or seasoning on it. All around quite disappointing, there are definitely better Thai places around."
15,"I decided to give this place a try since it was one of the few Thai places open past midnight and was quite disappointed. There are so many wonderful Thai restaurants, and this is not one of them. Their most popular dish fried chicken over fried rice was disappointing and flavorless. The fried rice was incredibly bland and essentially just rice, soy sauce, and onions thrown together. Most thai fried rices tend to have a sweetness that this one lacked. The chicken portions were also very small in comparison to the large serving of rice given. The Pad See Ew was also too oily and salty for my taste. The only thing this place has going for it is the late hours and the large dining area."
16,"Moo dang over rice (2/5) - it was pretty good at first, but the rice was drenched in the sauce, it was really hard to finish by the end because it was really salty. In addition, the meat was already seasoned with salt (the char-siu and chinese sausage), and also had extra black sauce on the side. The saltiness was overpowering and there wasn't enough plain white rice without the sauce to balance out the salt.The thai iced tea ($1 off if you check in on yelp!) was also really sweet, but can't really complain.Overall, the food was way too salty/sweet today, hard to finish. Service was really friendly though. 5/5! My waitress attended to us quickly. They were always available when we needed them, it made the experience very pleasant. The restaurant was also pretty spacious."
17,The food is bland and pathetic. Where's the love? The effort? The seasoning?
18,"So any person with taste who's eaten here before understands that this isn't an amazing restaurant. On a good day Tuk Tuk could maybe pass as a good restaurant- but what really makes this place worth considering is how late it stays open. When everything else is closed, you can count on Tuk Tuk Thai's bland, boring food to stuff you up enough to rid you of your drunken/stoned/sober munchies.Now, I fully understand that so I usually stick to ordering it online when I do, but tonight I decided to have dinner there because it was a close spot. Cut to a misunderstanding a waitress had in mistaking my order of noodleTom Kha (coconut soup) for noodle Tom Yum (not coconut, something else idk): I receive the noodle Tom Yum instead of my coconut noodle soup, politely explain the error, and have the soup taken back. In a 1/3rd of the time it took for the first soup to be prepared and come out, the second soup made her sloppy debut disguised as a freshly made coconut noodle soup. :-( It was very apparent that the chefs strained a good amount of the original soup out and poured some warm coconut milk on top afterwards because I could see the original soup rim stained on the inside of the bowl, the same clump of noodles and mushrooms from the first soup made their return in this ""new"" soup (and they had soaked in the flavor and broth from the first soup), and after convincing myself to at least try the soup and eat some noodles, I saw the first soup emerge from the bottom like a floating dead body I thought I had taken care of. I honestly didn't expect the soup to be anything spectacular, but it's been a long day and I'm more so upset at how lazy these chefs were to just pour some warm coconut milk on top of an old soup and send it back out. If I wanted to waste $12, I would've just thrown away my Bart card. Fortunately, the waitress we had understood the situation, offered to have something fresh made, and after I declined, ultimately just took the soup off the bill.Moral of the story: stick to ordering Tuk Tuk when everything else is closed."
19,This is easily the worst Thai food I have ever had and probably the only time I have actually not enjoyed eating Thai food. My Pad Se Ew had undercooked chicken inside which I immediately threw away. The restaurant could not have been less concerned when Eat24 called to let them know. What a terrible business. Bad food and no interest in addressing order problems.
20,It's too bad that the service here is so customer unfriendly. Prices on the website are cheaper and the restaurant refuses to match them even though they agreed to on the phone. Food is decent but over priced considering other offerings in the area.
21,"I'm not sure what happened to this restaurant. I have been going there for 10 yrs but recently their service has deteriorated. I ordered my usual vegetarian order that I have ordered many times. I ordered it for pick up because I was sick. My husband went to pick it up and when he got back, the dish was all meat. I called the restaurant to tell them about the mistake and instead of apologizing, they requested that I bring back the food in order to get the refund. It's a 30 min round trip and I felt that it was not our mistake, so why should we drive. They initially declined to refund it and they were rude. Finally the manager said he would refund it but guess what, he never did. Too bad, because they just lost me, and everyone I know for a customer. Very disappointing. I give them 0 stars for their poor customer service."
22,"So convenient, yet so disappointing. We've been going to Tuk Tuk for several years now. The food is sometimes adequate, the service is ok, and the prices are reasonable. Being only a handful of blocks away from our place, we  frequent it more than we would another restaurant with poor marks. However, they lost my future business yesterday. I ordered pickup, and when I got home, noticed a part of my order wasn't included. I called and was told I could either come back and pick it up or I could get a discount. What I really wanted was for my order to be right in the first place (this isn't the first time this has happened at Tuk Tuk). I returned, and then had to wait even longer to pick up the missing item because it wasn't ready yet. A feeble ""sorry"" was all I got. While it's still close to home, it's not worth the back and forth and crapshoot if the food/service will be good, or if the order will even be right. The good: reasonably priced food. The bad: the inconsistent quality and service."
23,"Been here twice and the two experiences were vastly different.The first time, I came in one night about 45 minutes before they were supposed to close, but the chairs were all up on the tables and the guy told me they were only taking to-go orders. That was fine, I only live a few blocks away. I ordered yellow curry chicken and Phat si-io. It took a little more than 20 minutes to get my order, even though I was the only one there. I paid and went home. When I got home, the curry chicken didn't have any rice with it. It's fine if it doesn't come with rice, but he should have mentioned that when I ordered it, so I could have decided to add rice, or not. The curry tasted good, but it's not the same without rice.The Phat si-io was a different story. When I opened the plastic container it was in, everything came out in one big, cold lump. It's clear they made it earlier in the day (I hope!) and stuck it in a fridge. It didn't heat up well, and was not delicious.Overall, I was pretty unhappy with my first Tuk-Tuk experience.I decided to give them another shot, and had lunch there today. The wait staff were both very nice and attentive, and smiled a lot, which is awesome. The Phat si-io came within ten minutes (with several other tables filled - why so much faster this time?). It was warm and good, but not great. It seemed to be over-seasoned. The fresh spring rolls were delicious though.I won't be coming back, but I'd say if you visited during the day, the daytime staff will do a good job for you."
24,"My partner and I love this place. Especially their soups. She always gets the Tom Yum and I get the Tom Kha. Both are always delicious. We order almost every week. Thankfully we no longer will have to spend so much money here now, since I ordered  tonight and got spring rolls that were burnt to a crisp( see photo). After complaining they said the best they could do is offer a %10 credit... so i got a $4 credit. Almost half off for nasty burnt rolls. Fuck you Tuk Tuk...fuck you."
25,The servers think they can just ADD THEIR OWN TIP to your credit card bill.  i posted a photo to prove it.  Look for it in the photos.
26,"I've eaten at Tuk Tuk Thai for years with my friends. This past Sunday $200 worth of jewelry was stolen by a worker at the restaurant. The food has always been good to me, but I will never support this business again."
27,"Nah. I once got sticky rice for like almost 3 dollars and it was not made that well. Sticky rice is hard to make but it would be nice if it wasn't so expensive for a handful of it. When I got it, it was very hard and almost crunchy. My yellow curry was good though, but it would be nice if it came with rice as well. So I ended up with average curry and a little bit of undercooked rice. The customer service was nice though and I did get full so there's always a bright side to things!"
28,"This place used to be our go-to about once a week, but over the last couple years, it has gone waaaayyyyy downhill.  I ordered online the pad thai and pad ki mao- both mild spicy, the spring rolls, and the bananas with ice cream, but called the restaurant immediately when I realized I ordered for pickup now, rather than for later.  It was 7pm, and I told the woman I had just put in an online order 1 minute ago, but will actually be there to pick it up at 7:45pm, so could she delay the order until then?  She said no problem, and when I arrived, I was actually there by 7:35 (10 mins early), and was surprised to see my order already bagged up, and ready to go behind the register.  I had requested extra sauce in my online order, which I had to remind them of (as well as last time), and the ice cream that's supposed to come with the bananas (which was barely existent).  When she brought out the sauce and ice cream, it was like one tiny scoop at the bottom of a medium size plastic cup.  In the past (about 2-3 years ago) when this place was actually decent, they always gave us 2 scoops of ice cream, which filled up the togo cup about halfway.  When I mentioned what a tiny amount this was, the hostess said that's how much they give.  Mind you, this is after I had to remind her to remember my 2nd sauce AND my ice cream, which she would have forgotten (has happened the last few times ordering).  When I got home, the food was barely lukewarm, with the fried bananas soggy and spring rolls not crispy, like they had went ahead and made the order at 7pm anyway!   The noodles on both dishes had zero chili spice on it and barely any sauce at all! The dishes were so bland, we had to put a bunch of siracha on it just to give it some flavor. Horrible food and terrible customer service.  You've just lost 2 awesome customers of 3 years, and i wouldn't be surprised if more were lost due to the lackluster quality of food and crap service. Too bad"
29,"The service here is horrible despite it being empty with it looks like 2 servers, 1 guy just changing the channel  on a TV only he is watching and 1 girl who I guess is seating people. I ordered extra spicy pork pad Thai and my friend ordered beef pad thai, my pad thai was not spicy but surprise hers was extra spicy. My girlfriends orders of papaya salad and chicken larb salad were  the last to come out... the salads were the last to come out and the chicken larb salad was brought when we were pretty much done. The food was average at best but honestly there are just strait up better thai places all over Berkeley with better food, better prices and better service. Best place about this place is the name."
30,"Ordered online through EAT24, was promised one hour wait time. Food came 1 hour 45 minutes later. EAT24 offered me $2 off my $25 order, which included a 15% tip. $2 is not much consolation. Bummed, but I got food, which is important when you are starving."
31,"Nothing really special here about the food, nor the service. The food was meh and just didn't feel like any effort was put in. The spice was not really there, and the service didn't ask how spicy I wanted my food. (which I feel is customary in Thai restaurants.) But the service was slow, and didn't seem to really care for their customers.  Honestly, I felt ignored most of the time. The nice thing is they are open late."
32,"Wow. This place is the absolute worst. Complete waste of money.  After almost an hour and a half, our food arrived, barely warm and partially cooked. The "" fried chicken curry"" was obviously a frozen chicken patty on fried rice, no semblance of curry... The Hot and sour soup wasn't Hot and Sour soup at all! A sort of spicy broth (I asked for very spicy) with undercooked vegetables and too-large pieces of mushroom.  There was more horrible indescribable food, but I cannot bare to describe it. Also our driver hung in the door way, asking for a tip.  I told him I tipped online, but still, he badgered us. Gave him a couple bucks, and he left. With a tip totalling $10 for $30 of terrible, late, food. Short version.  THE FOOD HERE IS AWFUL. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. DO NOT ORDER. PICK ANYWHERE ELSE."
33,"I just went there once for take away. This restaurant really pissed me off. I ordered a curry to go at 10pm. After I came home I opened it and realized that it doesn't come with rice. And they didn't tell me that while I am ordering! How am I gonna eat a curry without rice? If I have rice home, why do I  buy a dinner to go? And by the way the curry isn't that bad but definitely not good."
34,"You know when you get excited for 4th of July fireworks, and then you find out that City Counsel had to scale back the show because of budget cuts? You watch and watch thinking, ""Yea, the big awesomeness is coming...really soon now...I know it's almost here,"" but then it never comes? That's Tuk Tuk Thai. This place is just a big old MEH. They _constantly_ forget stuff in takeout orders, have so-so service, and the food is a 3/5. If they didn't even change anything about the food and just made things more organized, I would give them 3.5 stars. However, as it stands, I can't even justify a 3.The Good: prices and Yelp checkin incentives are good.The Bad: get your shit together, guys!Pro Tip: if you want rice noodles in your Tom Yum, you need to ask explicitly."
35,"Ordered 4 items for pick up, when I got home to find one of the items wrong I was not angry it happens, but unfortunately after waiting 15 minutes on the phone as the front desk woman talked to a manager (the manager was unavailable to speak with customers), they told me I could get a credit for the wrong food item if I repackaged it and drove it back to the store, well I'm diabetic so I had to eat what I had, plus I could not just leave again as I have small kids, horrible response to a customer service issue, been in this neighborhood for years, no longer will I frequent. Stuff happens but when you respond to it like this, yikes! Wish I could give zero stars. FYI Tuk Tuk, it's not legal to ask a customer to bring food back after it's been cooked by the kitchen, left the building, been opened in someone's private home. Rather than giving me my ten bucks back it may cost you a lot more."
36,"""We only have one delivery guy so deliveries are taking a little longer than planned."" It's 9pm on a Tuesday and I'm still waiting for the food I ordered 2 hours ago. My recommendation, hire another delivery guy."
37,"This review is solely due to the deliveryman (Asian male with glasses).  I ordered delivery via GrubHub today 6/11/14 around 10:15pm, and estimated delivery was 11:15-11:25.  I called around 11:40 to see if they were on their way, and only then had the deliverer started heading to my residence...which is a 5 minute drive away.The deliveryman arrived, 45 minutes late.  I gave him the money, and he tried to walk off without giving me change.  When I requested my change, he got in my face and demanded a tip, started yelling at me angrily, and refused to give me change until I insisted on it.  He finally dug out the change and violently shoved the bills in my face.And then he told me to never call for delivery from this restaurant again.NOTE: I usually ALWAYS tip delivery people.  This situation is the rare exception where I didn't because of this guy's nasty attitude.  I don't expect delivery guys to be all smiles and chatty, but the aggression and disrespect is absolutely unacceptable.My boyfriend was in the living room and overheard everything, and neither of us will ever order from here again.....because their deliveryman told us not to.  Trust me, we won't.   This delivery guy is telling people to NOT order food from this restaurant.  Not a good way to keep a business afloat."
38,"Since when did Tuk Tuk Thai start doling out fortunes in their pad thai? I found a unique message that had a barcode on it, and said it was made in china. most confusing! I thought my food was made in the kitchen. what are they trying to tell me?!?!Anyhow, my food was a to go order, so I didnt find the fortune til i unfortunately returned home. I had just started to watch Whitney, giggling away, and this shizz peeps out from my noodles. Unbelievable, I wonder what else falls into their dishes.If this makes no sense, please refer to the picture section and see the barcode paper from a strainer that was swimming in my peanut sauce. im not a finger in my chili kind of gal. never again."
39,This place is OKAY...maybe a little less. The food was pretty tasty but only because it was jam packed with salt... We ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice and the pineapple was clearly from a can...bright yellow in color and really sweet. The rice itself was pretty decent. Pad Khi Mao which was wetter than I am used to.. had a 12 inch black strand of hair stuck in our noodles! We had to have them make another which had less flavor and more wet than the first batch. The ladies there are really nice but the service is horrible. I had to get our own utensils.. stand up and ask them to take our order as well as bring boxes and a check. BEWARE OF HAIR.
40,"It pains me to only give this place 2 stars (would give them 2.5 it that was an option) but hey I must be honest.  Twice my friend and I visited this place and TWICE they did not acknowledge us standing at the front for an uncomfortable amount of time.  I mean at least say Hello, I'll be with you in a minute...  On our second visit, there was only two other customers so no excuse!  Oh well...shake it off. (Strike 1)We were seated and handed the menu and basically forgotten about...  It took well over 15 minutes to take our drink orders!  Really???  Shake that off too... (Strike 2)An additional 5 minutes pass by, we finally receive our drinks and the waitress is about to walk off.  Really???  We were ready to order 15 minutes ago (the menu isn't that extensive!).  Sigh...(Strike 2.5)We order and the food comes out fairly quickly!  That was a plus because we were hungry by this time.  We eat and drink and eat.  Food is quite tasty!  But strike 3 comes when we have to yell out and flag the waitress down AGAIN to order another beverage and refill our water.  She never came to check on us during the course of our meal.  Unacceptable...Food was good, but I'll pass on the service.  Won't give this place a third try."
41,"Thought I'd give Tuk Tuk another chance after years of chances. Got the New York, with rice and salad. About 3inches round of meat and the rest Fat! A New York is lean on the fat, not sure what they are using. Mushy rica and a rotting brown salad. Failed me again."
42,"My best friend and I used to come here uncountable times because the food was great! However, no matter how many times we came and spent tons of money, the servers would be sooooo rude!!At first that didn't stop us until we began noticing HAIR IN OUR FOOD and ROACHES on the ceiling. When we sent back the food because of the hair, they look at us as if it were our fault. There are too many awesome Thai restaurants in Berkeley, I wouldn't waste my time their again."
43,"The reason I will give Tuk Tuk Thai two stars instead of one is my past experiences here. I have frequented this restaurant for over 3 years, and loved it, because I could always come back whether I was a carnivore, vegetarian, or (now) vegan and find something on the menu for myself that was delicious. That meant my friends with any diet could as well.I'm going to assume that the restaurant is under new management because my most recent experience was such a disaster that I will never EEEEEVER return. The service has always been lukewarm at best, but the food always made up for it. During my most recent visit with my friend, gone were the familiar waiters and waitresses -- they were replaced with what looked like college kids from nearby UC Berkeley. Our waiter tripped over himself, never offering us water, and the kid who brought it (someone other than our waiter) almost spilled on us. We ordered our usual app and entrees, only to find a bug on our appetizer. Our waiter was so absent that I had to flag down one of the new waitresses who looked at the plate and commented, ""Oh my gosh, that's DISGUSTING!"" You bet your ass that's disgusting. She took the plate away, promising to bring another. We finished our waters and waited with empty cups, parched, until our entrees came brought by ANOTHER person other than our waiter. When he finally does saunter back around, he says, ""Aw man, I heard what happened... you know... with the food... that's messed up."" HUH?!Sitting there with our entrees and app (all brought at the same time), we kinda picked over our food, until they brought the check... our app was NOT comped, as it should have been, and the service was ridiculous.BRING THE OLD MANAGEMENT BACK OR THIS OLD FAVORITE WILL SURELY CLOSE SOON!"
44,"After making an online order for a bunch of people, (which took FOREVER) and going through the entire process, the order would not complete. Called the restaurant, ""Oh. We're not doing delivery tonight. We're short staffed""Would have been GREAT to know before starting the process."
45,"I've been here before and it's been okay. Not the best Thai food, but mediocre  However, my most recent trip( ie a couple hours ago) was not a satisfactory trip. I came here with a group of 7 people. So 8 people altogether.  We were seated immediately and given menus. However, our table was basically ignored once they seated us. My friend and I started making direct eye contacts with the waiters to get their attention. We would make eye contact and they would look directly at as us, lock eye contact with us, and then go help some other table. We were all ready to order after 10 minutes of sitting down, but after playing the awkward eye contact game, they finally came to our table after we physically wave them down, about 20 mins after deciding our foods. So a total 30 minutes after sitting down.We were consistently ignored after this. We got our food and ate in peace, but with no water re-fills until I flagged someone down after I finish my meal for a to-go container. Not during, but after. My friend ordered noodle soup and did not have much of it at the restaurant but was expecting to take it to work for lunch the next day. They took her soup away to put in a container for her, but came back with less then half of what was left in her bowl in a to go container, basically throwing away food she paid for. It took forever to get them to bring the check. I feel like I literally had to wave my arms like a referee at a national football game. Overall, the food is mediocre, okay at best, here but the service is crap. There are so many BETTER Thai restaurants in Berkeley with excellent food and excellent service. So why would you waste your time here????"
46,"I come here all the time to satisfy my late night cravings for food.  The sticky the with mango is also my favorite desert.  Usually I order take out, but occasionally my friends and I or my girlfriend and I come in and sit down to eat dinner.  The first few times we ate here the service was acceptable but nothing fancy, but lower than what I actually would have expected.  Today was probably the worst service my girlfriend and I have ever gotten.  We got here around 10PM on Monday night, right before my 21st birthday, so it wasn't busy at all.  We had our orders out and food came shortly after.  However we did not receive any customer service at all.  What's worse is when we wanted the check, the skinny Asian guy with the colored hair was just standing there in the middle of the store using his phone and not caring about any of his customers in the restaurant.  I eventually got irritated and walked up to him and asked for the check.  Then when he brought it over he walked away and continued using his phone and we were just sitting there waiting for him to take my credit card.  Once again his eyes were glued to his phone and I ended up walking up to him and giving him the check.I will definitely be coming back here as the food is good, hence the 2 stars, but because I work in the food industry and also give customer service and my expectations are high, I will not be dining in again and I shall only be taking take out next time."
47,"My friend and I found this place randomly through yelp and tried it out because of their late night hours, as well the intriguing tuk tuk set up in the middle of the restaurant.  We sat down, ordered, and waited around 15 or so mins for our food to come out.  We had the the pineapple fried rice and the Pad Khi Mao (drunken noodles).  The pineapple fried rice was really really realllly bad here, I could probably make better fried rice while half sleep.  It came out soggy and its flavor wasn't enough to compensate, (every person that's ever made fried rice knows that they should only used dried out rice in fried rice, and that's where I think they made the crucial mistake).   On the other hand the drunken noodles were better than I've had in a while and had a spicy kick that I liked.The waitstaff here were great the night we were there.  Our server returned to ask us if we needed anything several times and he never let our water glasses go below halfway (my biggest pet peeves are servers that don't refill).Overall, there are better Thai places in the area that I'd prefer to go to instead."
48,"Not agian!It's late we decide to get thai take out. I dislike their pra ram chicken. Never enough peanut sauce.  We get chicken satay- sticky rice and sizzling garlic chicken.  Taste was all pretty good. The sticky rice is already more expensive then other restaurants, but this time i only for half of a serving it seemed. I had to cook more rice when I got home. Find my photo in the album above . Same with the chicken satay. The chicken pieces were half the size they are anywhere else.  And the restaurant is about 25% more expensive.  IMO I'm stayin in Oakland for thai food . Bangkok palace you need later hours."
49,My first time ordering from this place and I wasn't impressed. Took over two hours to get my food delivered and then when the driver got to my house. He insisted on me giving more of a tip then the one I left with my card. I told him I didn't have any cash and he told me to just fix my card tip. I did because I was feeling pressured and I just wanted to feed my family. I will not return to this place and they didn't even got my order right
50,"I used to be a fan of this place when I first got to Berkeley three years ago. They had good lunch specials... a bit on the expensive side, but the food was tasty and portion size was good. It's generally not crowded either which means you get served quickly. However, as with many lunch places around Berkeley, the prices have gone up and the portion size down. I do not like the format of their new menu- it is confusing and misleading. I asked for the lunch special which listed PRAWN, SQUID, FISH on one line for $10. Then there was a bunch of sauces to choose from (the way they were listed on the menu was confusing too). I asked for the sauce which used to be offered on the squid dish on the old lunch menu. Apparently, that sauce is not available anymore. So I had to guess which one was the closest to the one I used to like, as there was no recommendation from the server. I pointed to the PRAWN, SQUID, FISH item and told the server I wanted that one. He said, ""You want all three? The combo?"" I said, ""Sure"". The portions were disappointingly small compared to how they used to be. When I got the bill, I saw I had been charged $11 so I questioned the server. He got the menu and said ""No, it is $11."" I pointed to the dish I had ordered (which was $10) and he pointed to the one below it, which said ""seafood combo"" and was $11. I think this new menu is very unclear as it appears that you get all three PRAWN, SQUID, FISH for $10. A minor point, but annoying. Anyway, I can think of a lot of other restaurants where you can get more bang for your buck. I won't be going back to Tuk Tuk Thai."
51,"Holy Jeezuz! The food was good, but, my guests and I watched in horror as a server inserted his finger up to the knuckle into his nose, several times, possibly scratching his cerebellum right before handling food and utensils. We couldn't believe our eyes, as this happened right at the counter where the food comes up. He continued to probe and wipe his nose as the evening went on. Later, I excused myself to the bathroom and witnessed another employee relieving himself, then leaving the bathroom without washing his hands. The men's bathroom floor was covered in urine and stank.The place looks nice on the surface, but for God's sakes, there is no respect for sanitary conditions. I wish I had gotten my phone video camera going. Unreal.I will never return here again regardless of the tasty food. I've eaten in Bangkok and had a similar experience. Beautiful restaurant, but the filthy bathroom was in the kitchen and the dirty dishes were in wash tunes on the floor in the bathroom! Disgusting...If you value cleanliness, safe food, and respect your own health, do not go here and tell your friends!!! What a shame..."
52,Over cooked meat in pat see ew. The cooking oil is used multiple times. Bad experience. Will not come back
53,"This restaurant is atrocious. I ordered delivery from a block away, 1 1/2 hour later received 3 containers of lukewarm, crusty food fit for the dog. Don't go here."
54,"Worst place for delivery. Gave me a delivery confirmation for an hour which is normal, but once they had not arrived at there set time I waited 15 minutes before I called. The first time I called the girl put me on hold but then just dropped the phone and never came back. I called again, then the girl said my order was still there, when I asked if I was going to get cold food the girl hesitated and said no, then offered to order my food first. I really am upset with the customer service and the delivery. It would have been nice to be called and informed that I was having to wait longer for my food."
55,"Went to Tuk Tuk Thai after a long day of work hadnt had anything to eat- ordered Thai fried rice and pineapple soul. Woke up Thursday with the worst cramps ever missed work...later that night diarhea began it didnt end. It is now Sunday and over 72 hours of no sleep or food, and a Saturday visit to the ER I recieved a phone call from one of the ER physicians. I have Salmanella Poisening. I use to love this place but will not ever return to such a place that mishandles food in such a way. If anyone reading had been around someone or simply had this themselves its truly an viscious attack on ones body. I woulnt wish this on anyone. Eat there at your own risk~but you only have to get me once."
56,Food is fine.Delivery is the worst worst worst ever. I rarely write reviews and I am not a complainer. But the last 3 times I have ordered from them I have had at least a two hour wait. This last time it was literally a three hour wait. The worst part is every time I eat there they have about a million people working there doing NOTHING!They shouldn't offer delivery if they can't handle it.
57,"I've ordered takeout from Tuk Tuk Thai about half a dozen times, and it's always been good until last night. Last night my order included some gristly pieces of fish that were inedible, as well as hard, uncooked pieces of potatoes and squash. It  was as if they had dumped the ingredients in a pot and cooked them for a few min to heat them up, then offloaded it to delivery containers and dropped it off. Last time I'll order food from them, even though I had also tipped them fairly generously through Eat 24. Big disappointment. Eating out or ordering food anymore is such a crap shoot."
58,"What happened?  Tuk Tuk used to be reliable -- the food was solid and the delivery was always timely.A couple of days ago, I placed a delivery order.  Normally food arrives between 45 and 60 minutes.   Instead, the food arrived after 100 minutes.  I was not informed that it was going to be late, so I had to call repeatedly during the delay, getting vague reassurances that it was ""on its way.""  I felt the woman who answered the phone (when the phone was actually answered) was dismissive and rude.Worse, when the food arrived, it was almost inedible.  Apparently somebody else is now cooking the food.  We had to throw the leftovers out a couple of days later."
59,"The food is decent, mostly.  Nothing special.Service, not so much.  I've gone occasionally for a few years now, and staff in the front of the house have been somewhere between mediocre, surly, and actively unhelpful.  Whatever.  Today service was just bad.My girlfriend asked some questions about ingredients, mentioning a food allergy she has.  Our server answered those questions.  Incorrectly.  He bluffed.  Bad fucking decision.  When our food arrived at the table, we asked again to confirm, because things didn't seem right.  His answers began to reveal his ignorance.  And he blustered.  Worse fucking decision.  When my girlfriend reiterated her allergy, he caved and went to ask the kitchen.  He was wrong, so he took the dish in question back, we ordered something else.  We eat a little and then our server came back and asked how we were doing, and made a lame joke asking whether we'd had any allergic reactions.  Are you FUCKING KIDDING?What a callous, shitty, ill-conceived, abortive fucking idea of appropriate customer service.  So anyway, that was special.  Our server demonstrated a blatant disregard for our well-being, and then made a joke about it.One star for you."
60,"This is fast becoming my last resort for thai food. I've been to this place 3 or 4 times now - dine in and take out. Their pad thai is dry, their pad se ew is mushy, their papaya salad is soggy and limp. Thai iced tea is overly sweet. Their pumpkin curry is probably their best dish, and it's still just okay. Service is nothing to call home about. From now on I'll be driving to Cha-Am for my thai fix.  Pros: open late. good happy hour specials."
61,Food is alright.But avoid ordering deliveries from this place. I ordered 2 times from them and I still regret the decision to this day. I literally lived one block away from this place and guess how long it took for them to get me my fried rice. 2 hours.Enough said.
62,"The last time that I gave a restaurant a one star review, it was because I saw a dead roach sitting on the plate.  From the ordeal that I experienced today, Tuk Tuk deserves less than one star. I called to order pad thai, thai iced tea and mango sticky rice.  After I placed the order, the hostess called me back and said they didn't have mangoes, so I switched it out to fried bananas with sticky rice.  They recalculated the order and charged me an extra $2 for the fried bananas.  I didn't feel like asking why it would cost extra, so I said ok.  When my order was delivered, I found out that the sticky rice was missing.  I called back, and another hostess picked up.  I told her that the sticky rice wasn't in the order.  She insisted that I didn't order sticky rice.  I then asked her why did they charge me for it (while starring at my receipt).  Then she said they didn't have sticky rice.  Then I overheard another hostess telling her that they did have sticky price, they probably forgot it.  I told her that I overheard her co-worker and that it was not cool that she blatantly lied to me.  She got flustered and put her co-worker on the phone.  Her co-worker apologized for the mistake and said they'd deliver the sticky rice.  ....time passed.. and the sticky rice never arrived.  I called back, and no one picked up the phone.  It is dinner time, they are open.  Probably just screening my call.  Thanks to Yelp, the unethical workers at this venue cannot hide from their poor customer service.  Lying to a customer, insisting that they did not order what they were charged for, then not delivering their item, and ignoring their calls.  I hope Tuk Tuk management reads this review, and REALLY re-assess their hostesses.  This is not a good way to do business at all!!  You have dishonest people working your front desk that are unethical and not trustworthy.  Shame on your staff, and shame on your restaurant for hiring such horrible staff!!You've lost a customer!!!"
63,"Was that Pad Thai? Or some sort of carnival candy?In a previous review, I wouldv'e given this place four stars for consistently good-textured, nicely-flavored Pad Thai. (This is maybe the fifth time I've been there.)What just happened? At least they replaced the Pad Thai. With slightly less sweet, but still too-sweet, still-overcooked-chickened, something.They didn't even have hot sauce on the tables. Someone mentioned this place being under new management.I just got taken to the most. miserable. birthday. dinner. of. my. life.I cried myself to sleep."
64,"WORST. THAI. FOOD. EVER.Last time I came to Tuk Tuk was a year and a half ago. Back then, the food was okay. Not great, but it was reliable, I guess.TODAY, I had the worst experience ever. The food was greasier than I remember, and the service was poor. I couldn't leave a tip. It would've been a waste of money, just like my dinner was.I want to vomit, and I had to come buy a tea at Starbucks to help bring it down because the food was too greasy. Save your money, and perhaps try Thai Basil down by Telegraph. They also try too hard to make the place look nice. I thought it was awesome before the hired new people and changed the look and food. It isn't... up to my expectations anymore. i didn't even want to stay for dessert.Btw, the fried tofu as an appetizer SUCKS"
65,Nothing special. Tuk Tuk is very Americanized Thai food. Many of the herbs were missing from classic Thai dishes. One positive note- they give plenty of food if your hungry. The eggplant dish was the best. the Tom Yum Gung was disappointing as was the beef salad.
66,"I ordered the Pad Kee Mow and veggie curry puffs. Everything was so bland! Especially the Pad Kee Mow... Usually for these stir fried noodles, the noodles soak up the sauce and makes it taste even better, but there was literally no sauce for the noodles to soak up.. No sweetness, no saltiness, nothing except spicy (which they just sprinkled on some pepper flakes). Thai tea was also watered down. Overall wouldn't order here again unless desperate for some free delivery thai food!"
67,It's cheap but pretty bad. The Pad Thai was bland. The chicken was dry and tough. Pad See Ew was drenched in sauce. The only redeeming quality is the 1 dollar thai ice teas (with a yelp check in).
68,"So, boston native - cali transplant here and I am a Thai food FANATIC! From the spicy and delicious Basil Chicken to the succulent and savory Pineapple Rice, I love it all!Unfortunately, my first thai food experience in California was pretty bad. The food took over 2 hours to get to our apartment even though it's little under 2 miles away and we didn't order that much food. Then when we finally get our 3 rice dishes we notice our drinks are missing so we phone the driver who tells us he'll be right back.My pineapple rice was just okay, there wasn't any mild spice to it (even though they ask you to select your spice level)and they gave us Tipatios........like really? no sriracha? I guess.20 minutes goes by and we call the shop and the driver is there, because he actually didn't have the drinks and had to go get them. Okay, cool - we're still really cool and they say they're on their way. another 2 hours later - we're on the phone trying to get them to acknowledge that we paid for things that they did not send us and that we either want a 1. refund or 2. for you to bring us our drinks??????we're still waiting. It's now 10:30 and we ordered at 6.hope this doesnt happen to anyone else :("
69,"I'm a Thai food snob.  Or I have a romantic idea of what Thai food is supposed to taste like.  My family used to frequent a very authentic Thai restaurant in Orange County that was owned and operated by a very authentic Thai family.  Seriously--grandma was cooking my garlic shrimp and dad was serving it.  It was ridiculously good, so I'm kinda spoiled.  Tuk Tuk is a two-star restaurant for me because I would try a different Thai place in a heartbeat, but I've been here multiple times because it's consistently not bad and the name is so catchy that it's all I can think of when somebody wants Thai food."
70,"The one star is for tuk tuk thai's dirty ass kitchen. I have been a great fan of tuk tuk Thai since I work on the next block and usually get their food to go for lunch. I am a noodle soup master (I'm pretty sure 80%of my meals are some form of a noodle soup) and am a huge fan of their wonton noodle soup. The flavor is not too heavy, not too light, and the broth is very refreshing and comforting on a cold day. I liked their wonton noodle soup so much that I would get it 3-4 times a week. However, about a few months ago, I noticed bugs in my soup when I opened the container so I called them and they said they would give me a free meal next time. Now, I'm pretty lenient on bugs when it comes to noodle soups. I have a really sharp eye for them and usually, when I see a small one, I let it go. Sometimes, small flies fly in when they cook, I understand. (More protein, as my Chinese parents would say.) However, the quantity and size of these bugs was absolutely disgusting and I completely lost my appetite. Not only could I count the legs, but I can also see the HAIR on the legs. Yup. Also! Not only were there different kinds of bugs in the soup, there were also bug EGGS! Holy shit! When I went back for my free meal, I ordered another wonton noodle soup (silly me), and you would think that they would remember to check for bugs after knowing that my meal is compensated because I found bugs last time, but no. Same shit. I found a ton of bugs. I brought my soup to the manager who had the nerve to tell me it was pepper. Honey, I cook and I know the difference between pepper and bugs. Pepper does not sprout 6 legs and a head and an abdomen. After an inspection of the kitchen, the manager told me they did find bugs (in the spinach) and comped my meal again. Nicely done.Today, after several months after that incident, I was craving some wonton noodle soup and so I went back and ordered one. Alas, there are bugs. Very small ones but bugs nonetheless. I thought I convinced myself never to come back here after that last ordeal but this did it for me. No more wonton noodle soups from tuk tuk Thai or anything else from them for that matter. You have lost a very valuable customer."
71,"Horrible experience! I normally love this place but tonight it took 30 mins to even get our appetizer (fresh rolls!!), and our entrees showed no signs of coming out.  Meanwhile we're watching the table next to us, that came after us, eating the exact same meal we ordered! After 45mins we left. Had to pay the full price for our fresh rolls even though it was part of a cheaper combo and there was no offer to comp anything. I know they were busy tonight, and I'm normally a very patient person but that experience really upset me. We were completely forgotten."
72,"Chicken skewers were dry. Pad Thai was dry and flavorless. Dessert was good, but a bit overpriced. Overall, food was below average and way overpriced. 2 appetizers, 2 orders of pad Thai, and 3 dessert orders cost $62 not including tip. Don't think I'll come back, I feel like a rape victim."
73,"The only redeeming quality is that tuk tuk thai is open late but that isnt enough to endure the misfortune of their plates. Worst thai place i ate at in Berkeley. Sadly, this place used to be very relable and seemingly is going down hill with the quailty of food and horrible take out. I am a generally forgiving person and perhsps its why i assume that each time that i foolishly patronize this sad excuse for an eatery, the produce will not be as disappointing as the times prior. This time, the tiny nubs of chicken that were served in place of a chicken satay were made to look even smaller by the lengths of wood they were squered upon. The visual effect described made his meal somehow more pitious. the container of peanut sauce accompanyng held less then a table spoon of sauce. I am truely upset that ive again given this trap my funding, i am disappointed in them and myself. Never again will i succumb to the impulse to order from here- instead ill go to chris thai or anywhere else. The cup of brown rice i asked for tipped the cost of this meal towards 22 dollars. I truly feel cheated."
74,They just missed my order and then didn't agree that they have missed the correct dish
75,"We've been going to Tuk Tuk for a couple of years now, and it's never been amazing, but it's convenient and good enough. But tonight they lost future business. Service started out as slow - I ended up getting my own silverware off another table - and went downhill from there. We ordered basil fried rice and received basil chicken with rice. The server took it away  (with a mood that definitely implied we were wrong) and we waited...and waited. We eventually asked for it to be boxed to go when it was ready. Now that we're home and opening it up, it's really clear that the basil chicken with rice was simply tossed together in the kitchen and boxed up. There were no apologies, no adjustments, and no basil fried rice."
76,"Gross, greasy and waaaay overpriced. It's hard to screw up pad Thai but somehow they managed -- both the texture and flavor were way off. And service is terrible even when the restaurant is empty; our waiter didn't stop by even once after dropping off the food.I feel like it used to be better -- but maybe it was just cheaper?"
77,"AGGHHHH I have been eating here for YEARS!Tonight was the last night....It's been going down hill, but usually it can be overlooked because I used to love this place so much. This place is a hot mess.They used to have gluten, then they stopped putting it in my veg pad thai. So I started asking about it (totally willing to pay if that's the deal....it's not)first time I asked the waitress got all in my shit like I don't deserve TOFU AND GLUTEN. Every time since then I've asked, and all but one time, the servers nodded said yes, wrote it down, and NOTHING.from the menu- HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY- HOUSE WINE $4from my bill at 5:30pm (she never brought my glass) wine $5.70 they randomly brought a serving of ""jasmine rice"" we neither ordered nor wanted, and charged us.Had to get our own water refills and poke around for condiments because or server  vanished for about 20 minutes. the service is just bad during the day (I think they bring an A crew in on weekend nights)The food is just not that good anymore. I don't know what happened. They spent all their energy on the redecorate and just forgot that if you keep screwing over your customers we won't come back :(They used to at least pretend they cared if you were satisfied or not."
78,"There are a bunch of better Thai restaurants around this area. My waiter wasn't that great and the food was even worse. Although I do like the fried mushrooms, I think that's the only good thing"
79,"We've eaten here and had take out from here many, many times. For the most part it's awesome. But sometimes it sucks.Things we've ordered:Kao Pod Tod (corn fritters, usually amazing)Vegetarian Pumpkin CurryTao Hoo Tod (deep fried tofu)Thai Sweet and SourPad Prig KhingGuey Teaw Khi MaoKoa Pad Kra ProaVegetarian Egg/Spring Rolls (I don't see these on the menu they have online, but I think we ordered them in the restaurant once, and they came with a lunch special the other time. They have a weird aftertaste)Like I said, for the most part it's awesome. But once the green beans in my Pad Prig Khing were so NOT DONE that I couldn't eat the meal. They were basically raw, just warmed. It's not like I could really eat around them because they're the main ingredient in the dish. Another time, we did an online order during lunchtime (12:30) on a Thursday. We both got the vegetarian pumpkin curry special that came with a vegetarian egg roll and rice. We also got an order of Kao Pod Tod. When we picked up our order, the Kao Pod Tod was so burnt that they weren't even in little patties anymore (I took a picture with my phone, it was so bad). They were just hard, crunchy little rocks of corn and batter that tasted like burnt oil. The veggie spring roll had such a gross weird taste to it (burnt oil again, maybe?) that we both ate a bite and had to spit it out. The pumpkin curry was good except for one weird thing....  hers had tons of peppers and veggies in it, and mine had none. Mine was literally just pumpkin and tofu in curry sauce. We haven't been back since then. I love their food when it's good, but I'm not willing to risk spending $30 on lunch if there's a possibility it will barely be edible.I guess don't go during lunch or any other busy times?"
80,"I've been here a couple of times now to unbiasedly Yelp about it. Overall, it's a decent place that hits-the-spot and satisfies my Thai food cravings. It's clean, efficient, and there are A LOT of people that work there (like half of them!) I love that you can get the fish sauce, chili, and whatever other condiments you want to go.- Pad Thai: very standard; similar to what you would find elsewhere! - Panang curry: it was very sweet and delicious! There's carrots, broccoli, green beans, baby corn, and zucchinis in there too. Really yummy!- Larb: it was decent but a little too sweet. I easily remedied this by adding some fish sauce to make it more savory. Rice is an additional $1.50, and i found a shrimp shell in my Larb (but I'll assume it was just a mistake). However, bottom line is that I won't mind coming back here for takeout, especially since it's so close to where I live!"
81,Its a nice place with a nice environment and friendly staff. The food hasn't wow'd me because the noodles I ordered were overcooked (twice in consecutive visits). I'm not sure if the flavor is supposed to be like that or its the cook's error. I suppose I should try something else on the menu but currently I don't have much incentive to go again.
82,"Was not as good as I expected. Had the wonton soup, was just ok. The pad thai was boring. I liked the crab and cheese rangoons though. but overall, just ok."
83,"Bad curry. Very bad. Do not order the peanut curry (beef) with vegetables. It's watery, overly and shockingly sweet (mango syrup? coconut + lots of sugar? I have no idea..). And the vegetables included are practically raw. The shreds of sliced meat were bland. Also expect a small bowl of curry. At $7.55 I was very disappointed. RICE COSTS AN EXTRA $1.50. Um yeah. Thanks for the heads up waitress.. Thanks. I dislike this place though I will come back here should friends want to. I tried my friend's duck noodle soup which was very tasty and delicious. But, I'm judging this place based on what I paid for holding everything else constant (econ, what?).This disjointed review symbolizes my dislike for this place!"
84,"More like yuck, yuck. We had mediocre veggie tom kha and mediocre veggie green curry. Nothing special at all. They didn't pack any rice in our to-go, though we ordered and paid for it.So-so papaya salad, and WORST, most offensive spring rolls EVER. They didn't even have cilantro or mint in them. They were oily (and I'm talking about the fresh kind!) and full of cabbage and tasted honestly like they were made my Chinese people, not Thai. Never had such bad spring rolls, even at the very awful Emeryville Public Market.Place was also EMPTY ~8:30 p.m. Perhaps others agree and are staying away too."
85,"I won't start with the cliche: ""I would give zero star if I could."" I will let the story speaks for itself. I SWEAR ON MY OWN HEAD THAT IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE. Warning: it's painfully funny. 7:46pm, June 25, 2014. Arrived at Tuk Tuk Thai. Thought that I couldn't make it to Berkeley Bowl in time so I decided to eat in the restaurant. Big mistake. The restaurant was not crowded at the time, so I sat in a 4 chairs table next to the window. I knew what I wanted, so I waved at the greeter, assuming she was my server. She said she would call my server instead. She walked in the back, a few people looked out my way, and about two minutes, a stone-cold face woman (white, long hair, pony tail, mean look) walked out. I guess they were arguing who should serve me.I got a feeling in my stomach that I should go, but boy, I stayed. Anyway, that stone-cold woman, let's call her B, walked to me: ""What do you want?""Me: Coconut milk soup noodle. B: What kind of meat?Me: Is there any choice of meat? [I didn't see any]B: Veggie?Me: What meat do you have?B: [Listing]Me: Mushroom is fineB: OkMe: I just need a glass of water. Thanks. B: [didn't say ""welcome"", with that botox frozen face, she walked away. Another woman, Asian with glass, brought me my dish. What's wrong with these people? They don't know how to say ""welcome"" after hearing ""thank you""?I didn't even finish half of my bowl (seriously, only a few slurp; I was thinking on a math problem). Then B came out and handed me the receipt slip: ""Take your time.""I stared at her amused; I was nowhere near half way down. She sensed it and asked: ""Are you not ready?""Me: Yes [smiled, hoping she would take it back]B: That's what I said, ""take your time""Me: Well but I haven't finishedB: Do you want me to take it back?Me: YesB: Why? [WHY? Because you're my server? And because it is not a strange request? At all?]B: I'm trying to help you out.Me: Can you just please take it back! [I put my foot down and got a bit annoyed]B: [Silently took it away and gave me THE LOOK, for a good two minutes when she walked her butt back]Well the meal was RUINED [It was not really good to begin with]. B while walking past me always managed to give me THE LOOK. [Namo amituofo, ""see b*tch in everyone??""]I finished 3/4 my meal, took the receipt, threw the credit card, walked to her and asked: ""Who's the manager?""B: I'm the managerMe: Who's the ownerB: He's not here; I don't know whyMe: I don't careI walked to a different server (Asian with glasses): ""Who's the manager?"" and pointed at B: ""Is she the manager?"" The server: ""Uh no""Me: ""So who's the manager, get me the manager""She walked in the back and out with a tall blond man. He asked if I was ok. B quickly walked toward me and babble immediately: ""Usually when people dine alone, they eat quickly.""[First: you don't know me; second: that's not the only issue: your attitude is the issue]Me: You lied to me; you're not the manager.B: [Pointed to the guy] This guy is the manager? You're kidding me? We're both managers.[Ok, so which one is true? Your statement is self-contradictory]Me: You had your talk, let me talk to him B: Don't place your hand over my face [Oh boy, I didn't even do the wave thing, I gave the ""stop"" sign]Me: Well I didn't touch you [B walked away]Me: [Explained my frustration] I've been with this place for two years [actually three] but I won't come back again; that's ok, you'll have other customers to abuse. I'll sign here and no tip. B: [came back for some more] Do you want me to quit? Is that what you want? [with tears in her eyes]Me: [sarcastically] Yes that would be nice. [On hindsight, a better come back would be: ""Is that what I want or that's what you want?""]Me: I understand your stress, but don't take it out on me. If you don't want to serve, don't serve. B even had the nerve to yank the receipt while I was signing it. She said: ""You don't have to sign"".B: Here's your copy [threw at me quickly]Me: Don't charge more than that; my credit card comp will talk with you.Another server: [to me] I think you should go [I will, but give me some time to pack up my butt, hon]But I stand my ground, as I said one last time: ""If you don't want the job, don't do the job.""Oh boy, I pity the poor soul. With a quick mouth that pours nonsense like that, she has yet to get her anywhere else better. I guess some people are just as petty as their lives are.Meanwhile, I still have my Three twin ice creams and penny dreadful at home. Let's call it a day.Boy, should have just walked to Cafe Colucci. They are farther, more expensive, but they serve people better. [Just find out: the server name is Lorin, stay away from her; she has issues.][Also found out from Yelp that they are among unethical restaurants whose servers add their own tips - that's why Lorin didn't want me to sign? My credit card comp will keep an eye on this.]"
86,"I came here with a friend just a little before midnight, totally excited to have stumbled upon a new late night Thai place and was utterly disappointed. We ordered a pad see ew that was bland and weak in comparison to Chris's up the street (which I love) and a rubbery cold duck with chunks of gelatin stuck to it. This place had weak flavors, confusing ambiance and lacked authenticity and quality. We were the only ones there but  decided to eat in, we brought the majority our food home but ended up throwing it all out since it wasn't good to begin with. Bummer."
87,"UPDATE: 5/2011Went in because I haven't been there for a while. Service was slow and I got my appetizer after my entrée?! Food was eh-eh. Was disappointed and not going to rave about this place again.Oh and they wouldn't give me the password to their wifi. They used to. What happened?ORIGINAL POST: 3/2011I used to LOVE this place. Their fried sweet potatoes and pinapple fried rice was SO good. Until... they kept messing up my orders. I'm a vegetarian and I get sick with even a silver of meat in my dishes. I found a chunk of chicken in the to-go container with the fried sweet potatoes. It looked like one of those patties so I bit in it and ran to throw up once I realized what it was. Not cool. And they KEEP putting beef or chicken in my fried rice and I got sick of having to go back and fix the order. So, I am not going there any more unless it's eat-in.Nevertheless, their food is delish and cheap! My meat-eating friends said they don't put enough meat in their dishes. Heads up! Ask for more."
88,Wow that was terrible! This place was a complete disaster. I don't know if I should fill you in on the horrid details. It's like a horror story. A miserable sad and terrible kind of restaurant. Should I go on? That's enough.
89,"Don't come here.  We waited so long for our dinner.   The restaurant was not busy and there seemed to be enough cooks and waiters to run the restaurant.  The food was not worth the wait.  By the end of the dinner, i just wanted to leave because i was tired of waiting for our food.  As we were ready to pay our check, i asked the waitress if she can adjust the bill to reflect the ""yelp $1 thai ice tea"".  The waitress said she would have to look for the mgr and it would take 5minute to adjust the bill.  I'm already tired of waiting for my food and you want me to wait more so i can get the discounted price for the ice tea??!!!  I said no thanks and i felt she was glad i didn't pursue it.  I won't come here again.  I have gone here off and on for the past 10 years.  In these recent years, the food has gotten worst and the decor got better.  I'll pass on the decor."
90,"The only reason I will ever go to Tuk Tuk Thai again is if I completely run out of food at my house and every other Thai place around is either closed or has been destroyed in a fire or some other disaster because their food SUCKS. Not only that, but they advertise having a certain percent off of appetizers during happy hour on their website but don't honor that advertisement in the actual restaurant! I walked a mile to Tuk Tuk from my house to pick up some happy hour appetizers and when I got there they told me they don't offer that anymore. Total bull if you ask me!Whatever you do, save yourself the disappointment and go eat at one of the hundred other (and BETTER) Thai places in Berkeley!"
91,"Let's just say that I'm glad I had a townhog deal here. I paid $10 for $20.The food was not good. We ordered the pad se lew, po tak soup, and panang curry. The soup wasn't even hot when it came out. Every single dish was so sweet. Big turn off. I don't know if this is how Thai dishes are supposed to taste, but I'm definitely not coming back.I have to say that the place is pretty clean though, which always wins stars in my book. Their mango sticky rice was delicious, but maybe that's because that dish is actually supposed to be sweet.Overall: There's better places to get food. Save your money and go elsewhere."
92,"Just ate here with my coworkers today, the service was really good over there but the food wasn't that great. My Pad Kee Mao had thick hard beef and tough to chew. My veggies were too big for me to eat with the noodles. Place has been around for 10 years, then they recently changed chefs so the food doesn't taste as good as it used to be."
93,"I ordered their pumpkin curry today and was sorely disappointed. The cabbage in my complimentary soup was still stiff and raw while the pumpkins were also undercooked and not shaved clean. The curry was saturated by a large dosage of coconut milk while the hint of basil was too pale to have an impact. For $8, my rice and egg roll were the only highlights. The service was awkward as I was asked whether I was going to pay by cash or credit card during the time my order was taken. Later on, the server picked up my bill but went on a detour to sit and chat with his colleagues before coming to my table. These are unforgivable mistakes since it all happened prior to the arrival of the lunch crowd. Finally, to all restaurant owners if you're reading: It is a turnoff to display the already calculated gratuity that your customers should pay on the bill. Is it so necessary for you to school us on how much more we should pay for your lame service? Not cool."
94,"I have ordered from here online several times. Most of the time, I'm pretty satisfied. The food is usually good, not excellent, and delivered 15-30mins after the time slot I request (the earliest you can get is about an hour after you order).Today was a different story. I wanted to have my food delivered (and still hot) when my friend came over at 8. It was delivered over an hour early, and already cold! Why give people that option if you are just going to deliver things as soon as they are ready? I would have just ordered my food later.I'm also pretty miffed when it comes to the food itself. The Kao Pad Kra Proa does not fill up a whole container- it is half rice. I ordered it with the option of tofu and wheat gluten (all you veggies who haven't heard of wheat gluten, you're welcome); there is no wheat gluten in the dish. I ordered a side of steamed veggies for $3.50, which is a little steep for a side dish, but I had the option to choose the three veggies I wanted. I picked broccoli, bell peppers, and carrots, but got a dish with no bell peppers at all- it's just random veggies.Also, I although it won't show up on my statement until tomorrow, the delivery slip says ""+CARROT $1.00"". I don't know if this is just an error, but I'll be pretty mad if I was charged extra after approving my total without being asked."
95,"With the vast selection of Thai restaurants in Berkeley, this was a one and done for me.  Tried 3 different dishes...Duck noodle soup, yellow curry chicken, and Pad see ew, and not only are they better elsewhere, but seems to be a little bit cheaper at other Thai establishments in and around the area as well.  Now i know...."
96,"This review is about my waiter, not the food.  I ordered a papaya salad.  I didn't ask for shrimp, just the salad.  If you get the shrimp, it's an extra dollar.   When the dish came, it had shrimp in it and so I asked the waiter if the shrimp was an extra add on and he said that papaya salad comes with shrimp and if you don't want shrimp, you have to say no shrimp.   What kind of BS is this!?   My bill came and sure enough it was an extra dollar.  This waiter is so shady and btw, the shrimp was overlooked and very dry.   I ordered this before and none of the other waiters ever added shrimp unless I asked for it.   I went on a Monday night and the waiter was an Asian guy.  What the heck was he trying to achieve? A bigger tip?  Think I wouldn't notice?  Slow day?  Other waiters were very professional and not as shady as the one I had tonight."
97,"Too expensive for what you get. We have gotten a number of dishes here ""to go"", and they are pretty standard for what you get around here for Thai food. Last dish we got was a soup, Tom Kha Gai, which I wanted because I had a cold. It's supposed to be chicken soup in a creamy coconut base with galangal. I have had fantastic versions of this elsewhere, but was totally surprised to find they put seafood in here, and it cost over $12 !!! Maybe they gave us the wrong soup? Not sure, but I am kind of over this place."
98,"This place has been one of my favorite Thai places, but that all changed today. My sister insisted we not eat here, but I told her lets just give it another try bc maybe they went on a bad day. Ha!!!!!!!The service is HORRIBLE because you always have to flag down a waiter to get their attention, and when you do they act like you're bothering them. I felt like I was at a self serve restaurant where they just serve you the food, and you get everything yourself. Their yellow curry tasted watered down and had no flavor. The pad thai was undercooked and tasted more chewy than tender. The food tastes more bland now like you have to add more spices to it.During the entire meal, NONE of the staff asked us if we needed anything or if everything was okay. Then, when we get the bill the waiter dumps the bill tray on the edge of the table. Rude. They really don't give a sh*t about customer service, and looks like the same with their quality of food they are serving now. Sad. I was really disappointed and will not be coming back for a loooong time, unless I am desperate for Thai food and nothing else is open.They really need to work on their customer service bc that is probably the WORST service I have ever experienced."
99,"Ok, it's official... F*$% this place. My friend got food poisoning here!1) The food is AWFUL!2) The service is SLOW and INEFFICIENT!:* Never refilled my water* Food took forever and it wasn't busy* When the receipt came for me to sign, the pen didn't work. I notified                                                                               my nonchalant server and he DROPS, not places, but drops 3 other pens on the table. Word of advice you rude a$$#*l^, try out the pen yourself and then bring it to me dude3) Aside from the big Tuk-Tuk at the entrance, the place has no decor and looks like a cafeteria.Do yourself a huge favor and DON'T go here. Thai Noodle on the other side of University Ave. on Shattuck is AMAZING. It's a hole in the wall but the food is AWESOMELY authentically delicious and the servers are super kind and sweet. (I recommend the fried chicken over rice there)"
100,"They double charged us, perhaps accidentally, but they didn't make it right.We used the online ordering system and goofed. One of us paid online, the other paid when picking up. We didn't realize and let Tuk Tuk know until several weeks later. The staff person was rudely skeptical, despite examining our credit card statements and receipt. She said she needed to check with her manager, who would call me back.I left my business card and personal phone number. Did I receive a call back? Not with a one star review, I didn't.Oh, for completeness:(+) Positives: convenient location, open late.(//) So-so: food quality; value for amount is fine.(-) Other negatives: I guess it's a sign that the restaurant is named after the ""tuk tuk,"" an overpriced mode of transportation in Bangkok aimed at tourists, with many driven by con men seeking to take you to various jewelry and shopping scams.There are plenty of superior Thai restaurants around downtown Berkeley."
101,"I remember this place  from a few years ago and the food was fresh, the Tom yum goong always had fresh mushroom and cilantro... I came back and I'm disappointed how bad the food quality is. I wonder if they have a new cook or owner, but it's not the same... overcooked shrimp and saggy looking mushrooms in the soup is just wrong."
102,"No. Don't do it. So much regret. I had high hopes because the interior was so cool looking. The best part of dinner was literally the thai coffee and thai iced tea...sadness.  We got the tom yum soup...which didn't taste much like tom yum and the portions for the ""large"" was kind of insulting. My main complaints are about the ridiculously small portions and flavor. I admit that the duck plates were good but the portion size was just not worth the price I paid for them. In addition, the pineapple fried rice (by far) is the worst I have every eaten. The pineapple itself had a very funky flavor. I don't know if the chunks went bad before they were cooked but it was just not a pleasant experience. I would much rather go to Thai Basil, where the flavors are spot on at a fraction of the price that I paid for dishes here at  Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe."
103,"My neighbor mentioned the other night that she was going to Tuk Tuk Thai for dinner, so when I was home sick and wanted some spicy Thai to make me feel better, I thought I'd see how it was.  It wasn't very good.One star for cool online ordering system with full menu and add-on options.  The online ordering module allows you to save orders so you can see them in the future, calculates your tips for you, and even allows you to identify who parts of the order are for (Mike wants pad thai, Beth wants the iced tea, etc.)One star for timely delivery.I ordered Coconut Milk Soup w/ Chicken, and asked for it to be SPICY.  The ingredients were cooked just right, but the soup was flavorless.  You could barely taste any lemongrass, and the spice was clearly overlooked.I ordered Pad Thai w/ Mixed Seafood + extra broccoli + medium spicy.   It was piping hot, and there was plenty of it.  However, I found 1 broccoli floret (cooked almost beyond recognition), and the flavors were totally lacking except for the spice.  Like I said before, I asked for the spice, but I know the difference between spice and flavor.  Once I got used to the super spiciness of the dish, it became clear that no other flavors were present.  The generous portion had the negative effect of causing the noodles to become so globbed together that it was difficult to eat.  There was almost no fish in the dish either, so it was basically a big goopy brick of noodles.I ordered Pr Ram w/ Chicken + extra carrots.  This dish just made me mad.  Not only was the broccoli I asked for in my Pad Thai added to this dish instead, but they obviously pulled the chicken out of a pot of boiling water, dropped a handful of broccoli and a handful of julienned carrots on top, and then ladled a couple cups of peanut sauce on the top of everything.  The chicken was flavorless and wasn't mixed into the sauce at all.  The carrots and broccoli were the same.  The peanut sauce wasn't even that flavorful.  Not sweet, not spicy, not even very nutty.I didn't bother opening the box of jasmine rice.With the number of great Thai places around, the only thing this place has going for it is the delivery, and the food was so disappointing that even at my laziest moment I would never order from this place again.  So disappointing."
104,"The food was not bad, also not the best thai food I've ever had either though.  The thai ice tea was good.  The pineapple fried rice was ok, it was a little more bland than I had expected.  The crab wontons (appetizers) were also pretty good.  The pad see ew and tom yum gai (soup) the best I think, though I wish the soup had more broth.  Overall, not bad (perhaps just based on the food, I'd give 3 stars), but the factor which makes the restaurant less appealing (2 stars) is the service. At first I thought our waitress was nice, but then she had a terrible attitude problem.  We had to work to get her attention (or anyone's) multiple times.  She never came and checked on us.  At some point, I saw her with her purse on her shoulder, which I'm assuming means she was finishing her shift, so perhaps that's why she was so cranky.  Regardless, that's not an excuse.  The waitress who at the end of the meal came by to collect our plates and give us to go boxes, was much nicer.  3 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service."
105,I just ate there tonight and im going to say this is a American thai food . Please stay away from here food sucks no flavor and not worth the price lack of flavor and not real thai food . I had better thai food but not here . Fyi you will not like the food .
106,"How hard can it be to make a freaking plate of pad thai? Somehow these guys screwed it up.The sauce was not even tossed properly with the noodles (leaving bare spots and gloopy spots), and the portion was tiny. Plus it had that unmistakable burned odor coming from God-knows-what. I had gotten this to go, so it was impossible to get it fixed. Oh and it was almost 8 bucks!The only reason I'm generously offering them a second star is that they have a tuk-tuk parked in the middle of the dining room, and my little kid likes to pretend he's a wealthy Bangkok tourist and I'm an overworked tuk-tuk driver. Hey, he just tipped me a dollar!"
107,"I have eaten here before, and have enjoyed the food in the past, but my most recent dining experience was subpar to say the least. I ordered a dish with green beans and tofu in a spicy chili paste. The chili sauce & tofu tasted ok, but the green beans were completely raw. I asked the waitress to please recook the green beans a little longer, but they came back raw again. The waitress was kind enough to ask to recook the dish again, but instead, I asked for an extra order of rice only to sadly discover a mouthful of dried out crunchy pieces of rice. This was an extremely disappointing dining experience. Sorry to say, I will not be dining at Tuk, Tuk anytime soon..."
108,"Just spent 10 minutes on hold waiting for then to tell me they'd credit the mistake on my to go order... Only to taste the pumpkin curry... With completely uncooked ""pumpkin."" I feel sick that I even have this place another try and another $30. Never again. Have already written about how they went down in quality since the management changed... But wow, now the food is terrible, too. Too bad!"
109,"The boy and I went here Saturday night...when we thought we were just going to eat left overs and or go on a ""diet"" for the evening. Though my tummy was grumbling so I remembered my bro recommended two Thai restaurants in Berkeley that's open late. Thus, I yelped.We were supposed to go to Thai Noodle but since it was late, hunger and fear of not finding parking, we opted to go here.It was semi-packed (the boy did mention that it was filled with non-asian folks ~ got nervous there but we still stayed...) I ordered the pad see ew like but with gravy (I'm blanking out right with the name of it) and the boy got the red curry. We opted to get ""brown rice"" as well to be healthy.Food came really quick and I was shocked that the gravy of the noodles (which I usually order) was like a soup! It was in a pho like bowl with gravy. WHOA! Lots of gravy and barely no meat. The boy agreed. We ate what we could...Nonetheless...we'll try Thai Noodle next time we decide to get dinner at 10 pmish. PS: service was ok for us...typical asian restaurant where you have to raise your hand to be served. No rudeness ... but I guess I don't really want to find out next time...so yes, there won't be a next time unless real hunger comes over...desperation mode."
110,"This place came highly recommended for beef noodle soup with rice noodle but since my husband and I do not eat beef, we decided to try something else.  He ordered the yellow curry with tofu and steamed white rice and I ordered the seafood noodle soup with egg noodle.  We do not recommend either.  My husband said the rice was a little stale and the curry was just okay.  I did not care at all for the soup.  The egg noodles were stiff and difficult to separate and eat.  The broth was bland and the only item enjoyable in the bowl was the tofu.We would probably come back to try a different item but not any time soon."
111,"My last visit was back in March or April, and it appears the restaurant had just come under new management at the time, as the menu and food have changed dramatically.  It feels like they are trying to cut corners, which resulted in much poorer food quality (tough tofu in vegetarian dishes, flavorless watery sauces) as well as smaller portions.  The service is ok, although the wait staff weren't fully up to speed on all the new menu items at the time.I love Thai food and came here regularly before, but my last experience left so much to be desired that I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.  There are many other better places to get your Thai food fix."
112,"I've eaten here before and the food has been pretty good. However my most recent experience was pretty bad. I ordered some chicken dish with vegetables. It arrived and looked delicious, and tasted good. It had nice quality chunks of chicken and well cooked vegetables. However, it also contained HAIR! I pulled out a small piece of hair, but the food was so good I wanted to keep eating. I then pulled out 3 more pieces of hair. this was unacceptable. I informed the crew right away and they made me a new order of the same thing. Well, the new item arrived and was not nearly as high quality as the first. It had shredded chicken, roughly chopped vegetables, and was luke-warm in a soupy sauce. It was barely edible: I ate a little bit and then left the rest. The only reason they get 2 stars is because they didn't charge me for the dish, which was the right thing to do.Upon review, I could see the chef had a hat on, with a large chunk of hair just dangling in front of her face. Absolutely disgusting and not ok, and definitely not LEGAL! I won't be back as this has ruined this place for me. Can't trust a place with hair in the food and chefs without proper hair nets."
113,"The restaurantf felt more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. It took quite a while for the server to come ask for our order, or even for drinks. The food was pretty tasty, but not the best Pad Thai that I've had. If I had the choice of going there again I would probably say- no, let's go try a different place. There was nothing really fantastic about the place or the service. When we were ready to leave and pay, my friend and I were splitting the bill- we both got the same thing, and a beer each- so it was literally down the middle. The server brought back the credit card slips and he had swiped my friends card twice. Not mine. We sent it back and the server seemed super confused. This wasn't a language barrier here- it's math and seeing that they clearly didn't swipe my card at all. He took the bills, came back with the voided transactions, and TWO MORE SLIPS WITH ONLY MY FRIENDS CARD!!! Haha, are you serious? WOW. So I waved him over again- said, Noooo, don't you see that you didn't even swipe my card? So he just took one of the bills away. OMG. I have a feeling my friend has 4 charges on his card because of a simple transaction gone wrong. Talk about human error! So yeah. I don't think I'll ever go here again. Sorry kids."
114,"Busy night for take outs? Poor excuse for bad service, especially when most tables were empty. I got up multiple times to get things for myself. =/Papaya Salad - decentVegetable Curry - GoodPad See Lew - Disappointed, worst I've had anywhere. Left it untouchedFresh Coconut - Yum! Service - Bleh to put it nicely. Maybe it was an off Wednesday night. Maybe I was too hungry for my own good. Maybe this is just one of those places you go to 'cause it's cheap, convenient, down the street - not 'cause it's to rave about."
115,"The prices are good here, but the food really was not. I've had enough Thai food to know when it's good or not good. This was on the not-good end of the spectrum. I ordered the chicken kabob and, though the salad and dressing were decent, the chicken was baked dry and chewy. Also, it arrived cold.I had an opportunity to sample the green papaya salad, too. It was alright, but not something to write home about.Lastly, the service was not great. After serving the food, the waitress didn't return, except to drop off the check and ask if there was any interest in desert."
116,"I've been here more than a few times, more because of the convenience (it's very close to my work) than the service. I love that it's open until 1am, as most places in Berkeley close their doors at 10pm or 11pm. I think that the only thing they really have going.I've had their Pad Thai, Rad Na, duck fried rice, and pad see ew. Pretty standard fares. I've only sat down to eat once. Most of the time, my food came with a sigh of disappointment. They use some veggies not really native to the dish, so the flavors are strange. The rad na was VERY soupy (it's pad fried flat noodles with meat/veggie/gravy poured on top), my poor noodles were hard to find the sea of murky gravy. The duck fried rice was bland and had very few pieces of duck. The pad see ew was somehow incredibly bitter (too much bok choy?), and the pad thai was not even memorable. What makes it even worse is the service, the folks that work there just really don't care if you're not in a large party. A majority of their time is spent talking to each other or eating. The one time I've called in for pick up, I had placed my order and went in 15 minutes later to pick it up. I was made to wait an additional 25 minutes for my meal. After that, I just couldn't come back again. No courtesy at all. It seems that I said 'thank you' more than they did. Pity."
117,"Disgusting! My son ordered a vegetarian spring roll and there was a shrimp tail in it! Not a shrimp, mind you, but the tail. Like one that had been discarded from someone's plate after being eaten. Good thing he isn't allergic to shrimp. They acted like we were weird for complaining about it when we were really nice and could have made a much bigger deal out of it. I could see into their kitchen and realized it wasn't very sanitary looking. Yuck!!! Permanent heebie-geebies for Tuk Tuk now. I got chicken with peanut sauce and my chicken was a bland frozen breast that had seemingly been boiled. No flavor whatsoever. The peanut sauce was peanut butter and water stirred together, I think. I was shocked they got away with this in Berkeley. This was to be my last visit ever. I had some not so stellar previous experiences but was willing to give them another chance. And another. But nothing ever stood out. And after getting that shrimp tail, I will never eat here again. There are way too many other options in Berkeley to put your life at risk. Which is what you're doing if you have any kind of food allergy at all, especially to shellfish. I'm surprised the health department hasn't been called in yet."
118,"GONE DOWNHILL. I used to go to this place regularly as it is open late and I liked the food. Unfortunately, they have a new rice policy. It's two dollars for one scoop of rice. But what is one scoop? Well, let's just say it was the least amount of rice I have had in my life. I like a high ratio of curry to rice, but this was ridiculous. I would say it was less than half of the amount one would expect to get for an average portion.My wife had to pick up takeout just now, and was in the area, so we decided to give it another try. I had complained last time, so I figured they could have changed their policy, or maybe it would be better for takeout. I asked my wife to address the rice issue. Nothing doing. They insisted, two dollars per one scoop of rice. Please. I am making my own rice at home right now. And we are never going to waste time with them again.(And now I will mention that once back in the day I got something foreign in my food."
119,"Let me preface this review by saying that Tuk Tuk Thai is usually a sure bet for a tasty weeknight meal.  Usually our food is good and the service is prompt.  My husband and I like the curries and Pad Thai, and I like the Guey Teaw Lord.  However, tonight was another experice entirely, and I hope that the manager of Tuk Tuk Thai reads this and takes it to heart:We arrived late evening on a Tuesday night.  We got our menus promptly, but it took much longer than usual for wait staff to come over and take our order.  In fact, we noticed that there were two wait staff standing by the counter chatting as if there were no customers!  The room was FULL, we could see that other people were waiting, and we were getting impatient.About the time that someone finally did come over and take our order, it was so loud in the restaurant that we had to yell out our order to the waiter.  All the noise seemed to be coming from a very large and very boistrous group of guests seated at the back of the place.  Things went downhill from there.Not only was this large party so loud that we couldn't have a normal conversation, but we noticed that it was taking a really long time to get our food.  The waiters seemed to be pre-occupied with serving the large group, leaving the many other tables unserved and unattended for most of the evening.  Again, I noticed the same two wait staff chatting at the counter instead of helping customers.When our food arrived, the spring rolls were noticeably worse than usual and our meals had cooled off considerably and did not seem at all fresh.  The taste was okay, but being fairly regular patrons we could easily say this was the worst food we had ever eaten there, and certainly the worst service.Tuk Tuk, we're taking a break from eating at your restaurant for awhile.  The combination of bad service and marginal food and an unpleasant dining environment left a bad taste in our mouth - I'm so sorry."
120,"This place is close to my house, so it's gotten my business over the years.  I have to say, it disappoints. The chicken in the soup is tough and gross, the only decent dish I've had is the eggplant pork deal."
121,"So far eating here has been a gamble, each and every time it has been a hit or miss,and rarely ever in between (in regards to food and service) Last night I went there and there was a live winged critter in the side of lettuce that came with my appetizer, and my sister stopped me from chomping it down a split second beforehand. I saw a few of these same bugs crawling around the table and in the bathroom, Tuk Tuk could be in the middle of some kind of infestation right now. And I left the place with a huge swollen itchy stinging bug bite on my arm. I got the hell outta there ASAP. Has anyone else experienced this lately?Other than this mishap the food was great, panang curry was excellent."
122,"I ordered yellow curry, medium spicy. It wasn't spicy at all. The chicken was dry, even though it was soaked in curry and the order doesn't come with a side of rice(!). A side of rice costs $2 more. I have definitely had better for around this price. However, it is nearby and open late, making it score high for my personal convenience. I ordered for pickup, but the interior looked pretty nice and spacious."
123,"This review is for the mango and sticky rice dessert only.The sticky rice was hard to chew, it tasted like it's been sitting out all day.   The mango was over-ripe and didn't taste fresh.  Yikes, I hope they do something because they're ruining the reputation of this famous dessert!"
124,"This place is a real hit or miss. Luckily it delivers. Unfortunatly the food that we have delivered tends to be much larger portions then we get when we eat there.The descriptions of the food could be better, I have been surprised a few to many times for my comfort.Portion wise, again...in house just to small...have never once left full. That is with apetizer, entree, rice, and thai ice tea. That is an awful lot of food to not fill up on."
125,"Their pad thai is a little too sweet for me. I've had it twice and on both occasions, it was too sweet. I went with two friends and we also ordered a seafood dish lunch special. It sounded so good on the menu but when we ate it, it was just okay. We also ordered a stir fry noodle dish, it was so frustrating because the noodles were bunched into ONE. This made it difficult to separate the noodles onto a different plate. Well here's one good thing, Open Late!"
126,Have heard alot of great things regarding this place from the babe. After an appointment stopped there for the first time. Walked in asked the waiter if he had change so we can put on the meter. Did not want a ticket in Berkeley. He says no change. It was only a $10 dollar bill. Had to go next door to the laundry mat and was successful.  Lady said if your eating there they should provide you with parking Lol. Wasn't happy with that waiter after all the hassle. Babe noticed prices were raised. Chicken noodle was ok just felt like more spinach than noodles. Duck over rice was good. After all not the greatest and not as filling.
127,"A one and a half...but I will be kind as it was not awful tasting just bland.  Tried them twice (always try to be fair!).  Over priced and bland, bland bland.  The most recent trip involved pumpkin curry and a most miserable fall out from the meal later in the evening....might have been better had they not left on so much of the green portion of the pumpkin?!Shame as the  colorful Tuk Tuk in the entry to the multi-colored walls with photos of Thailand...pull you in....There is just is not enough care and concern on their part to keep you coming back.  Nothing is flavorful, the Tom Kha Gai was a sad rendition and the Pad Thai was just OK.  Overall, both times were disappointing and the second visit a down right shame.  The service was okay but not great, the servers seemed to be running around like chickens but never are focused on you i(check everyone once in a while--does the customer need anything or have questions.?).Can't imagine giving them a third try....sad, as they are open late."
128,"The food was just alright and the service was horrible. The main dishes didn't come together and the noodles came out really late. We had to ask a couple of times where our noodles were. Furthermore, the check-in offer did not work since we did not mention it when we first ordered the thai iced tea. There was nothing in the check-in offer stating that. The deep fried calamari was good. Crunchy and went well with the tangy sauce. The chicken satay was just okay. The chicken was a bit dry and the peanut sauce and cucumber salad didn't really go with it. The basil sauce eggplant was the best dish we ordered. The dish wasn't that salty and the vegetables and chicken complemented each other rather well. The stir fried suki yaki was probably the worst dish I've ever had. It was too heavy and salty. It came out so late and it was the first time I've had to ever CUT my noodles with a knife to eat them!  It was a tangled mess."
129,"Tuk Tuk Thai is like an ex.It's not until you look back on it that you start the ""WTF-Process""Compared to all the other options in Berkeley I kept comin' to you.Ok, I guess you were always there. 3 blocks isn't that far to walk. You stayed up late at night and I could always count on you to be eagerly ready and waiting.But seriously. Dude. Charles. What were you thinking buddy?"
130,I ordered the beef mint salad and a coconut milk soup.  The soup was bland and the the salad had an interesting flavor not good but not bad just unusual.   The beef was a bit tough and let's put it this way.  I had left overs and i dident want to take them home which is odd for me.  Not interested in going back.
131,"We ordered delivery through Seamless, and got an estimated delivery time of 60-75 minutes. After about 90, I called to check in. They said they had our order and it was about to go out. At about 2.5 hours from the initial order, I called again. I was ""put on hold"" with no warning for a while, after which I got not an apology, but a detailed explanation of the mishaps that caused our order never to be delivered, which appeared to contradict what I had been told in the earlier phone call. Great story, but then, I didn't order a story, did I?"
132,"I ordered one of their ""specials"": a basil fish stir fry.The sauce and veg were OK, but the fish was deep fried and only luke warm and tasted like cold burger king chicken fingers - turns out they fry all of their fish for the day in the morning.  When complaining to the waiter he told me that he ""enjoyed it plenty"" and didn't offer to exchange it or give me a partial refund.  Will not be returning to the short Tuk."
133,"My husband and I ordered Panang Beef and Green Curry Chicken, and although it tasted nice, it was so incredibly spicy that we couldn't finish our meals. We both asked for mild, so it was unexpected and unwanted. We have had these dishes at other Thai restaurants and have not experienced this problem."
134,"Came here with a big group of friends. Was trying to eat healthy so I ordered just a Papaya Salad and asked for ""Thai Spicey.""  I liked how they have a taxi bike as decor, but I was really disappointed when my papaya salad was not spicy at all.....like 0 out of 10 in spice level =(.When I asked for ""Cha-yen"" they weren't sure what I was asking for either....Definitely my least favorite out of 5 thai places I have tried in Berkeley."
135,"This place used to be a lot better. I don't know what happened. The Thai iced tea was WAY too sweet. The fresh shrimp rolls were full of soggy cabbage (which neither I nor my dining partner had ever seen before), the papaya salad had limp horrible shrimp on top and just did not taste right. It didn't even taste like it had limes in it. The Pad Thai was also an overly sweet, poorly cooked glob of noodles.Then, I asked the waitress for some lime wedges (which usually come with dishes). She brought over some lemon wedges, and only offered an explanation after I gave her a look of confusion. Sorry, she said, we only have lemon- but lemon, same as lime. Hm. I can tell the difference between lime and lemon just as I can tell the difference between good Thai food and bad Thai food."
136,"Thai food is pretty difficult to mess up, but these guys have somehow succeeded. I ordered Red curry beef. The beef was very chewy and had that peculiar old roast beef flavor, much like one of those triangular sandwiches from 7-eleven that sit in the refrigerator for weeks on end and should only be eaten under dire circumstances. Some of the vegetables were overcooked, some of them undercooked. My girlfriend agrees, the food is nasty and we are never going back. In addition, the service was indifferent and the atmosphere was similar to a cafeteria. With so many other options for thai food in berkeley, why bother?"
137,"This place is Terrible with a capital T.  I ordered a Thai Iced Coffee and Spring Rolls.  The Spring Rolls were very oily and greasy.  I tasted the cooking oil more than the vegetables inside.  To top it off, the iced coffee was salty.  ""Salty?"" you might ask.  Maybe they mixed up the salt and sugar or even used soy sauce instead of coffee.  Who knows?  Seriously...if you can't even make iced coffee right you should not be in business!"
138,"They have a $20 minimum for delivery. So, they told us we had to order more, but FAILed to suggest rice. The guy on the phone kept asking us if we wanted to call back when we were ready even though we were quickly answering all of his questions and we quickly added the deep fried spring rolls to bring our order up to $25. The spring rolls were boring. The chicken with eggplant in a spicy basil sauce was not spicy, but bland. It was not worth $25."
139,Absolutely horrible. We came in on a Wednesday evening as a group of 6. We sat down immediately as they weren't too busy. We waited forever to get water and give our orders. I ordered an appetizer item-- spring rolls. Everyone else received AND finished their meal before I even laid eyes on mine. They didn't apologize and didn't remove it from the bill. It wasn't even good.Are you kidding me? I won't be back.
140,"Disappointing food. Had the pumpkin with chicken and basil - the pumpkin didn't have any other flavor besides pumpkin - the dish was bland and boring. The ""fresh"" roll was soggy and tasteless. The was their last chance."
141,"So sad - the quality has been going downhill for a while, and I've tried to overlook it. My favorite spicy beef salad is unrecognizable, its way smaller, with poor quality meat and totally different ingredients. what happened?"
142,"Yikes.  I used to like this place.  But the food has gone downhill.  The shrimp in our food weren't really deveined and they were way overcooked/dry.  Also, in our last takeout order they didn't give us any utensils.  We spent our time rushing around looking for forks instead of sitting down to eat right before work.  I think I'm pretty much done with this place.The most serious thing was on THREE separate occasions I have ordered food with no meat and received orders with chicken."
143,"After watching the movie: Wanted, my friends and I were hungry, and we stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe. I have never heard of this restaurant before so I didn't know what to expect. After looking over their menu, we ordered a few dishes. It took a while to order because the staff was standing around and chatting. Four people were at the counter talking and laughing. A person was cleaning the tables. And another person was preparing the food. The staff was friendly but not attentive. So, when we finally ordered, we wondered if our food would ever come. Fifteen minutes later, our three dishes were ready, I wasn't too excited. We ordered chicken, beef, rice, and Pad Thai which all came in small proportions. In addition, the dishes were bland, plain, and average. The price was about $8 per dish. Total of our meal was $27, which was reasonable. However, I'd feel this cafe deserves two stars and I wouldn't go back ever. I had much better Thai food elsewhere."
144,"Came here around 10 PM, was not busy. Less than 10 tables in this big restaurant. So many workers ( probably around 15) with many of them being hosts and waiters. Yet it took them 10 mins to take my order even though many of them were just standing around. I had to get a waiter's attention to take my order. I didn't get any napkins? Portion sizes are really small. For $8-12 a person, I expect to be filled. Yet for one dish, it charges $2 extra for 1 egg? Hmph. Waiter forgot my thai tea and I had to remind him. As I am eating while writing this review, I still have no napkin. So many workers just standing around, avoiding eye contact. They're always at the front counter just holding conversations. Bad service...small portions...not the best. Avoid going here. In summary: Over staffed, bad service, overpriced, under portioned."
145,"I love that it's open late and the service was  good and very attentive, but the food was sub-par. The crispy noodle rad bar was drowning in gravy, much too salty, and so soggy that I forgot it was supposed to be crispy. The roasted duck over rice had very little duck and a lot of rice. Also, the duck, although tender, was not crispy."
146,Place is so darn busy that the amazing waitress literally ran from table to table on the day I dined there.  Not exactly relaxing and yet impressive to watch.  Food was decent and relatively inexpensive.  Open kitchen and so very loud.  It is obviously under staffed for the volume of people that dine there.  Made me want to get up and take a few tables just to help out - so not exactly a relaxing meal when you have to watch the staff  jump through hoops to deliver your food to a table.
147,"If sweet chili sauce and cabbage garnish do the Thai food make, then Tuk Tuk fits the bill. But I wouldn't exactly say this is a keeper. Aside from the entertaining tuk-tuk inside the door, the space is austere and almost void of the statues, offerings, and framed portraits of monarchs we see in nearly every Thai eatery. Started with corn fritters, which were delicious and came with a sweet chili sauce and cabbage/carrot garnish. Next the classic Thai spring rolls and, yes, sweet chili sauce and cabbage/carrot garnish. A Thai BBQ chicken and papaya salad lunch special came with the soup of the day. Unfortunately that soup was a bland afterthought with a pinch of veggies and tofu. The chicken was another disappointment. In lieu of BBQ'ing (definitions aside) I'd say this quarter bird was broiled and she lacked any Thai flavor profile whatsoever. But wait! There was a sweet chili sauce on the side so it *must* be Thai. Papaya salad was a creative pairing and had all the flavors but lacked a marriage between ingredients. It tasted like it'd just been thrown together; on one hand you could argue it was ""fresh"" but on the other, it lacked depth. The was also the case with the side of cucumber salad which tasted like the veggies were just chopped and then dunked in a thick sugar & vinegar marinade.  Bottom line: I left the soup, the rice, and the unripe tomatoes from the papaya salad and brought home the chicken in hopes of turning it into a Caesar chicken salad. Maybe Mex-italian will suit this entree better."
148,"As a forward to the review, please note that I think this is my first one star review ever.This was never one of my favorites in the land of many quality thai restaurants, but I had a few friends that were way into TukTuk so I would often go.  It was ok, but for the price, not that inspiring.  Pluses: They offer a lot of vegetarian and vegan options; They did have a lunch special so that's nice, and it's very spacious, big enough for large parties. I went on Saturday and VEGANS Be Warned!  My guy ordered the praram tofu curry.  The curry sauce had a shrimp in it!  Now, not only is the guy vegan, but the last time he ingested a shrimp (long story) he spent the next 24 hours well...it was coming out both ends.  We ended up at Kaiser, where they wouldn't figure out what was wrong with him because they thought he was strung out or something, until suddenly someone figured out that it was shellfish poisoning.  The man scared the bejesus out of me, and we both thought he was about to die.Anyway, back to the restaurant; I'm trying to stay calm, and asking the staff to find out about the curry sauce (maybe one shrimp fell in; or did they actually use shrimp in the sauce, and just not mention it to the vegetarians....).  They said that they didn't put any shrimp in the sauce....but also couldn't explain how a shrimp got in there....well, I certainly hope they don't double dip if you know what I mean.   They weren't very helpful.  Only apologetic.   They did try to give us ice cream as consolation, but him being vegan, and both of us had already completely lost our appetites, well, who wants ice cream.Also, last bit of bad business practice (and this one really urked me, my family ran restaurants for decades, and you try to keep the customer happy if they're at all in the right)  they did not comp us our meal,  or even just his own dish, or any such thing.  Definitely not coming back!btw, he was fine; he spat everything out as soon as he pulled the tail out of his mouth, but he couldn't tell if he had eaten any shrimp (yeah, he was hungry that day)....but hours later nothing had happened, Whew!  That's why I wondered how a shrimp tail snuck into the big sauce pot......."
149,"Nobody needs to review this place anymore, but I have to add my own two-cents. S.O. and I have tried this place over and over since they opened. At first, it was okay, not great Thai food, but good enough, especially late at night since they are open late.  But the last few times we went, several things have been way off. First, when we order ""to go"" we get miniscule portions -- I mean a papaya salad should easily feed two people, and yet this one was just enough for me. An order of yellow chicken curry was barey enough for just my husband, and we're not gluttons by a long shot.On one visit, S.O. ordered a lunch special that offered a paltry cup full of rice and an equal amount of the chicken curry. He was still hungry, so I offered some of my food, even though I'd not gotten very much either. Fast forward to the last the visit: we're hungry, and happen to be in the neighborhood so we stop in. It's very busy, so we accept that the service is slow. The problem is that we are almost completely ignored for a very long time. No water for a long time, even. And after we decided what to order, we just sit and wait. S.O. goes out for an E.B. Express and an S.F. Guardian to keep us occupied (Yeah, we've been together so long we often don't free like talking). Eventually our order is taken, and eventually, we get our food. I'd ordered Larb Gai (ground chicken salad with chilis, onion on bed of lettuce) and S.O. got a noodle chicken, broccoli dish with ""gravy"" that he's never ordered before.My Larb came out with big chunks of chicken breast. Larb Gai is supposed to contain ground chicken, not chunks. And there was virtually no flavor in the dressing whatsoever. Except for the fried onions, this dish had nothing going for it. The chicken gravy thing was simply scary. A clump of rice noodles with some chicken breast and broccoli afloat in a huge amount of nasty, bland, nothing brown gravy. WTF? WTF is this shit? I call a waitress over and question the Larb. She agrees that it's not Larb, says there's a new chef, and takes it away. It comes back with chopped chunks of chicken, and the dressing has gone from nothing to less than nothing.  But now it has an abundance of some kind of ground up gritty stuff. I don't know what this is, but I know it is supposed to be there, but not as a prominent component. The salad is all nastiness. I hate it, and eat only enough to stave of my hunger pangs. S.O. struggles with his weird, nasty gravy shit and noodles so stuck together he would need a knife to get through them. He really hates it, and eats less than half, which is very unsual for him. He has to truly hate something in order to leave hungry. But this time, maybe the only time in our 13 year relationship, he leaves the restaurant hungry. Where's the salt/sweet/savory umame thing? Neither of our dishes is anywhere near palatable, even by a shiity Thai restaurant standard.  We ordered our food spicy, and it came out completely, utterly bland. Really, it was pathetic. At the end of this distasteful lunch, we waited and waited and waited for out check. Eventually even the ice in our water had disappeared and we just sat there, having finished our newpapers and having nothing else to drink. Finally, S.O. got up and paid the bill while a waiter came up to ask if I wanted the left-overs to go. No Thank You. I wouldn't feed this shit to my dog.I will never again frequent this horrible restaurant. I'd rather call Domino's pizza (which I intensely dislike) if I need a late-night snack. Thanks anyway. Mmm. buh-bye."
150,"went in here because it was open late and i wanted to try something different. the food was decent but me and a friend orderd 2 bluemoons and each 1 of ours tasted different mine was all waterd down and didnt taste like beer at all, i thought it was my taste buds acting up untill i seen 2 other people in the place sent there drinks back and when i asked the server (some young white dude) that my drink was not what it was suppose to be and can i just have a thai tea instead he made it seem like it was a problem to switch my drink! its not my fault that your beer tap was faulty.. def wont be comming back here ever!"
151,My friend and I decided to come here since there were some good reviews.When we first walked in a waiter walked right past us without saying hi and went right on to hang out with the other waiters. We waited in front for about 3 minutes and decided to just take a seat. As we were sitting down the same waiter walked to our table and said next time wait until we seat you. WTF you walked right past us when you should have seated us then. My friend and I just up and left. Why spend $ on a place that doesn't give you respect?Very rude and obnoxious.
152,"what I have ordered:Chopped beef larb (spicy) - not bad & the spice had a great kick. MSG attack within an hour or less after eating this entire dish.Beef Pad Se lew - not that great; nothing special and not enough flavorThai Spring Rolls - not bad, definitely tasted the taro fillingNeau Yang Num Tok aka Thinly sliced smoked beef salad - beef was bland and mediocre.Deep-fried banana w/ice cream - YUM & MUST ORDER!!"
153,"I've eaten at this place many times over the years. As is a common theme in other reviews, sometimes it can be decent, and sometimes inedible. So what prompted me to write a review saying that I will never return again? Well, the story goes something like this: I live a few blocks away, and desperately want to like this place. I keep going back, I guess because it became like a relationship... I'm the fool who thinks the other person can change and not hurt me again, so I keep giving it another chance. We've ordered different combinations of pad se iew, guey teaw lord, fried chicken over rice, Thai spring rolls, tod mun, and gai sa te many times in the past. Pretty basic stuff. However, I would say that at least a third of all our visits, both dine in and take out, have had something wrong with it. A rubber band in the noodles, chicken sa te so over cooked that it wouldn't come off the bamboo skewers and it tasted like cardboard, vegetables in the pad se iew that were so hard you couldn't bite through it, etc. The last straw came a few nights ago when we ordered take out for two. The guey teaw lord was fine. We also had an order of tod mun appetizer that tasted pasty and granular, and the chicken sa te was once again over cooked and dry, but edible. However, the fried chicken over fried rice? OMG! I was insulted. One fried chicken patty was a little over fried, but that's OK... i can live with that. The other fried chicken patty was so over fried, it was unidentifiable as chicken. The patty was so hard that my metal fork at home could not poke through. It almost appeared as if they had fried it once, left it out for the whole day, and then tried to fry it again. How hard is it to fry chicken??? I sometimes wonder what they think, or if they think at all.  ""Hmm, we have a to go order.  They probably won't know until they get home that the food we gave them was inedible.  Chances are they won't come back to return it because it would take too long.  Yeah, let's screw them with our crappy food.""  You, the people of Tuk Tuk Thai, should be thinking: ""Would a normal person eat this,"" and serve accordingly.Perhaps the reason why I'm so harsh in this review and go so far as to say I will never go back is because a few nights prior to eating at Tuk Tuk Thai I ate at King of Thai in San Francisco on Clement. (Same style restaurant: late night cheap Thai food.) We ordered the exact same items that we had at Tuk Tuk Thai, and there was no comparison. The noodles were tasty, the meat was plentiful, the tod mun had good taste and texture, and the chicken sa te was so soft and tender it melted in my mouth. I have to say that at the other place, the food was made with love. Here at Tuk Tuk Thai, the food quality and the pride is only an after thought. I'll take my $30+ and spend it elsewhere, thank you very much. Good luck to those who continue to eat here by choice, and may you never have the same experience that I did.  But just like gambling in casinos, the odds are in their favor.  Consider yourself warned!"
154,"I have eaten a several different Thai restaurants and this one is pricey and the food is not all that great, almost like they are skimping on the recipes that make Thai food taste so good.  service is good, and open late is a plus, but after my second visit there, I really do not see what all the fuss was about. will I go back, no."
155,"Not reccomended, our food was oily and the seafood and tofu were not fresh.  Our service was also not good, there are many good Thai places in the Bay Area, this is not one of them.  We will never be back!I reccomend Gecko Gecko in the same area, really nice atmosphere and fresh, delicious food, great for vegetarians/vegans and omnis."
156,"If you are looking for a heavy bitchy attitude, slow service, smoky place, and flavorless food, then this is the place! There are dozens of thai places to choose from in Berkeley. Please make yourself a favor and don't waste your time here!"
157,"I'm usually a big fan of thai food, but this place was a bit of a disappointment to me. The potstickers they have taste a little stale and dried up, and the seafood noodle soup tasted like some kind of tomato soup. Plus the menu was a little misleading and I ordered a combination that was a little steep in price. However, one of the ladies was nice enough to get me a discount."
158,"I'm giving this review an extra star because our waiter was sweet and attentive. We ordered three distinct (according to the menu) dishes. The three plates tasted and looked identical. There was only one detectable flavor: salt. There was one color: brown. My two conpanions left feeling uncomfortably full, still hungry, and ripped off."
159,"One star for the food, one star for being able to get thai until 1am.  I never come here unless absolutely every other similar option is closed.  It's not horrible...I've never gotten food poisoning or anything.  It just tastes like there are 2 cups of sugar in every dish. I know many thai dishes have a sweet component, but I don't like eating desert for dinner.  Nevertheless, Tuk Tuk has been known to hit the spot after a particularly violent death metal show or two."
160,"What a horrible, horrible place. This review isn't being written for my own good; it's for your own goodTried: Wonton soup filled with meat that tasted WAY off and something with a lot of peanut sauce that might have had beef in it. It was late, I was tired and hungry. For some reason I thought this place might have reasonable food. The place was crowded and the only reason I can think of why is because nowhere else within 6 blocks is open at 12:30am.Please spare yourself the pain and suffering of the Tuk Tuk Thai experience."
161,Food was not good. Below average Thai. Meh.
162,"I usually come to tuk tuk thai with my laptop when I need to do my laundry next door or have some lunch and work a little. Today, just like any other day, I came in and sat down with my boyfriend to have some lunch and do some work. I asked them for the internet code, and it turns out that they stopped giving the internet code to their customers. Why? Because they couldn't flip their tables fast enough... even though they have like 50 tables in this place. I just thought it was not cool to take away something that had me coming here for awhile. Many cafes give out free wireless to their customers, even though they know that these customers will be spending more time there.They ended up giving me an internet / wireless code... but I felt rushed throughout my entire meal. As soon as our plate was almost done, they asked us to pay the bill. Then they cleared our table immediately after we sat back. I left cash tip on the table, and they even took that in a hurry. Also, one of the servers made a mistake and gave us another table's spring roll. I didn't really think about it, and thought it might even come with our lunch special. Then a server came saying that the rolls were not for us. They made us pay for the spring rolls anyway. Overall, I was disappointed. Usually this place is really chill. I am compelled to tell those who come here for a relaxing cafe- type atmosphere... that they won't find it anymore!"
163,"Being open past 10pm does not automatically rate you extra stars anymore.   It's like giving five starts to the ugly person you brought home from the bar, just because they came home with you.  At 4am, when they're snoring away, and drooling on your pillow, you suddenly remember the actual five star people you've been with.  You now feel even worse, wishing you'd just come home and pounded some water and aspirin while you watched cartoons for a couple hours. Tuk-Tuk Thai is just like that, but with noodles.  Add to the mix an over done interior (that's quickly losing it's battle with grease and spilled sauce), and the usual bad Berkeley experiences (9 million hyper-dickish cops everywhere, parking nightmares, and stoned college students who think they're all that just because they're talking a poli-sci class and don't live with their mommy anymore). They get one extra star for having a real Tuk-Tuk in the restaurant.  Then again, Lanesplitter has motorcycles, serves food  late as well, and has beer.  Given those factors, I'd say unless you must have Thai for a late night food run, or you're too drunk to care and won't regret it in the morning, this is a pass."
164,"Boo. The lunch special I had was very sad indeed. I was very happy about the forbidden rice, but the green curry just plain sucked. I couldn't find any spice if I was a ""nearsighted buffalo on a flavor stampede"". I really wanted to like it, but it was neither cheap nor tasty. Also the frozen veg (you know the corn, pea, carrot, lima bean mix?)in the cabbage soup?  COME ON!! Really. Sad."
165,"I had the mixed pineapple fried rice.  The price was reasonable, it tasted good, 20 min later my stomach became upset...and lasted the whole night.  To add insult to injury, I was watching The Last Exorcism with my friends.  Having an upset stomach and watching someone possessed by the devil isn't a desirable tandem.  My friend who also ate there, had stomach problems also.  No wonder the food came out so fast, food was barely cooked!"
166,"I help old people cross the streets.  Puppies love me.  I let people cut in front of me at grocery stores if I see they have just one or two items.  A butterfly landed on me once after the rain, with a rainbow blanketing the background.  It startled me and I brushed it off hastily, by reflex, accidentally killing it - but the point is that I am usually a very tranquil, mellow guy. So why is it that each time I visit Tuk Tuk Thai my right eye would begin to twitch and I'll flip to carnage mode?  That's right.  It IS because they take forty minutes to take your order, an hour to bring you your food and another forty minutes to bring you your check - and this is AFTER you ask them very kindly to bring you your check because you were done with your food about twenty minutes ago.A simple addition comes to 160 minutes of waiting. Okay, that's me exaggerating a little... but you'll waste at least an hour just waiting around.  That's no joke.No small mammals are safe when you see me swing my arms back and forth and make throaty noises, trying to get the staffs' attention."
167,"Warning all vegetarians...I hate to give this place such a poor rating because I have had some really great food from there. That being said, for the SECOND time I have ordered a vegetarian dish to go, only to find meat in when I opened it! I know that sometimes orders get mixed up, but 2 times? Meat in my veggie dish is a big deal and I was not in the restaurant to have them fix it, so I missed out on dinner AND money...twice.There food is tasty and cheap, but make sure you have a chance to look at what you are eating before you take a bite!"
168,"Yuck yuck Tuk!.  I cruised Shattuck looking for an alternative to Venus (who was closed on New Year's Day) and reluctantly settled for Tuk Tuk.  Damn.  I wish I had just gone to Safeway (Whole Foods was closed) and made my own dinner.  Service was horrible because there was none, and they overcharged me $4.50 for a cup, not a bowl, of soup.  The decor (words painted on the ceiling was contrived (modern?) and the ambiance was actually more bland than warm).The only redeeming thing was that the eggplant with my shrimp was nicely done -- crispy skin and tender pulp.  Tsk tsk ... this could have been a pleasant surprise."
169,"Food is good, service is HORRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't ever get take out from Tuk Tuk - You won't get your correct order, and when you com e back to correct it, they make you pay for a new order and say your stealing if you don't. I'm a pretty reasonable person, but I was absolutely livid when going here twice!!!!But like I said, food is good. Once you reorder though, they will burn it on purpose."
170,"Customer Service is horrible. It took four calls and two days to get a refund for food that wasn't delivered, and no one ever apologized.I ordered delivery online through their website. 2 hours later FOOD STILL HAD NOT ARRIVED. I called to see what was going on, and the person who picked up couldn't ""access the record:"" of my purchase, took my information and promised to give me a call back to find out what happened. An hour and a half passed, no call. So I call back, just before closing, someone picks up and hangs up immediately without talking. I call back the next day, get someone else, who also won't give their name, and took all my information again. Again, no call back. I finally had to call back again and threaten with calling the police, at which point they offered to give a refund. No apology, no explanation, nothing. I still haven't gotten the refund, but they've lost my business for sure."
171,"The food was average, the service is a bit on the slower side.  The cleanliness is a huge question.  In the 30 minutes that we sat at this restaurant, we saw 3 cooks go in to the bathroom with their cooking gloves on and these same exact gloves were still on after they used the bathroom.  THAT IS DISGUSTING!!!!!!  For this reason, we will NEVER go back to eat at this restaurant.  YUCK!"
172,"At best, this place is mediocre. I went here twice, hoping that the first time I went, they were just having an off night, or that I simply didn't order what they did best. My favorite kind of Thai food are the noodle dishes, and if a Thai place doesn't do noodles well, then they are simply not worth my time.I have eaten or sampled three noodle dishes: Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao (maybe), and one other that I cannot remember. All three were weak on flavor and the ingredients appeared shriveled. Oily noodles don't bother me at all, so I'd never be put off by it, but the opposite actually does put me off. When the dishes were brought out, the noodles had clearly been sitting around for a short while, making them stick to each other a little too much, and when I tried to pull some away from the plate, they would break and slingshot the sauce onto the table top. Both times I went, my companions had gotten some kind of meat-veggie-rice combination which seemed better, but when I tried it, I too found those to be on the bland side. The best part of the entire dining experience was looking at the old-timey car that just sits in the middle of the floor. Otherwise, it deserves an ""eh."""
173,"Terrible service!  I ordered for delivery and was told it would be a half hour.  45 minutes later I called to see where the order was.  The woman who answered said 20 more minutes.  An hour after I ordered, the delivery man shows up and quickly leaves before I can realize I have someone else's order.  My order was $45 worth of food, this one is $20 worth of food, and my colleagues, who were super hungry after a big work day were super disappointed.  My colleagues felt bad because they recommended we order from this place.  I took the food all the way back to the restaurant and the wait staff could care less.  There were no apologies.  One of the wait staff called the manager and the manager talked to me saying he could refund my money when he's back at the store next but not now.  I wanted a refund on the spot- you make me wait an hour, bring me the wrong order, then have the gall to not refund my money?  I don't have confidence on getting the refund, so I contacted my bank.  What a terrible experience!  Makes me wonder what else in their restaurant is being done sub par...  There are about a dozen Thai restaurants in Berkeley, and I recommend going to any one of them but this one."
174,"+ Open late+ Cheap food+ Large selection- It tastes like cheap food- Someone always spends an hour on the toilet afterwards- Bad serviceThere are so many better Thai places in Berkeley (Cha-Am, Thai House, Plearn) why are you at Tuk Tuk (Or, as I like to call it, Tuk Yuck Thai)?!  I hope it's because it's 2am, you've had too much to drink and you didn't know any better."
175,"I don't know why people think this place is good.  You can eat the food and not get sick and the prices are reasonable, at least the times I went at lunch time.I had the pumpkin curry that everyone else thought was good.  It had about 1 inch cubes of pumpkin in it that were not in the least bit soft.  It's like they chopped up a raw pumpkin and threw pieces in and cooked it for only a few minutes. Crunchy raw gag.  If I get squash or pumpkin it would be nice if it was cooked.  The sauce was not flavorful or delicious for the curry, either.The pad thai was at least cheaper and had better flavor, but still not all that great.  The atmosphere was nothing to speak of and I really don't care if there is a Tuk Tuk, or a cart, or a car, or a boat or any form of transportation sitting in the middle of the restaurant.I thought my food at Thai Noodle was better and it's open just as late.  Plearn on University Ave was also better.  Actually most Thai places I've tried in Berkeley were better.I can put up with it if friends want to go there, but I know I won't really enjoy my meal much and that it will be bland and unappealing and possibly un(der)cooked."
176,"I've eaten a lot of Thai food, some excellent, some good, some not so good. How hard can it be? Tuk tuk didn't hit the mark for me. The yellow curry was kinda bland, even when we asked for 'medium spicy'. And I usually measure a good thai meal by their red/yellow/green curries - these are the basics and they should be right! Having said that, I'll still go there because it's reasonably priced, open late, and has a cool rikshaw in the middle of the restaurant!"
177,"a.k.a. Yuck! What the fuck? This sucks!ok. yeah, I ate it it. I was hungry and a bit buzzed, and had a shitty night!But to end it with this crap?! Bland food that took too long!.And then I get the bill? Only made me more pissed off! Then I had to walk about 5 block for a freaking cab!!! It's a good thing the cabby was one of my favorite dudes.The only thing good about this place is it's open after midnight.The only thing good about today is fact that  ""a"" adores me, and I got my new no.1 10.5 driver."
178,"Rather bland and unexciting Thai place. I had the Pad Thai which was nothing to write home about. My son had the Chicken Noodle Soup, which was bland, while my girlfriend had the steak, which was pounded flank steak, overcooked and stringy. Would not go back."
179,"The food was standard Thai.  I enjoyed the meal itself BUT I haven't experienced such bad service in my life.  We were a party of six which is completely manageable.  They brought out the first dish but didn't know who ordered what.  We couldn't hear what the food runner  called out so she rolled her eyes and basically slammed down the plate.  A few minutes later she came up to me and barked, ""that's not your food.""  Apparently my friend and I had both ordered sweet and sour chicken but his was a house special.  How was I to know the difference when we were at different ends of the table?  Our waiter now returned to reprimand me as well telling me, ""since you started to eat that you have to pay for it.""  This most certainly was not our fault but in any case what happened to the customer always being right?  Absolutely ridiculous."
180,"So-so thai food for lunch that tries to be a bit pretentious.  The soup is nice and sour, and not too spicy.  Service can be a bit slow or inept - I had the papaya salad/bbq chicken, but they mixed up my dish, and the sticky rice actually had a hair in it, a rather long one in fact.  Ick.  And it was kind of dry (even if it was stored in saran wrap).  Oh well, I hope I just caught them on an off day.  Lunch dishes are $7-9, thai ice tea is $1.50.  Seems they also include the tip if your party is more than 6 people, so be careful not to overtip."
181,"this is a pretty good place if it was the last thai place in berkeley. now, the food was okay, but the price was high for what it was worth. i didnt have a bad experience at the place, in fact my best friend introduce the place to me years ago and we've been going there since. until recently we found out a nearby thai food place called the THAINOODLE on the opposite end on town. compared to THAINOODLE, this is place is night and day. the food in TUK TUK was small in portion, salty, and garnished with a BUNCH of shredded carrots and some green lettuce to fill the remaining space of the togo box...hysterical when i opened the box when i got home. overall, so-so, im still disappointed. addendum: it make a difference when you know what quality is compared to mediocre."
182,"The only reason they get one star is because I have to give a star in order to post a review...... YES, it's that bad. I went to lunch with my mother and husband and mother found a seat by the window, it was a nice day and we waited and waited and waited until my husband got up and asked if we could see a menu...there were 2 other people in the entire place, WTF?? So, the menu comes, we wait and wait and wait-do you see a trend here? My husband yells across the place that we would like to order and if it wouldn't be too much trouble...We wait again for the food. They bring my mother's food, my husbands food and not mine. I wait and wait and wait for 10 minutes, by 11 minutes I was furious. I get up and walk over to the counter area where I see my plate of food sitting there while all the staff is chatting away in Thai. I say ""CAN I HAVE MY FOOD? OR ARE YOU TOO BUSY TALKING RIGHT NOW?"" I walk away assuming my food will be right behind me, but sadly no. I sit down and they continue talking.....I exploded we left, they wanted me to pay for my food-that I never got?? We told them to F*&K off and we will never go there again. My mother was a wreck, my husband was completely irritated and we had to go eat somewhere else. To clarify the food is not terrible it's okay for a quick meal, but having to deal with that crappy service..I think not. I will never go there again and unless you want to have an exercise in frustration I suggest that you don't go either."
183,"Tuk Tuk gets high marks for being open late and pretty cool decor. The restaurant has a tuk tuk in the middle which is fun and endearing.If you want spicy thai food, you're likely to leave disapointed. No matter how much I try to convince them, I can't seem to get a Tom Kha Ghai soup sufficiently spicy. (Spicy Tom Kha Ghai is my secret remedy for head conjestion). If you're vegan, inspect your dish carefully. My vegan neighbors weren't convinced their last couple meals there started off vegan.Even though I rate it two stars, I *do* like this place. The low rating reflects the general trajectory of the place: it's not getting better. It's getting the opposite of better."
184,"Tuk Tuk Thai is so mediocre.  The only reason I go there is because of the location (close to a friends place) and the hours.  The service is terrible (think, they come by, get your order, bring your food, bring the check).  No complaining allowed.I also think I had several pieces of undercooked chicken in my Pad Thai.  Disgusting."
185,"The food here is sometimes good, sometimes okay, and sometimes bad. Service is mostly bad... seems like staff rotates out quickly, so no one cares. There's so many Thai places in town... I recommend trying them and avoiding this place."
186,"Can you give a place 0 stars? Because that is what this place deserves. It's not only the worst Thai food I have ever had but the worst meal I have had in ages! The chicken dish was old, dry and inedible. The sticky rice tasted like cigarettes. The noodles were blah but the worst was the 7 people standing around without offering water or checking to make sure everything was okay. I love Thai food and this was a slap in the face. When we complained, which I never do, they offered to take off my husbands driink. That was the only thing worth paying for. Skip this place. They don't even have the tuk tuk anymore."
187,I heard this place was good so i  came here with my friend the food was all bad.  I ordered the fried rice with beef and it was very bland my friend ordered the Chicken fried rice  and when he bit into the chicken it was cold and uncooked.  Never been back since oh yea and parking sucks too.
188,"If you're looking for Thai food in Berkeley, you have a lot of other options that are better/more authentic tasting than this place......(cha'am....thai house...) Their bbq chicken is ok...It's not like I experienced anything horrible... I think the service was okay too....I would just never pick this place....(Remember on yelp, 2 stars = ""Meh. I've experienced better"")"
189,"I really wish I had read the reviews on yelp before I chose this restaurant for dinner. My bf and I ordered a fresh shrimp/spring rolls appetizer and we thought it tasted very strange after a few bites. We sent it back and the waiter replaced it with fried spring rolls. I threw up later that night from the spring roll, I am pretty sure it had spoiled sometime after preparing or before they served it to us. I don't understand why they can't use fresh ingredients in their food...Needless to say, I won't be coming back. I gave them one extra start because at least they didn't charge us for the spring rolls that we sent back to the kitchen."
190,"There is really no reason to come here other than for the convenience (location or restaurant hours). The food is mediocre, the prices are not especially cheap. Most importantly, expect the most AWFUL service i have ever experience in Berkeley if you come here late at night (after 10pm). Many times my friends and I have come here to get a late night snack and we got nothing but rudeness. Service is fine during the day."
191,"I don't know if I've rated this place before, but the service today was absolutely terrible. I called in my order, went there, waited around for someone to even recognize that I was actually there for something other than to act as a statue...I then watched my order being served to someone who wondered why they were getting pad thai. I'll never go back to this place.  and by the way, everyone who worked there seemed really pissed off."
192,oh my god! there's a fly in the soup. not kidding. the staff had the audacity to give me  a discount on the soup. what the hell? an effing discount?are you kidding me? not going back to that place even if they pay me to eat there.
193,"We hadn't been to Tuk Tuk Thai in well over a year, since it underwent a makeover, i.e. new paint, new menu, new lighting fixtures, etc. It's not the place it used to be. The service was slow. Maybe we ticked the waiter off because we didn't know immediately what we wanted to order and he  had to make two trips to take our order. The food was just okay and the amount of food paltry. We would've gladly paid for more food."
194,"Shame on you yelpers that think so highly of this place! It's sad that you can't give negative stars. The service here was truly abysmal. We didn't really have a designated server, instead the delivery driver came to take our order then somebody else came to tell us the beer we ordered was unavailable followed by a third person to deliver the food to us. Our final visit to the table occurred only after we got up to get our own to go boxes. Then and ONLY then did somebody come over to ask if we wanted another box and to give us the check. What a joke! The food was mediocre and hopefully will be a bit better as leftovers. Don't waste your time or money unless you just don't give a crap about either."
195,"Well, my first experience at Tuk Tuk started with a spring roll appetizer which had a not so appetizing hair in it. Needless to say, my experience went downhill from there. I think overall, the food would have been ok if not for the hair. The curry I ate there was ok, but given the numerous other Thai places in the Bay area, I dont' see why I would really go back. It's cheap, but not worth worrying about having hair in my food."
196,"This is a noisy, charmless, box-like place with food that's fair to good. Bad acoustics, zero atmosphere except for the authentic ""Tuk Tuk"" (open-air taxi) from Bangkok that sits in the dining room. I got a bad vibe as soon as I walked in and asked for the men's room. It was dirty and when I told a waiter there was no hand soap or paper towels he looked at me as if to say ""And your point is....?"" Generally bad service from a young and indifferent staff."
197,"Went with a large group to Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe. They were very accommodating and I was pleased with the service. As for the food, it was sub par. I got the green curry dish, which I thought was rather bland. I didn't even like their plum sauce."
198,"Horrible.  I gave them an extra star cause the Tuk Tuk in the middle is cool. Shrimp rolls came out wrapped in this huge glutenous noodle instead of rice paper.  The Po Tak (Seafood soup) was lukewarm, flavorless and actually had some breaded fish in it  - disgusting.  The Calamari salad was nothing but iceberg. Service is very uneven.  They list like 10 different wines (good), but had one of them (bad). Ordered a Pinot Grigio but got a Chardonnay, and when I asked about it they insisted they had poured me the Pinot Grigio.  Yeah I know, I shouldn't expect fine wine at a place like this.  Okay then, don't freakin' offer it.  Please go away, or find a chef who gives a damn."
199,"+points for being open late.+points for being in central Berkeley location.-points for NEVER being consistent.-points for IGNORING you(having to flag someone down especially  when ordering to-go)-points for telling me they won't serve me something that i ask for, looking at me strange for it and asking me why would i want that(since i was vegan i have asked every Thai place i go to to serve me Thai iced tea with coconut milk not cream--it actually tastes really good and everywhere has happily served that to me---tuk tuk servers--and I've asked on multiple occasion laugh at me and say no, um they f*ing say NO???WTF!!)i only go here when I'm desperate."
200,"We've taken advantage of their late hours and delivery service many times. Sometimes the curries are rich and flavorful. But too often they seem thrown together at the last minute so that meat, vegetables and curry are not integrated. The consistency problem is also apparent in the  service. Sometimes it's fine, but the last time we were there it was unbearably slow and there were only a few other diners. There are so many other options for Thai, I think we might have to call it quits with Tuk Tuk."
201,"As mentioned in M.H.'s review, employees do not wash their hands after using the bathroom. DISGUSTING!The City of Berkeley health inspector cited this place for major health code violations in June 2009. One of them was for ""Poor Personal Hygeine"" (Definition: ""An employee not washing their hands after using the restroom or handling food with open sores or cuts."")Anyone who wants to see the report online can go here: ci.berkeley.ca.us/enviro…"
202,"Don't even bother! Below average food and  LOUD music from cheap speakers blarring throughout  dinner. And, don't bother requesting management to turn the music down because management will promptly inform you to leave if you don't like it!  We left and glad we did.  In years past, I've sent many visiting students to this restaurant.  NEVER AGAIN!  NEVER AGAIN!"
203,"So, have had a delivery order in the past that was so-so in terms of service and pretty  mediocre in terms of quality, flavor, and amount of food.  Last night, I called to order because a friend wanted thai and the guy strongly urged me to use the website as it ""would be faster and easier"".  Okay, I decide to go along with that begrudgingly and get online and start doing so, and just as I am submitting the order, it says is too late for delivery orders.  I call and tell him that he had just sent me to the website which now would not take my order, and he says that yeah, they stop taking delivery orders at 9:45.  Granted, it probably took me 5-10 mins to complete and try to submit the order.  I asked why he didn't tell me that when I was just on the phone, and he hung up on me.  Seriously- how rude to waste someone's time like that, whether you want to take one last order or not.  And, also after going thru this, it was too late to get food from most other places and my hungry guests and I were pretty annoyed.  Never again."
204,This place is AWFUL! don't ever order food from here! after 2 hours of waiting we still didn't have food. We ended up cancelling the order.
205,"The hot wings disabled my taste buds for a week and made me cry.  Other than that, its okay.  Service was good."
206,"i come here when a late night craving for thai food hits [when usually most other thai places and other restaurants are already closed]. decent thai food, effecient service, and opens late [2am]. hence, the 2 stars.----5 stars: i am a loyal customer and cannot live without this place/restaurant!4 stars: consistently great food. a place i would definitely frequent if i dont already.3 stars: good food. id come back for more if a particular craving for something specific they offer hit me. 2 stars: for the sheer reason of convenience and semi mediocre food [but convenience being the majority of reason] id come back.1 star: id never be caught dead in the place ever ever again."
207,Been getting take outs for over a year here. Quality has gone down the chute. Just ordered two pad see yew tonite and when I got home opened them they smelled like burnt severely. You can smell the smell of smoke! Never going to go back again.
208,"This is a place i want to like. I really do. I really really do. But the food is bland and americanized. No spice and too much sugar. But the prices are right, the staff is friendly, so if friends were going here i wouldnt decline."
209,"The food is mediocre and when the bill arrived, they had added an automatic 20% gratuity for a party of 5.  They only brought us our food. They didn't even refill our water water glasses. Service? Yeah, right."
210,"No matter how convenient it is that this place is open late, I simply cannot eat here anymore.I have gotten chicken dishes where the chicken was not cooked.  Or where it was so old that it was sour (!) and inedible.  Or spring rolls where parts of the wrapper were stiff as cardboard and unchewable.But what really gets me is this one waiter who is really rude.  He refused to give me full change, instead just asking me how much more tip did I want to give over the change I was handing him.  When I complained to one of the other waiters, the other waiter said ""We have complaints about that guy; I'll talk to him"" but the first waiter still works there.Tonight, that same waiter rested his arm on a stack of ""clean"" dishes to be used for the customers.  I told the head waiter that this other waiter had just rested his arm on a stack of clean dishes and the top dish was no longer clean.  The head waiter just ignored me.  I got rid of the dish, but it was a disgusting experience."
211,"Yes-the tuk tuk in the middle of the restaurant  is what drew me in.After the meal I went running out-never to return.Gooey white wrappers around bad shrimp.Pad Thai-my benchmark dish- was inedible.Went into the men's room,since the ladies room was in use--big mistake!Service was fairly bad."
212,"After several years of driving by and noticing this place when I wasn't hungry,  I finally stopped in today on the theory that to have survived in a foody town like Berkeley they must be ok.And they are.  But that's it:  just ok.  The shrimp rolls were -- and tasted mostly like -- iceberg lettuce.  Not a lot of shrimp,  or even a lot of mint.  The wrappers were thick and gummy,  and the sauce was jammy -- closer to the stuff you get with takeout Chinese in packets labelled ""Duck Sauce"" than anything I've had in other Thai places.The broth in the wonton soup was *excellent*,  and the BBQ pork floating around in it was up to local standards.  But the wontons themselves were nothing to write home about.  Hey, the dish is named after them!  I don't know what's *authentic* for Thai food,  so maybe it's supposed to be that way.I came away full,  and I'm sure if I lived across the street I'd end up eating here a lot since they're open late.  But with Thai Noodle (10ish blocks north on the other side of University,  same price range) around it's pretty unlikely I'll eat here again."
213,The food was alright but was great nor was good. The service was good but too bad the food didnt wow me. I've had alot better thai food elsewhere. I would not come back here again.
214,"Used to eat here alot like a few years back like every week, but the food portions started getting smaller and the service was pretty bad the last time I went. I brought friends to the restaurant because I said it was pretty good. I was really embarrassed because of the poor service and small portions. Giving it two because of the past, but really don't recommend it now."
215,"VERY BAD FOOD VERY BAD SERVICEMy stories (2 out of 6 visits)first:Hair in my meal. I got some chicken cutlet curry thing to go, found a hair, went back. they gave me a new meal. Second: I went there with my girlfriend. We ordered spring roll and some thick noodle dish with chilli pepper. THERE WAS A FLY IN MY GF's THICK RICE NOODLE. We did NOT have cash but credit card. they didnt take the credit card. what do they want us to do? get another dish. YEH RIGHT. And this skinny guy (5"" 10')ish with short black hair (the waiter) did not even apologize to us, and gets frustrated on his own. says ""WHAT THE F"" to us and yells at my girlfriend about the credit card payment.  so we get pissed. go up there and ask for an apology. The cashier apologizes to us but that guy doesn't. we came out, but felt really crappy. went back in and asked him only for a polite apology to my girlfriend for yelling at her. He refuses and the whole tuk tuk thai workers threatened me that they are gonna call cops on us. End of story.I am telling EVERYONE of my friends not to go to tuk tuk thai ever again."
216,"A few years ago, I tried Tuk Tuk Thai. I don't remember what I had, but it gave me the runs, so I avoided going back until tonight. A few nights ago, I was grossed out by the dirty floor of my otherwise favorite thai dive, Thai Noodles, and I wanted to try something different. I thought that perhaps I had had a rare experience the last time at Tuk Tuk Thai, so based on reviews, and the 15 or so diners inside at 10:30 tonight, I decided to give it another try. Unfortunately, the Chicken Pad King, and sticky rice I had gave me uncontrollable runs again, even worse this time. GROSS! Less than 30 minutes after I started eating, it went right through me all of a sudden! I didn't even close to make it to the bathroom in time. I'm sooooo glad I got it to go!I realize that this is a pretty graphic review, and I apologize for that. However, I truly wish I'd read one just like it before going there tonight. If I had known, I definitely would have gone elsewhere. Now my stomach is hurting, and I'm ready to dart back to the bathroom at any moment. NOT COOL! At least I've never gotten sick from the food at Thai Noodles, and I've eaten there well over 100 times -- probably over 200! What does one do in this kind of situation? I'm thinking about going back tomorrow and speaking to the manager, but maybe I'll just send an email to the health department after I'm done writing this review. are you reading, Tuk Tuk? Here's your heads up!Edited: I only awarded one star because you have to click at least one to post a review."
217,"this place would have gotten at least 4 stars but i had to chop two off and im being generous just giving them one of those two after my experience the other day....i used to go here all the time when i lived in berkeley on milvia right down the street but i would always go at night pretty late because it is open until 2 am...the night time staff was always friendly and the food was always good i always bought the bbq pork wich was a decent serving of food and always left me full and satsfied afterwards but this was about 2 years ago...i went about a week ago with my gf and my nephew and she ordered the eggplant lunch special while i ordered an appetizer of calamari and me and my nephew ordered the bbq pork.there was NOONE in the restaraunt yet the waitress NEVER came to fill our glass of water not one time.. when the calamari came it was fried in some batter that had the consistency of popeyes chicken strips batter but it was relatively flavorless... only the spicy sweet and sour sauce made it worth eating truthfullythen when our food came my gf had never recieved her hot and sour soup or rice that supposedly came with the lunch special she ordered.  and we never got any refills on water after walking all around berkeley that day we were pretty annoyed with the staff...especially watching them have conversations with eachother like they hadnt seen eachother in years or something..the BBQ pork was more fat then meat... horrible quality ingredients..the sauce on the meet was slathered on there way too much and it was too strong for my taste...not like it used to be definitelythen when we got the check FINALLY cuz we were ready to go...for what my GF ordered they charged us about 1.00 more than what we had actually ordered,... to find out that the waiter completeley didnt care what we had ordered because we showed him it on the lunch special menu AND said the name of it... he really didnt give a sh**if u ask me... then the waitress had the nerve to get an attitude when we complained about it... i really was fed up with this place by then just because of that experience i will never go back there and id advise other people to be careful of some of the staff here they seem a lil grimey"
218,yeah i dont know what happened here. it used to be my firs choice but then literally i came in one day and it was pretty awful. from then i went maybe 3-4 more times praying for better results every time but alas i was set up for disappointment. dont bother. little plearn a block north is always a better choice.
219,"I have tried so many Thai restaurants and this one is at the bottom of the pile.  First of all, I ordered takeout and the cashier was rude and impatient.  I wasn't taking a long time to order and it wasn't even busy.  I've worked in restaurants, I know the drill.  I could deal with that if the food was great, but the pad thai was basically just noodles with sauce-mushy and bland.  I also ordered it vegetarian and got shrimp.  There was another dish that I was assured was not spicy and it had giant chunks of hot red peppers in it.  This is the fourth time I've tried this place.  I give up."
220,let me start by saying the food is great very small portions i have been to this resturaunt 4 diff times in hopes that there service would get better its almost as if they are ignoring you purposely you have to flag down for water you have to flag down for refills on thai ice tea i said if i cant get service i wont go back and ive been back bneacause of the food its true they come straight from bathroom to kitchen bathroom is not clean but irst and formost i cant stress enough service is terrible but when its time to pay bill there quick and efficient. i was there the other day and one waiter was playing with eyepod i came in was seated and it litterally took 5 minutes to take my order.anytime you have to call people for service thats bad. they need serious training in cust service and put some ice in the water!!!!!!
