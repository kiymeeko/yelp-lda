0,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
1,DON'T GO IF YOU'RE VEGANTheir version of vegan pizza is sad oily bread with no sauce and no cheese substitute. It's like they're punishing you for hoping that you can get a vegan pizza there. If you want vegan pizza out Pieology and Blaze Pizza offer vegan cheese options.
2,"Maybe it's not you, maybe it's me + Markus, but we never want to come back here again. I can see why people (more like college students) love coming here for their ginormous pizza for $20. I told pooperface Markus I wanted a slice and he goes getting a whole damn pizza that we only ate one slice and wanted to throw away the rest. The pizza was chewy, hard, and bland. Even the cilantro sauce didn't help make the pizza any better. Since we didn't want to waste the food, I try to give it to the homeless and they didn't even want it. He said, ""It's hard on my teeth"" BUAHAHA!! I'm glad I'm not the only one NOT diggin' this place!Life is too short to being eating tasteless pizza. Next!!!"
3,Pizza amazing BUT THIS PLACE IS FILTHY!!! and not just a need to wipe tables like years of grime and grease. My advice get pizza to go and make sure it's been in the oven for awhile.
4,"This place is usually really busy, but I finally got a chance to try it on kind of an off day. Unfortunately, this meant that I got crusty, old pizza. I feel very strongly that if you only make one type of pizza each day, you should really be nailing that ONE THING. Customers should pretty much be guaranteed pizza right out of the oven. I guess what a simplified menu really means is that they don't throw anything away until the end of the day. That really sucks.The green sauce is pretty tasty though."
5,"This update is with respect to Guillermo's --Sliver Owner-- response to the review. I changed the rating to 1 star primarily due to  the owner's argument: Sliver's founders are former Cheese Board members who, ""took elements [they] appreciated while changing things to make  Sliver [their] own."" And how this technique, ""is pretty common in the business world, and all the points [I] mentioned are fairly common across different restaurants.""Guillermo, your argument is ridiculous. Cheese Board is unique. As you yourself just said: you ""took"" away from that. You took it.I'm sure you've read Yelpers' reviews.  Don't get me wrong, they are positive. But they overwhelmingly--with near absolute universal consensus--indicate how your establishment is identical to Cheese Board. (And sadly there are so, so many who argue on Yelp that they believe Cheese Board and Sliver are the same thing, or that one is directly affiliated or branched off with the other). Sliver is a copy & paste of somebody else's hard work, and you should be ashamed of yourself. While I appreciate you taking the time to explain what's up...look, you said it, you ""took."" So kudos on adding a television and bar... But you ""took"" something, and then changed the name. You're doing the same thing as Cheese Board, less the collective part of it.  You even ""took"" Cheese Board's signature, the extra sliver of pizza. What is the name of your business again? I won't even bother getting into the philosophical debate with respect to privatizing elements of a collective ( that you used to be a part of?). It's shady, man. You guys opened the same business, right down the road. Who does that? I'm sorry if you think I'm being critical, but these are your words; this is your business strategy. The fact that you cannot recognize how unethical this is, and instead you firmly stand your ground and argue that it is ""normal"" demonstrates your sense of business ethics. Especially because now you are telling me that you are a former member of the collective? Cool move, bro. However, I bet the Cheeseboard collective appreciates that sign you hung up outside of your establishment giving them a nod. You know which sign I'm talking about, right? The one that doesn't exist. That sign.So justify it however you must. But the fact is your establishment is not--in any way--original. It's not. It's unethical, and it's unoriginal despite your spin on it.  How can you even make an argument of originality? -The business name is Sliver, which is Cheese Board's signature (an extra sliver of pizza with any order).-You opened a MILE down the road. -The green sauce is a duplicate.-Your pizza changes daily, is vegetarian, and is a non-marinara sourdough crust.  -You have a salad of the day.-Often you have live music.-And the core founders of sliver are former Cheese Board members.  Really, the only thing that is missing is a grassy divider with a city ordnance of ""no sitting on the median"" between you and the other side of the street.... Where is this originality you speak of?What makes my experience with your business a negative one isn't so much that you copied somebody else's business and then opened up down the road. It's kind of a dick move, but it's your prerogative. The negative experience doesn't even derive from the fact that you decided to engage in a conversation with me, then deleted your comment (?)...  It's more that you decided to report me to Yelp, only to have Yelp decide my review be reinstated. You are allegedly the owner of this place; own your (nearly stolen) product instead of giving some nonsense PR response, and then telling on me when your nonsense rhetoric fails. Deal with it, your busted dude.If anybody does take the time to read this, please note that I posted the owner's response in the tips section with a picture of his response ( after he deleted it). It's not malicious or anything. It's just a bunch of hot steamy B.S. with a very polite middle finger. This business is ridiculous... Original. lol. Lord have mercy."
6,"This place is a mediocre version of Cheeseboard, or maybe I was unlucky and the person who made my pizza hated their life. It sounded tasty (2 different kinds of mushrooms, onions, goat cheese, Italian cheese), but the result was a greasy mess with way too much cheese and not enough of the other toppings. Pretty disappointing for the price point. Also does pizza really need a bible citation?"
7,"I stopped because I was passing by and slice of the day sounded yummy. Lots of people inside. Since it had such good reviews, I figured why not. Here's why: the crust was too soggy, the cheese layer was way thicker than the crust, and it was SO GREASY. The pesto dipping sauce was terrible. Employees were friendly but that was the only saving grace. It's a Cheeseboard rip-off that can't compete with Cheeseboard in any way."
8,"I hate to do this...two stars. My heart breaks every time I come here( not as often anymore)1. The pizza has changed, it doesn't taste like it used to, the crust it's hard andIt came under cooked  :(  this last time.P2. I miss the owners been around  me and my family enjoy the husband and the wife's smiles and great customer service3. Music blasting so loud it's hard to talk. 4.""Mani"" is a customer that every time we come here once again not that often anymore. He sits on the bar He talks loud enough for everyone to hear.He is rude and very inappropriate person, when Iwas here last time with an old girl friend from out of town he told the bartender that we were there because ""we are his beautiful wife's""  really wtf?So we left. I was going to write a review but I forgot about until I came back.Long story short this Mani guy is super odd he wears sunglasses at night on the bar the whole time. We can't tell what his observing? Makes up uneasy And lastly all the bartenders and staff lets him run the show...owners please save this places come back"
9,"Cheeseboard is way better if you're coming to Berkeley for pizza. Plus the cilantro sauce is wayyy better at Cheeseboard.  The pizza itself isn't bad, Cheeseboard is just better."
10,"Well the pictures look delicious... perfectly baked cheesy goodness. Mmm nope that was not the case.  I was not a fan of the dough. It did not have that perfect combination of crusty crunch & cooked dough.  It was A soggy /half baked crust. I did however like the choice of toppings; asparagus, mushrooms, two types of cheeses. Unfortunately it was not baked to perfection.This is definitely a drunken late night pizza( you can eat anything ) - mediocreThe salad was thrown together, mixed bag lettuce, Square pieces of jicama, I think mozzarella, and dressing that must have been made from a hundred  cloves of garlic per every ounce. ~ ON TO THE NEXT ~"
11,"Angelo, the ""bartender""...the corpse reviver was nothing but triple sec. I returned it because it was gross... I know what a real corpse reviver is supposed to taste like. I asked for a new drink, just a simple gin and soda, which he screwed up. How the hell do you screw up a gin and soda?!?! And he made me pay for it.  No bar etiquette. Sorry, I am not a 21 year old cal student who doesn't know the difference between a good cocktail and some shit you drink in between flippy cup, beer pong, and cards games."
12,"I tried sliver again, but I'm not sure I will again. They were having a holiday special $17.50 for a whole pie, not a bad deal right? I was excited to try the corn and zucchini pizza and share it with my family. So I wait in the long line again, order a pie and a half, half-baked and the cashier rings it up as $30. I ask if it should be $27.50 ($17.50 for the whole, $10 for the half). And he says no. I point out the holiday special sign that says ""$17.50 for a whole pie"" and he says that it doesn't apply because the pizza is not cooked. Now when they normally have a discount on half-baked pie (tax free) why wouldn't the special apply to my order as well? I didn't make a deal about it, paid the $30 and left with a sour taste in my mouth.By the time I came home, I was so hungry, I couldn't have cared less what I paid. I opened the boxes and I realized that I never received my sliver of pizza that the restaurant gets its name for. Like what the heck? I cooked the pizza at 400F for 8 minutes as per instructions, which I believe underestimate the cook time since by the tie you get home, the pie goes from warm to cold. The pie was under flavored and under seasoned. The zucchini was shredded, so I completely didn't taste it and didn't realize it was even in there. The corn added pops of flavor and so did the feta, butthe rest of the pizza was really monotonous. I was really expecting more. Don't really think its worth waiting in the slow moving line for."
13,"""Are they mad at you for ordering a vegan pizza?""-My roommates first words after seeing the so-called pizza I brought home.On Sliver's website, in their FAQs, they proudly state that they can make vegan pizzas. I would not call this sad heap of vegetables on oily flatbread a pizza. There was no sauce/cheese substitute at all! Now, I know what you're thinking: Vegans don't eat cheese, what are you complaining about!? However, there are several vegan substitutes for cheese on a pizza, including cashew sauce, pesto, or (somewhat obviously) vegan cheeses such as Daiya. It's disingenuous for Sliver to sell what I ordered as ""vegan pizza.""Vegans are human too. We need to eat more than corn and bread. Honestly, the pizza I received felt like a cruel joke.If you want vegan pizza, look elsewhere (Pieology and Cheeseboard can make some mean vegan pizza). Sliver obviously doesn't value their vegan customers."
14,"Great location to watch sports. Lots of big screens. And good reasonable prices. But I really want to know what they think they are doing with their pizza. It's disgusting. Always under cooked,  limp and greasy with no crust.  Its like they are trying to emulate new York style, but they don't know how.I'd pass and go get some deep dish or new York style on solano ave."
15,"Good food does not give permission for bad service! I wanted a calm and relaxing Monday dinner with my best friend I hadn't seen in months, and our experience here was a disaster. We ordered the cheese pizza and wine special for $40, which we ordered at around 6:15 pm, and we didn't get our pizza until almost 7 pm! 45 minutes to make a plain cheese pizza?!When we asked about updates, the guy at the bar (light-skinned with thick dark eyebrows and dark hair, younger, slimmer build) rolled his eyes at me and my friend and would say, ""almost done"" with thumbs up. When our pizza was finally done, he came to our table and sarcastically said, ""yay here you go"" and literally threw it on our table and walked off. As he approached the bar again, he looked back at us and stared us down. I'm a manager of my own retail store, and if you can't handle customer service, you need to work at a warehouse away from human interaction. I will NEVER eat their overpriced pizza and wine again in my life. Good food does not equal bad customer service!"
16,"One of the soggiest pizzas I've ever had. The idea is the same as cheeseboard but the execution is dismal. The cheese wasn't melted as freshly made pizzas should be and the entire pizza, from top to crust was encased in oil, which made it a supremely stale pizza. It was so oily that when I held it up, the oil dripped down from the sides.I'd rather get Costco pizza."
17,"I was not impressed, I was pretty disappointed because I heard a lot about this place. The crust has no crisp or doughy texture you have to snatch it with your teeth. No gooey cheese factor, the flavor was good. I probably won't be back though"
18,"Worst customer service I've experienced. I work on campus and wanted to inquire about catering/delivery options with them. I called 6 times total in 2 weeks. Every time, I was told that someone will be calling me back but no one ever did. 3 out of the 6 times, so called manager was actually available but would not even answer the phone call-- he would tell the person who picked up the call ""tell her I will call her back in an hour (or next day or before 5pm)"" The other times, I was told that person (named Amelia) who takes care of all these isn't available but will be at work by 9 am next day, so call back at 9 am the next day. Guess what, she isn't at work either nor any calls have been returned since I left my name and phone number yet again.  It's by far the worst experience that I had as a customer. If you cannot determine if you could assist with delivery/invoicing (possible or not?) as a manager, I do not know what your role is but I find you as a pretty incompetent person. If you do not simply want to have business with us, then just simply say no and stop wasting everyone else's time, too."
19,"Why didn't anyone tell me THERE IS NO TOMATO SAUCE ON THIS PIZZA!!!!!!!  I ordered a large cheese pizza, knowing your basic cheese pizza in NYC only as dough, tomato sauce, and cheese.  BUT NO!  NOT HERE!  It's just dough and cheese!  I was so hungry I ate four slices, but did not enjoy one bite.  Threw the rest of the pie out."
20,"No, they just do one pizza. Its random from day to day, and when I went it had corn on it. If you want a glass of water you can fill up a one ounce plastic cup over and over. Doing one thing a day is not creative, its just saves them money."
21,"Came here because Cheeseboard was closed and reviews said this tasted just as good without the long lines. If I had kept reading, I may have known that they only offer one kind of pizza a day. My husband didn't want the feta so we waited about 10 min for them to make one without feta on half the pizza. That was fine except it was never clear when they had pizza ready if it was ours or not. The two sliver slices of pizza that came on top of our pizza were a poor first impression. Luckily our fresh pizza was better. However, the dough was unexpectedly chewy. I did like the pesto/hazelnut topping that gave the pizza a fresh taste. And the pizza was delicious as leftovers. Overall though I wouldn't come back, nor recommend anyone to try this. I didn't think the pizza was great. There are so many other places to try and on the same block even."
22,"The food was good as usual, but the service was awful.I ordered a bunch of pizza and salad for a business meeting. I was going to pick it up, but I would have had to get it early, so I thought I'd get it delivered during the meeting so the pizzas would be hot. The pizza arrived 45 minutes before the delivery time -- definitely not hot. On top of that, they charged me $25 for the delivery. Not going to get Sliver for future business meetings."
23,This used to be 4 stars but then I became frustrated at how little thought goes into their salads. They taste disgusting as of they mixed random ingredients they had leftover together. Their pizza is super greasy and I ordered the slice and salad combo when I went here. No more.Greasiest pizza I have ever had in my life
24,"Vegan pizza includes: Dough, zucchini, onion, and peppers. $15 for this pizza. No sauce? No vegan cheese? Not too sure about this spot."
25,"I was excited when Sliver opened since I like cheeseboard, but Sliver is very convenient since I take the bus after class.I had it with my friend here on a potato day and it was great! The cashier was very friendly and helpful, but the waitress that cleaned the tables was  definitely making not so subtle hints for us to go as we were finishing our pizza. We got it, thanks. We going now. I got a pizza to go one day when it was corn day. This time, the pizza was plain terrible. When I got home, it was like I had three awkward pieces of puzzles that were out together to make a whole. One part was burnt, another looked undone, and the taste just wasn't what I expected. Is this how they treat to go customers? Give them all the unwanted pieces? Like the poor monster Dr. Frankenstein created. Ugly. And unwanted. Well job well done, Sliver, you're unwanted on my dining table."
26,"When Sliver just opened, I'd definitely be giving this place a consistent 4 or 5 stars. The pizzas were very good, almost the same as Cheeseboards for the most part. However, in the past three months or so, I've felt that the quality in this place has really dropped. I've been getting pizzas that have become increasingly undercooked. The amount of toppings seems a good amount less compared to before, and I believe the prices have slightly increased for halves recently. I probably would have given 3 stars for this review, if not for the pizza last Thursday. They ran out of corn for their pizzas and substituted tomatoes instead as a topping. That in itself was fine, however the pizza was horribly undercooked, and pizza completely falling apart. The hastily added mozzarella on top (added along with the tomatoes I believe) weren't cooked long enough, so they remained extremely sticky and stuck to the slivers that were placed on top. I think it's perfectly fine to make substitutions if you run out of a particular ingredient, but at least try to cook the pizzas fully and try to adjust for the fact you made substitutions."
27,"My friends go to Cheeseboard, but then someone mentioned Sliver....so about 1 month ago, I began the brisk walk on my work break.  Decadent, very tasty, and green sauce is great with it.  Suddenly, the price has gone up (it's MORE  than Cheeseboard now).  It's good, but not THAT GOOD.      Now I will happily patronize the more famous place.    I AM SORRY YOU HAD TO RAISE THE PRICE.  I AM DONE HERE."
28,"With all these fans giving 5 stars, I'm a bit intimidated at writing my review... I will sense much hostility but at least I am somewhat anonymous on Yelp so no one will throw tomatoes at me (would Sliver fans use local organic tomatoes?  haha)[THE SERVICE]Perhaps this incident is one of the biggest factors for my bad impression.  The person in front of me ordered a slice for here and then disappeared, so the waiter walked around the restaurant carrying the pizza to look for the customer, but with no luck.  Five minutes later when the customer still didn't show up,  the waiter just took that same slice, wrapped it up for my to-go order, and gave it to me -__-;; I'm not trying to be super picky, but if they make tons and tons of pizza anyways, it wouldn't hurt to give me a fresh slice, not one that they've been waving around and getting cold.  This is what really distinguishes a commitment to ""the freshest and finest quality"". Service in general is not that great either.  For some reason the people in front of me asked the waitress something, and she was just standing around waiting for something instead of taking orders for other people first.  And I swear, their line is excrutiatingly slower than Cheeseboard!  People working at Cheeseboard are very efficient and the line keeps moving.  Here, it's about as slow as the DC when newbies serve the food (no hard feelings!  I was once one of those n00b food workers ;)[THE FOOD]The pizza is decent, but all the cheese makes it very greasy--the pesto sauce makes it fattier than Cheeseboard).  [THE PRICE]It really confuses me how Cheeseboard has a $$ rating at $2.50 per slice, but Sliver has a $ rating at $2.75 per slice...[THE AMBIANCE]Still hard to find seating.  Also, the bar area is pretty small and happy hour is only 5-7pm... I'd rather go to Beta.It's also smaller, which makes it hard to talk with people when the band is performing.[IN CONCLUSION]Overrated, but I'd come back if my friends wanted to come.  (Just putting it out there so there won't be any that-awkward-moment-when-you-suggest-a-restaurant-that-your-friend-gave-a-terrible-review-to)After all, their pizza is tasty, but honestly, I'd prefer to make Cheeseboard/Sliver-esque pizza myself:  just get crust, add veggies and cheese, and stick it in the oven.  (I'm sure it'd come out to less than $20 per pizza!)"
29,Too much oil and not enough time for ferment .but service is greatOct 27 18:00 or a little bit later.
30,"terrible pizza...ordered the cheese...all that came was bread, grease and burnt tasting cheese.....no one in the house including a 7 year old 44 year old and 50 year old could stand the taste...we threw it out after one slice each...which no one made it through.....ive had bad pizza before....this is new low"
31,"Took the (college) kids out to dinner at Sliver Pizzeria this week.Very collegiate atmosphere with the inside T.V. blasting a football game and people screaming and yelling.  Lots of food on the floor,by the way, so be careful walking around.   The pizza was okay although very greasy and although it was advertised to have feta cheese on it, I didn't see any.  The orange salad dressing that came with our salad was thin and unremarkable and the whole thing was mainly just lettuce thrown around.  Didn't look enticing but the family wanted salad.Our major complaints relate to service -- absolutely horrible.  The young man at the cash register couldn't even tell us what the pizza of the day was -- he said ""just look at the board, I don't know.""  When we asked for some utensils, another person looked at us and just walked away.Bathrooms were filthy.  Be forewarned.  No toilet paper in one of them.This is definitely a collegiate experience and perhaps one worth having occasionally.  But the pizza was not stellar and combined with the lousy and indifferent service and parking issues, probably (for our money) not a joint worth returning to."
32,This is as low as I could go. I've gotten delivery before but the one day I decide to go here they serve pizza with cilantro on it. Disgusting! If you're only going to serve one pizza make it something not so disgusting. Be warned check the menu before going here.
33,"First they pirate everything about the Cheeseboard without the positive business model, then they follow that up with inconsistent service and quality. Today's experience provided us with a horrible, cold pizza which was clearly pieced together from pieces of several left over, cold pies. Some well overcooked. Some well undercooked.  Inedible. They should be ashamed. Their reaction to our complaint only added insult to injury. Boo!"
34,"Sloppy. Despite what I was told, there were no instructions on the box for the to-go pizza I ordered. Dropped 45 bucks and they didn't bother to spare 10sec to tell me how to best cook the pizza at home. Go to Cheese Board, where customers are actually valued."
35,"This place is really unfriendly to people who don't eat dairy. I've avoided this place because I know they do pizza, but when friends wanted to go here, I decided to give their vegan pizza a shot. They don't sell vegan pizza by slice, I had to buy a whole pie. For one person, that's too much. Instead I got a salad which taste like crap. I'm never coming back here again."
36,"I don't understand why people rave about this place. I have been to cheeseboard, and this ain't cheeseboard. If you only do one style of pizza per day, you better do it well and this place underwhelmed. The slices were very greasy and the crust was soggy and the ingredients nondescript. I had no idea what I was eating, and the ingredients did not taste very high quality. I do like the little bar there that serves yummy sangria, though. Maybe I just came on an off day, but it was very disappointing."
37,Only makes one type of pizza a day. Very over priced. Loud unpleasant atmosphere. Staff is nice.
38,"I have gotten pizza to go from Sliver a couple times, so I can't really comment on the atmosphere of the restaurant, although it looks like a fun place to be.I have had Cheese Board, and this place basically tastes the same to me. To be frank, I'm not crazy about the CB either. In my opinion, the pizza at each places suffers from the same fatal flaw: Way too much olive oil. Way too much.It's just greasy and the garlic taste of the olive oil just overwhelms the rest of the pizza. It's a shame because the ingredients are always really fresh and tasty. However, the only thing I can taste after finishing the pizza is the garlic olive oil. It doesn't really sit well in my stomach either. I'd much rather have BUILD of Bobby G's."
39,"Totally overrated. The pizza absolutely DROWNS in fat. Before you even reach your table, the pizza carton is already see-through. I used about 25 napkins to soak all the unnecessary oil up. The pizza also tastes like nothing, and I mean, literally nothing. It all sounds superb when you read the dozen ingredients but eventually none of them have a predominant flavor or any taste for that matter.You get an oily piece of bread with a thick layer of cheese. I mean, you can't even see what's on there.Overall a really bad pizza place which only survives due to it's infamous ""fame""... Huge disappointment."
40,"Potatoes on pizza. Really!? Seriously! That was the topping of the day. My gosh, that is just not right. To top it off, they added several herbs... except chives, which goes so well with potatoes! If you are crazy enough to add potatoes, at least add the most complimentary herb.Their combinations are nowhere near as creative and delicious as Cheeseboard. Never going here again."
41,"I used to really like the pizza here, but they lost my business today. In the past, they used to put out tap water for guests to drink, but today the dispenser was empty with a sign saying that they were not putting it out anymore because of the drought. I am all for water conservation, and while I think this is a misunderstanding of the new CA state law which states restaurants cannot serve water to customers who do not request it, not that restaurants cannot provide self-serve water (waterboards.ca.gov/water…), I was not too troubled, as I assumed I could get some if I asked for it. After my husband and I purchased our half pizza we asked for two cups of water, and were told they are not giving out tap water at all anymore, and we were told that we could buy one of their many drink options. The reason they gave was because of the drought. I do not think this makes sense. No water conservation guideline ever has recommended drinking less water to combat the drought. And in fact, drinking bottled water is a much larger drain on the environment than tap water (for just one example: news.nationalgeographic.…)Maybe they merely mis-interpreted the new law, but since now the only option is to not have anything to drink, or purchase a bottled drink, the company is  financially benefitting. Moreover, the options drink options include drinks like San Pellegrino, which (while delicious), has been owned my Nestle since 1977. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa…) . As you may have heard in the news Nestle is one of the companies under the most scrutiny for their practices during the drought, which include bottled water and shipping it (cnbc.com/id/101892496). So in fact, by not offering tap water to those who ask for it, more people are likely to buy drinks, which actually may be supporting companies whose behaviors are undoubtedly not 'water conscious'. We asked to speak to the manager and requested that he explain the policy, and he started telling us about the ongoing drought, when I started to explain that he was misinterpreting the law, and that buying bottled water was worse for water conservation, he said that he could only provide water if the customer has a medical condition.In short, the company is profiting off the drought, and, not only that, but trying to appear that they are doing it for environmentally conscious reasons, which I think is unethical. Maybe it was not intentional, but, in this case, they have clearly not thought very deeply about their new policy. If they have decided they are no longer going to provide water because they want to make more money, fine. They are allowed to do that. But trying to pretend that they are doing it because they are being water conscious, is not right. They have lost my business."
42,This place is not what people make it out to be. It took 5mins to get a drink WE WERE SITTING AT THE BAR.  The bartender just kept talking to one of the guys in the kitchen. She did not explain that there was a difference in size pizza. She basically  said what do you want not happy  at all. I paid for my watered down jack and coke and left. This place is a wannabe cheeseboard. Never coming here again
43,"This is a bad mockery of Cheeseboard, and apparently it is made by past cheeseboard founders. All I know is I like to stick to my roots and Cheeseboard is where it's at. This place is way less busy despite it being across from the campus. They copy the business model of Cheeseboard and just add more cheese and oil. The ONLY thing I like better about this place is that they offer the green sauce at all times everyday...the sauce also created by Cheeseboard. I don't want to sound like the ultimate hater--I do go here occasionally. But, if the option is pick a pizza place then Cheeseboard wins by a long shot and it's just up the street. Support the originals"
44,"Nothing wrong with their pizza per se, but it's a complete ripoff of Cheese Board. I can't see how any restaurant can have pride in food plagiarism.With your CB kitchen skills it would have been much more noble of you to create a different style pizza. My recommendation is that when you're in north berkeley go to CB (less floppy crust than Sliver) and when you're downtown go to Bobby G's on University just west of Shattuck.Sad commentary."
45,"They kind of copied the Cheeseboard model and did it well. The first couple of times I came here I was impressed. The problem is the place has outsmarted itself. The bistro-like menu, where you get the one item they are making that day, is a killer for me. Sometimes you get something good, but the last 4 times I have  bothered to walk down there the toppings on the pizzas have been atrocious. I do not want figs and arugula on a pizza. It feels like they are getting bored and have to push some California cuisine menu on you. You do not have to break new ground daily people. Your pizza is good, they way you serve it and sell it is good, the crust is good, the ingredients are fresh. Now make a damn pizza! To explore a little is great, but that crap every day? I'll go to Chez Panisse to explore my palette thanks. 1-2 more visits with a strike-out menu and I'll quit bothering to come and  check if you actually serve pizza.I'm also glad that embedded in my purchase of pizza is a political statement - finally I don't have to worry about human trafficking anymore as I've done my part! What a relief. Sorry, but I find commodifying an issue in order to sell more of a product somewhat despicable, and totally disingenuous."
46,"I used to be a total pizza slob.  I would eat basically any vegetarian pizza; and I didn't care about how fattening it was, how cold it was, how unevenly it was cooked, or how greasy it was.All of this was true until I tried Sliver.  I'm still a partial pizza slob, but whereas I once didn't believe that a pizza could be too greasy, I have now seen the error of my ways.  Sliver's pizzas are too greasy.  They're dripping and drowning and asphyxiating and choking and gurgling and slip-sliding and pickling in oil.  And I don't care how high-quality the oil is; they use too much of it.It's really a shame, too, because Sliver has interesting-sounding pizzas.  (The menu changes daily.)  But no matter how fresh and organic and creative the ingredients are, it doesn't really matter.  The oil kills all of it.  All of it.I have no idea how this place is rated so high on Yelp.  Maybe it's because there's cheap beer.  Maybe it's because Center Street hasn't had a strictly pizza place in years.  Maybe it's just collective insanity, kind of like the daycare sex scandals of the '80s or the post-September 11 terrorism paranoia that infects almost every aspect of American culture.Whatever it is, all y'all who have given Sliver more than two stars are crazy and actually a little bit disingenuous.  You're writing Yelp reviews, so please be honest.  The pizza sucks.Oh, and the place gets two stars because it's cute and inviting and full of unrealized potential.  Yes, human-trafficking is bad, but I'm not going to eat crappy pizza just because I want there to be fewer sex slaves in the world."
47,"Great pizza, fraudulent pricing.The pizza at Sliver is tasty and an excellent value, although I think Cheeseboard (their original model) does far better -- all of Sliver's pies end up tasting quite similar.What earns them one star is their fraudulent pricing. As of August 2013, they list the price of a slice as $2.50 on their menu board but charge $2.75 including tax. That's 2 cents more than Berkeley's 9.00% sales tax.I could care less about paying two extra pennies. What bothers me is that they are pricing their pizza deceptively -- if you get a bill, it rings up at $2.52 + tax. They used to list their price as $2.75 (including tax), so this was an intentional change.Edit -- Guillermo, please read my review again, I think you missed my main point. It's being charged more than the listed price that bothers me."
48,"I ordered a whole pizza for my family, gave a $5 tip when I paid.... my friend ordered a  slice..he got it, a bunch of folks behind us in line got theirs. After about 25 minutes, I asked them how much longer.. THEY HAD NO IDEA ABOUT MY PIZZA... started looking in the receipts to give me a refund..I had 4 people at home waiting for a pizza!!! they could've done what was right and make me the pizza that I ordered and paid for... but instead they told me it's too late.. THE GIRL AT THE COUNTER WHO WAS WORKING September 23rd, 2015 SHOULD BE FIRED (not only did she screw up my order, she was also very rude)"
49,"The one star is not a judgement on the quality of their food.I sent two e-mails to the address listed on their website without receiving a response.  I wanted to know if the cheese in their pizzas contain animal rennet, which should be easy to answer for a place that claims to source their ingredients from ""local farmers.""  I called and the person who picked up had no idea what was in their cheese.  I'm assuming the manager should know, but for some reason has chosen not to respond to my emails. I'll stick to cheeseboard since they're always able to tell me which of their cheeses are truly vegetarian."
50,"Basically Cheeseboard but not as good. Tastes nearly the same, but less greasy and the flavors aren't as strong. It's also a bit more rubbery, and usually a bit burnt.This place is fine if you're craving this type of pizza and you don't want to go that far to Cheeseboard (if you're a student), but if transportation isn't an issue, go with Cheeseboard any day."
51,"Pizza-it's ok on certain days when the crust isn't as thick. Cheeseboard all the way!!!I like the fact that they have live music, but last night my friends and I went to see Rusty Zinn and his band to hear some reggae music and the sports fans were so loud we couldn't hear the music nor could we hear ourselves talk among each other. What is this place, a pizza/music venue or a sports bar??1 more thing, customer service not so good, -----good customer service depends on who is working!!  Good Luck!!!!!!!!!I don't think I'll be back CHEESEBOARD HERE WE COME!!!!"
52,"I was brought here by a colleague when I was visiting our Berkeley office.  I've never heard of cheeseboard so I'm not complaining that they ripped off the concept and the truth is I like the concept.  Reasonably cheap pizza with interesting topics, a good atmosphere cheap beers and wine as well.  Because they only have one variety for the day it means your pizza isn't made to order so we were able to get ours in like 5 minutes, which was super convenient.  The problem for me is I just didn't like the pizza.  It wasn't the toppings (though I was there on kind of a boring day, tomatoes and some other drowned in the cheese), it was the crust.  Just kind of greasy and tasteless.  It was even worse the next day.  Pizza is one of those things that is really subjective.  I tend to like Neapolitan style.  Regardless, this wasn't good for me."
53,"I'm not a fan. I know that this is a hot spot in Berkeley, but my pizza was bland and drowned in grease. I'm sorry, but if you're only going to offer one type of pizza a day, it better be a darn good pizza."
54,They have lots of space to seat and a very fast service. Like the fact that they have TV to watch sports. The bar is nice so are the people who work there. Now to the negative point: their pizza it's just excessively/extremely greasy; oil basically drips down with every bit. Please cut back on the oil and it will taste as good.
55,"We were rudely kicked out at closing time, and there are no meat options."
56,"The worst delivery experience EVER !!!I ordered online a 6:20 on Sunday and they accepted my order (they close at 7pm on Sunday).At 7:20 a guy from delivery.com call me saying that they can't deliver because they are closed !!! Really ?A piece of advice, don't pretend you can deliver when you actually can't.Be sure I'll spread the word about that."
57,"I don't get what the big deal is. I don't want to pay $2.50 for a cold slice of over-salted pizza. Then, they made me wait a ridiculously long time to pay. I ended up just going to the front of the payment line and handing them $3 (because I didn't have change) so I could leave. I get what they're trying to do, but I'm not a fan. I'd much rather go to Pizziaolo in Temescal or even Blondie's on Telegraph."
58,I might not be blind but I don't see what the hype is about... I'm also not into very thin crust pizza.  Yea the toppings are good and the cause is good but it doesn't make the pizza good.  I did get a bit buzzed there and the honey basil beer totally works with the pizza.
59,"Plagiarized pizza, anyone?If it looks like Cheeseboard and tastes like Cheeseboard, maybe it's because 3 ex-Cheeseboarders took the look and taste of this Berkeley institution and copied it a few blocks away, closer to campus, competing for business with the very place that gave them so much of their experience.  Don't be fooled: this is NOT a new branch of Cheeseboard.  It's a shady copy.One veggie pizza a day?  Live music?  Quote of the day?  Seriously?  You guys couldn't have opened in SF or Oakland instead?And is it a co-op?  No.  Walk a little bit farther to support the real thing."
60,"I was excited to check this place out after seeing all the great reviews - especially after seeing that people thought it was as good as Cheeseboard (my favorite pizza place in the world). My boyfriend and I had lunch there today and I have to say I was extremely disappointed with how unoriginal the place is. It's a complete copy of Cheeseboards layout/idea...except with a snobby suit-and-tie atmosphere. The only reason the line was long and slow was because the personnel were unorganized and couldn't keep up with orders very well (maybe this is because they are brand new..I guess I should cut them a little slack). Exact same size and prices for slices and pies as Cheeseboard. The biggest difference between this place and the original Cheeseboard? The pizza at Sliver is ok...doesn't come anywhere NEAR the quality of CB. It's nice to have a healthier pizza option close to campus...but I'd never choose this place over CB. The bread and cheese do not compare. The reason I'm making so many comparisons is because all of these other reviews are very misleading. Overall a big let down, but good enough for something fast, healthy-ish and close to campus for students."
61,"If what I've been hearing that ""Silver"" is founded by past ""Cheeseboard"" co-owners, then this is twice the disappointment because I imagine when you have a good business model executed well and you break away with a new business is because you are building upon, improving, not downgrading as in Silver's case.During the handful of times I have been to Silver I have enjoyed the music and the outdoors sitting but not the poor counter service and worse the terrible pizza.  Waiting in line, although never pleasant, is something I would do if the food is good but waiting in line for bad food plus attitude added is not something I welcome neither something I will pay for.Bottom line, the pizza could easily improve and the attitude can be readjusted, the outdoors sitting is nice and the music adds to it, the prices are OK, perhaps you can even consider table service and offer a couple of jobs instead of going for the MacDonalds order your food at the counter, bus your own table model.  Good location.  Good luck."
62,"Stood in the line at the bar last night to order a beer. Reached the front of the line.Bartender found a dozen things to do--for ten minutes-- other than acknowledge my presence and serve me a drink. Pointed this out to him, loudly, I'm afraid; then left, to drink somewhere more hospitable....I've had their pizza: it's good; so are the people who serve it.It's just the bartender who is a complete schmuck."
63,"The pizza has gotten worse and worse.  I bought pizzas to take to a final class meeting and I was embarrassed at how bad it was....soggy with oil, the crust was under risen and tough as nails.  It was also oddly lacking in taste--and though the menu listed corn as an ingredient, I couldn't find a kernel.  They need some quality control."
64,"PIzza not very flavorful, kind of cardboard-ey.  Definitely not favorful like Cheeseboard which it seems to imitate.  Wish I had gone around the corner to Jupiters for Pizza.  Screaming drunk chicks.  The cocktails must be why the reviews are so great.  I love the location.  Wish Arinell's or Gioia or Cheeseboard had this location"
65,"Hilariously disgusting. You might have to be a college kid who's never tasted anything but nasty cafeteria food to enjoy this pizza. Burnt cheese flavor, astoundingly greasy, and unchewable."
66,"I was very disappointed with the pizza here, mainly because the wonderful aromas that brought me in did not translate into a tasty fulfilling slice of pie! I think it's cool that they have a ""pizza of the day"" and I'm sure it is exciting to experiment with different toppings & unusual flavors, but some things just do not compliment each other. At all. Came in here yesterday, Wednesday's pizza was zucchini, white onions, red onions, mozzarella cheese, french feta, and all topped with pesto sauce. Ehhhh... sounds harmless enough... I guess. But why all the onions? And french feta WITH mozzarella? I mean, a little much. The weird after taste of the white onions combined with all that cheese did not make for a pleasant mixture. For some reason it gave my zucchini's this twangy taste that made it hard to finish without picking them off. Actually I ended up picking all the stuff off and was left with my slightly soggy bread. I've had worse and even weirder combinations, but I was expecting to enjoy this more based on all the raving reviews.I will give a nice shout out to the girl working the counter. It was really swamped when I came in and the chicks directly behind me in the line were being obnoxious about how ""disorganized"" and confusing it was to order your food. She was pretty calm about it and kept up with the line as best as she could by herself, considering that she was taking orders, using the register AND handing out the food at the counter."
67,"They did a great job at copying Cheeseboard's pizza and even their green sauce.  Every time I eat there I always get a whiff of cigarette smoke from those smoking on the curb.  My pizza then all of a sudden tastes like cigarette ashes.  Patrons are usually young, perhaps from campus, and they tend to be on the selfish side like save seats for their friends while there are people with food and beer towed in their arms asking them if the seat is empty.  One time the cashier asked if we were going to leave tip. This has never happened anywhere before. Tips are earned not asked for!  We take the extra time to go to Cheeseboard instead where the air is cleaner, patrons are more considerate, and staff have never asked for tip."
68,"Pizza is great but I just cannot deal with this obvious for-profit Cheeseboard rip off.  Cheeseboard is an amazing worker-owned cooperative.  Sliver has taken their main product, repackaged it in a more convenient location right down the street, and added a bar.  Now, intellectual property isn't a big deal in the restaurant world, and shouldn't be, but this is way too close, and will obviously take customers away from Cheeseboard.  Lame."
69,"Before i rant I just want to say that the pizza here is fantastic. I decided to go to sliver being that it was a co-workers last day of work and well what's better than beer and pizza. I would be giving this place 5 stars if it weren't for the bartender who gave my debit card to someone who was not me because my last name is Chang and well of course every asian person's last name is Chang! No joke! I opened up a tab after I purchased a couple slices b/c I knew I was going to be there for a bit. So when I decided to get a refill on my beer I told the guy to please add it to my tab. He asked me my name and I told him. after some searching through the cup they keep the credit cards in, he asks me if he gave it back to me. I said of course not I opened a tab. so he did his best to placate me with beer and pizza and well  it worked but seriously WTF. So after 15 min I return to see if any progress had been made and to get a refill.This guy tells me ""so I know exactly what happened. I was chatting up some asian kid and when he was ready to leave I told him hahahaha I bet your card is the one with Chang as the last name. So I swiped your card, gave it to the asian guy, and he took off....funny right?"" So not only did it piss me off that this guy thinks that every asian kid has Chang as his last name but that he was soooooo FN smart he gave my card to someone whose name wasn't even close to  mine. So there I was canceling my debit card b.c of this smart guy. I will never eat here again even though I loved the pizza. I'd rather go to the Cheeseboard b.c they actually hire people that care and are about the community that they serve."
