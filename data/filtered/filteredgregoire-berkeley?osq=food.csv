decided walk crispy potato puffs 6 white truffle essence 2 quick snack since long line formed cheese board jokes us person waiting got got potato puffs even though line shorter waited approximately 15 mins potato puffs bit long wait say potato puffs thought okay order includes nine pieces basically creamy mashed potatoes inside crispy deepfried exterior dipping sauce provided flavor potato puffs overall potato puffs okay snack wouldnt theres long wait
horrible customer service specifically young guy pony tail working cashier always pleasant gegoire location friendly staff consistent however past weekend young gentleman cashier extremely rude didnt even ask wanted order saw standing come ask could order sarcastically asked wanted loudly seemed annoyed gregoire management either train giving decent respectable customer service pleasant fire
came see hype eating see potato puffs popular im big fan potato puffs despite cook didnt wait long potato puffs least day came hereseating scarce limited two small tables bench like seating dont shy ask dine table complete strangers party fit coursei look forward dining
potato puffs truffle essence sineggplant lavash sandwich enough eggplant much lettuce robbed star ingredients flavor needed little something make averageorder took quite awhile problem waiting worth limited seating people take go
