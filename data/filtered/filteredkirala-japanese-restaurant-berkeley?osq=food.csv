line outside restaurant arrived taken requested sushi bar seats 2030 minute wait service worth waiting fantastic throughout meal dined person initially expecting light snack ending staying longer ordering bottle sake two dishes  if server minded us ordering something new multiple times throughout meal didnt show  we sat front grill enjoyed watching chef work talked occasionally asking patrons ordered taking mental notes future visits gentleman next us ordered spare ribs slid right bone  what liked simple beautifully presented crazy sauces bells whistles smoke mirrors etc laid pleasing way begged enjoyed miso soup hot yummy sashimi wonderful cold soba noodles delicious  looking forward next meal already
3 sushi rolls barely fish id surprised even ounce fish per roll little fish much rice could mainly taste rice couldnt even appreciate fish taste excited weeks finally try kirala always huge wait went later dinner rush 8pm wait 20 minutes tolerable maybe sushi dinner includes lot nagiri worth money highly recommend dont order sushi rolls
