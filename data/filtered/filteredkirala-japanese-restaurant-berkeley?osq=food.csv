coming 16 years usually area shopping bowl bit hate relationship quality kind coming going economy cycle right better 2 years ago way better 12 years agowednesday 7 pm wait know japanese kaiseki style cuisine  aka imperial court haute cuisine served japan think organize meal fashion offer sushi fresh grilled varies veggies meat fresh non initiated teriyaki robata maybe ones offer authentic ones bay area experience number years trial error faith renewed
echo earlier reviewers popular  no reservations tried beat rush getting 6pm friday  yikes  we waited 45 minutes seated  place packed bar overflowing semiyell across table heard  i starving decided forego sushi favor something filling  waitress curt  ohitashi cold spinach smokey bonito flakes  i excited see seafood gyoza usual japanese pork filling disappointing flavorless dipping sauce add  i tempted almondcrusted shrimp tempura 10 shrimp decided go regular tempura price still shrimp vegetables well  this thing ate  dipping sauce grated ginger touch  grilled shiitake goodsteamed rice managed mushy crunchy  not  i appreciate offer several cold sakes small carafes  the ordered described green apple flavor  a bit sweet liking  both glass carafe tiny glass sake glass lovely  my husband lowcarbing ordered five robata items  he wasnt moon  the bill including small sake excluding tip 75  not worth next time area well look elsewhere
 it lives hype  theres long line make sure time put name wait outside table  everything tried  im trusting spot wont affected honda moving old mountain space next store  it absolute tragedy moved
let preface saying although havent 2017 yet familys goto japanese since yelp existed probably biased well selectively bit extra critical tempura appetizer crispy perfection usual fish sushi dinner fresh could see reflection critique today seaweed salad appetizer could drained bit thats splitting hairs final verdict still japanese spot bay area imo btw sure 1520 minutes early usually long line outside
toro enjoyed  the rest average  had nigiri none standout enough inspire order roll  ahi night bigeye tuna texture color flavor memorable  uni white king salmon could went without though  red crab waste time  most patrons getting cooked orders guess sushi isnt greatest  i tried lamb robato grill found overcooked awesome flavor heard gindara black cod therestick toro certifiable price item  the sushi chefs cut precision big portions terrible
